In the 1330’s, Petrarch coined the phrase ‘the dark ages’ to describe the millennium that had preceded him. He portrayed these years as a period of cultural, economic and intellectual stagnation in which the progression of the human race slowed significantly. Petrarch believed that since the ‘Roman Empire had fallen to the barbarians… barbarianism had continued ever since[^1]. This was a rather eurocentric view, but was to some extent, true. Europe did indeed regress in some ways, caused in part by the loss of knowledge and the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Whilst contemporary scholars disagree, arguing that the ‘dark ages’ were not the period of stasis that they are often characterised to be, as Europe began to progress once again in the late Middle Ages, the area of the world that had rapidly developed during this period emerged as the driving force. The Arab and Islamic world, in stark contrast to Europe, had experienced a renaissance of thought and culture. A multitude of different art forms flourished, and contemporary philosophers revolutionised philosophy and theology, not only in the Arab world but in Europe as well. This period was known as the Islamic Golden Age, so named for the flourishing of culture and thought during it. The products of this period had an enormous effect on Europe and the Western world, and arguably kick-started the re-gaining of knowledge in the West after its loss following the fall of the Western roman empire. In this essay, I shall explore to what extent western scholarship was and has been influenced by philosophy Islamic Golden Age and uncover the effects that this influence had on the West, both contemporary and future. I shall focus on two aspects: the revival of classical knowledge; and the impact on theology and its wider impact. It can be argued that these are the two most important areas on which Islamic philosophy had an influence. I shall contrast the two, and eventually conclude that the revival of classical knowledge is indebted far more to Islamic philosophy and its scholars than theology. The philosophers that have been identified as the most prominent and influential of the age are Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, and Al-Farabi, and it therefore follows that these shall be the main focus of the essay.

## Theology

The clearest influence that can be seen was the impact on theological thought. Whilst the thinkers of the Middle East were, of course, adherents to Islam, the influences of their theory was not simply limited to Islamic doctrine. Christianity, specifically the Catholic Church, incorporated elements of Islamic Philosophy, and was heavily guided by the ideas of prominent Islamic philosophers. The most obvious examples of this was the relationships between two philosophers with a large corpus of Aristotelian commentaries, Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd (latinised to Avicenna and Averroes respectively), and Thomas Aquinas.
</br>

### Interaction
#### Aquinas’ debt to Ibn Sina

Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) is widely regarded as one of the Catholic church’s greatest theologian, and is the most famous of his time. His unfinished magnum opus, *Summa Theologica*, and his other major work *Summa contra Gentiles*, have established him as such. His work not only covered theology, but also extended to Philosophy. In this regard, he was an Aristotelian, and his interpretation of Aristotle’s work went on to become the official doctrine of Catholicism, henceforth known as Thomism. Whilst his early understanding of Aristotle came from his own personal interpretation of the translations of William of Moeberke, much of his deeper understanding of the man whom he revered as simply ‘The Philosopher’ was established through the reading of commentaries on his work. The most prominent of these was written by Ibn Sina.

Ibn Sina (980-1037) wrote a number of seminal works during his lifetime, including: _Kitāb al-shifā_, which translates to ‘Book of the Cure’, and was an exposition of logic, mathematics, physics and metaphysics; _Al-Qānūn fī aṭ-Ṭibb,_ translating to ‘The Canon of Medicine’, and was an encyclopaedic account of medicine at the time; and _Al-Nijat_, the full title of which translates to ‘salvation from falling into the sea of misguidances’, a major philosophical volume. Such was the size of his corpus that he produced meant that it was bound to be transmitted to Europe and to the Christian world. His works found their way to one Thomas Aquinas, who utilised them to great effect, especially the commentaries on Aristotle. 

The most obvious influence on Aquinas can be seen in early versions of his ‘doctrine of creation’. Aquinas is notable for having written an extensive commentary on Peter Lombard’s *Sentences*. Taking a question and answer form, Aquinas comments on various aspects of Lombard’s doctrine. In Sentences II, d. 1, q. 1, a. 2, entitled ‘Whether anything can proceed from him by creation?’, it can be observed that Aquinas draws on Ibn Sina’s interpretation of Aristotle heavily. Aquinas makes three assumptions in putting forth his doctrine: 

P1: Nothing can pre-exist the highest being (i.e. God)
P2: In created things, non-being precedes being
C1: Therefore, created things depend totally and continuously on a first cause or first being[^2]

These assumptions are taken from Aquinas’ understanding of Ibn Sina’s interpretation of Aristotle. In his *Metaphysics*, Ibn Sina argues for the ontological dependence of all created things on a first cause[^3]. As a result of this argument, Aquinas is able to argue for the lack of mutual exclusiveness between the concepts of *creatio ab aeterno* (an everlasting universe) and *creatio ex nihilo* (creation from nothingness), utilising more of Ibn Sina’s doctrine, as follows:

In Sentences II, d. 1, q. 1, a. 5, (‘Whether the world is eternal?’), in Objection 7, Aquinas argues that it is impossible for the world to not be eternal:

> “the Creator of the world either preceded the world by nature alone or also by duration. If it is by nature alone, as a cause precedes its effect, then whenever the Creator was, the thing created was. And thus the world is eternal. But if it is by duration, then, since "before" and "after" in duration cause the notion of time, before the whole world there was time, and this is impossible, since time is an accident of motion and does not exist without motion. Therefore, it is impossible that the world has not always been.”[^4]

Following this argument, Aquinas specifically credits Avicenna - “And this is the argument of Avicenna in his *Metaphysics*”[^5] - and continues to do so throughout this Article. Aquinas concludes that the even if the world is eternal, it could still have been created. Due to the arguments of Ibn Sina (along with some presented by Ibn Rushd), he is able to argue that the temporal beginning of the world is irrelevant to the question of ontological dependence upon a first cause, and therefore *creatio ab aeterno* and *creatio ex nihilo* are not mutually exclusive.

In contemporary theology, such a conclusion was groundbreaking. The possibility of *creatio ex nihilo* affirms multiple central claims of Christianity: the necessary existence of God as the only being who cannot not be; the free will of God; and the sole omnipotence of God[^6]. Logical affirmation of what had been presented in both the Old and New Testaments allowed the church to claim that the Christian theory of creation was indisputably correct, as well as their interpretation of God. As well as giving stock to contemporary ideas, the possibility of *creatio ex nihilo* also confirmed the theories of previous theologians, such as Boethius in his *Consolation of Philosophy* (whom Aquinas specifically references). As such, the position of the Church was significantly strengthened.

</br>

#### Aquinas’ conflict with Ibn Rushd

Ibn Rushd (1126-1198AD) assisted Aquinas with some arguments for *creatio ex nihilo*, although to a much lesser extent. However, in terms of his relationship with Aquinas, he is best known for his doctrine of Averroism. Aquinas was tasked with reconciling Averroism with the official theological stance of the Catholic church, and his resolution of this issue formed the basis of Thomism, which would become the official doctrine of the church.

The primary controversy between Averroism and the Christian faith is that a central tenet of Averroism is that reason and philosophy are superior to knowledge that is founded in faith[^7]. Of course, this view was considered to be a major threat to Christian theology, and was condemned as a ‘dangerous’. Aquinas responded with his own interpretation of theological reasoning: our faith in eternal salvation demonstrates that we can know theological truths which exceed human reasoning[^8]. He also proposes that some truths are accessible to faith, but not to philosophy, and that a statement can be true by faith, but false by reasoning. He concludes that we can use wisdom (in this case, he refers to practical wisdom as conceived by Aristotle) to know the truths of faith. He proposes that wisdom is an aid in understanding ‘higher’ truths. This conclusion allowed him to find a place for philosophical reasoning, within his own doctrine of Thomism, and therefore reconcile the theology of the church and the theories of Ibn Rushd.

Another controversy arises in Ibn Rushd’s interpretation of Aristotle that humans do not have our own, personal, intellect; rather, there is one Agent Intellect that abstracts intelligibles, and another shared Material Intellect that receives intelligibles. In other words, the Agent Intellect is not a faculty of the soul, and thus Aristotle did not teach the immortality of the soul[^9]. This interpretation is at odds with Christian teaching, which proposes that the soul is not only eternal, but will be reunited with the body. Aquinas argues against the Averroist view, claiming that understanding can only truly be possessed if my own individual agent intellect abstracts intelligibles, and my own individual possible intellect receives them[^10]. This is a sound response, and reinforces the reconciliation of the two doctrines.

Averroism had a positive impact upon many other philosophers: Boethius drew from it significantly, and John of Jandun took particular interest in a ‘double-truth’ theory of faith and reason[^11]. Descartes revised the theory and intended to use it in order to “suborn the religious adherence of the many”[^12] in order to encourage the masses to heed his teachings. However the main focus remains on Aquinas, due to the overwhelming influence of Thomism, which shall be explored below. 

</br>

### Wider Influence

It can be clearly observed here, as previously stated, that the main influence of Islamic Philosophy in terms of theology was on Aquinas. This ultimately manifested in the form of Thomism, the doctrine of Aquinas himself and adopted by the Catholic Church as their official doctrine. In terms of theology, the impact of Thomism remained primarily within the church, resolving inner turmoil and strengthening the official position of the church upon various theological issues (as argued previously). Whilst the influence of the church upon society and the deep roots that it had in all aspects of contemporary life cannot be understated, from this standpoint, the influence of Islamic philosophy upon the West as a whole was limited, as it was reserved for clergymen and theologians, rather than the regular parishioner. However, it must be pointed out that Thomism is not limited to a theological theory, but rather Aquinas’ epistemological and ethical views formed their own non-theistic philosophy. This allowed Thomism to escape confinement to religious discourse, and to play a part in Western philosophical thought.

The interaction of Renaissance Humanist and Thomist scholars had particularly positive outcomes, specifically in the revival of ancient knowledge and language. The frequent public debates between Humanists and Thomists caused an increased interest in the Aristotelian and Platonic corpuses in the Western world, as well as classical and biblical languages[^13], a well-documented characteristic of the renaissance. Of course, this is not to say that the Humanist-Thomist interaction was the sole cause of the revival of knowledge, but it was important nonetheless.

The part that Thomism played in the wider world was, and remains, relatively limited. Whilst in Theology it had a profound effect, in terms of a wider context, its effect was very little, save for its influence on Humanism. Even in this case, it cannot be argued that Islamic scholarship and philosophy had any direct influence, nor can it be asserted that what little influence it did have was at all consequential.
</br>

## The Revival of Classical Knowledge

During the Islamic Golden Age, the corpus of works that were translated from Greek to Arabic was immense. As such, Islamic scholarship based upon these ancient Greek works saw a sharp increase, leading to the creation of many commentaries on Aristotle (As written by Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd) and Plato (As written by Al-Farabi) primarily, as well as commentary on the Galenic and Ptolemaic corpuses. The sheer number of these commentaries (131 textual items were translated[^14]) gave rise to a new form of translation movement, to translate from Arabic into Latin, and therefore transmit this ancient knowledge into the western world. ‘Scriptoriums’ sprang up in metropolises such as Baghdad, but also in smaller towns such as Toledo. The role of these cannot be understated in the revival of classical knowledge, and such a revival is responsible almost entirely for the knowledge of the thinkers of antiquity that philosophers past and present have had. It must be stressed that a great deal of classical knowledge had been lost due to numerous factors, such as the burning of the library of Alexandria, especially the works of Aristotle, who was considered an obscure figure, his works equally so. Therefore, the revival of said knowledge was a major milestone in the field of philosophy. A few individuals characterised this, and it is these whom shall be focused on in this analysis.

</br>

### Al-Farabi and Neo-Platonism

The majority original works of Plato were, unfortunately, not translated into Arabic (and therefore not into Latin). The was partly due to the fact that Arabic translators found it difficult to render Plato’s Greek into Arabic due to a large amount of metaphorical and figurative language, and also due to the issue that some of Plato’s philosophy is incompatible with Islam[^15]. A substantial amount of knowledge lived on through the Neo-Platonist tradition (this having been founded by Plotinus in the third century CE) in the intervening years between Plato’s death and the Islamic Golden Age, but only a few scholars provided any substantial commentary on or utilisation of Plato’s works, and his corpus had been largely ignored[^16]. Al-Kindi (801-873 CE), widely regarded as the first Islamic philosopher, took some interest in Neo-Platonism, but this interest was largely academic, again due to the incompatibility of Islam and Platonism[^17]. The real father of Islamic Neo-Platonism, and therefore the man responsible for much of the Platonist revival in the West as well, was Al-Farabi (circa. 870-950CE). Al-Farabi makes mention of a great deal of Plato’s works, and provides commentary upon many of them, especially on Plato’s political thought (Plato devised this largely in his *Republic*, and Al-Farabi set it out in his *Laws*[^18]) and on the *Timaeus*. Al-Farabi’s two major works on Plato were the *Philosophy of Plato* and *The Harmonisation of the Two Opinions of the Two Sages, Plato the Divine and Aristotle*[^19]. Al-Farabi wrote various treatises on subjects covered in the former work, and these were largely translated by Gerard of Cremona[^20] (who is mentioned in greater detail below: see ‘Alfonso X and the School of Toledo’). From these translations, the most significant of which was *The Virtuous City* (a work that draws significantly on Plato’s *Republic*), the Latin world gained a large amount of its understanding of Plato. Future Neo-Platonists were heavily influenced by these commentaries, not only within the Islamic word (Ibn Rushd wrote a commentary on Plato’s republic largely based off Al-Farabi’s work[^21]), but in the West as well.

Whilst it can certainly be argued that Al-Farabi’s Neo-Platonism formed the basis for both future Islamic and Western Neo-Platonism, this argument is somewhat limited, as whether Al-Farabi’s Neo-Platonism is accurate to the original works of Plato and whether he was influenced by an Aristotelian bias is a subject of debate. The literature generally disagrees[^22], and so it is difficult to conclude whether Al-Farabi’s influence was as profound as it is made out to be, due to the possible inaccuracies in his commentaries. We cannot, therefore, say with any confidence that Al-Farabi’s Neo-Platonism is accurate, which limits its influence on the West substantially.
</br>

### Islamic Aristotelianism

As has previously been seen, Islamic philosophers were well aware of Aristotelian doctrines, and wrote numerous commentaries on them. Among these were Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, and Al-Farabi, all of whom we are already well acquainted with. When analysing Islamic Aristotelianism, the significance of the works produced by these three scholars cannot be understated, and so they shall be the primary focus.

As the earliest thinker and the founder of Islamic philosophy, Al-Farabi shall be explored first. We have previously discussed his Neo-Platonism, and made brief mention to Aristotle. Al-Farabi’s Aristotelianism does not usually take the form in which Aristotelianism was transmitted to the West, but it forms the basis of the works of future Islamic philosophers, and is therefore worth discussing here. Al-Farabi’s division of the sciences, laid out in his *Enumeration of the Sciences* was entirely Aristotelian, and this is one of his most influential works. It was one of the few works that was translated in its original form (By Gerard of Cremona), and brought a substantial amount of new ideas to the West. The commentary by Dominicus Gundisalvi was an exemplification of this, and his own translation and subsequent critique ensured that the West received an accurate account of Al-Farabi’s philosophy[^23]. Aristotle’s logical works were also commented on by Al-Farabi, as were his *Nicomachean Ethics* and *Politics*, although Al-Farabi’s commentaries on these were not translated and were instead transmitted to future Islamic philosophers.

Ibn Sina’s Aristotelianism has already been explored to some extent, but the parts of his philosophy that impacted Theology were but a selection from his wider corpus. Ibn Sina redefined Aristotelianism in the Islamic Golden Age. Taking much inspiration from Al-Farabi before him, a vast amount of his works were translated into Latin languages, and therefore much of it survives to this day. Ibn Rushd can claim a similar significance. Ibn Sina’s most influential work, *Book of the Cure* covered a majority of Aristotelian philosophy, and its translation alone would transmit much of Aristotle’s work to the West.

In 1255, the statutes of the Parisian arts faculty declared all known works of Aristotle mandatory reading for the students. The sources of these works were the commentaries of Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd[^24]. The uptake of such knowledge can therefore be shown to have been incredibly quick, and this just goes to show that the significance of these commentaries was obvious to contemporaries, and was obvious to future generations as well. The majority of the understanding that most Aristotelian post-Islamic Golden Age western philosophers had was through the commentaries of these thinkers.  It can therefore be concluded that the Aristotelianism influence was very large indeed.

It must be stressed, however, that Islamic Aristotelianism was not the only source of Aristotelian thought. For a large part of the corpus, translation was carried out straight from the original Greek. These translations were primarily made by the aforementioned William of Moerbeke (circa. 1215-1286 CE). He translated 20 Aristotelian works, including the *Nichomachean Ethics* and the *Politics*[^25]. These translations were the primary method of reading the works in their original forms, and they pose a limitation to the influence of Islamic commentaries. However, despite this limitation, the use of these commentaries in schools and universities is evident, and so it can still be claimed with confidence that there was a significant influence on the West.

</br>

### Gerard of Cremona and the school of Toledo

Gerard of Cremona (1114-87 CE) has been referenced multiple times throughout the course of this study, and for good reason. He was the most prolific translator of Arabic works into Latin, translating a total of 71 works[^26]. Despite being Italian, he is most closely associated with the Spanish school of Toledo, the scriptorium responsible for a majority of translation in the 12th century. The growth of the Arabic-Latin translation movement was due largely to the influence of Gerard of Cremona, and it can be argued that his aforementioned translation of Al-Farabi’s *Enumeration of the Science* served as a model for the translation movement[^27]. Indeed, he was termed *dictus magister*, ‘called the master’, a similar term of endearment as Aristotle’s title, ‘The Philosopher’[^28]. 

Gerard is purported to have a followed a strict program of translation, which, when compared to Al-Farabi’s own chronological coverage of the Aristotelian corpus, can be seen to be almost identical[^29]. This program was continued by his successor at Toledo, and set a model for the translation movement in future, as indicated by the fact that future Toledan translators filled in the gaps that Gerard of Cremona had left in his translations. From this, the influence of Al-Farabi is clear, having set a course for the future Toledan translation movement. The works of Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd were also translated in great volume, and these served as important aids to the works of Al-Farabi and original Aristotelian translations.

However, Gerard of Cremona’s primary influence was on the subject of medicine. The works of Galen, of which nine were translated at Toledo[^30], are among the most influential medical sources on which medieval Western medicine would be based and built upon, and Ibn Sina’s *Canon*, which Gerard also translated, would serve as the principal text for medical training in Europe, remaining on the curriculum until the 18th Century[^31]. The reasons for Gerard of Cremona’s interest in translating these tenets of medicine primarily lie in their importance in the Arab world, and their obvious significance to the field of medicine. The School of Chartres (including William of Conches and Adelard of Bath) drew heavily on medicinal texts such as these, as well as astrological sources also translated[^32]. The translation of such works, and their widespread use, allows us to conclude that the influence of Islamic philosophy on the revival of ancient knowledge was very large.

</br>

## Conclusion

When juxtaposed, the theological impact of Islamic Philosophy and the impact on the revival of classical knowledge are similar in extent. However, the influence on the revival of knowledge can be argued to be more substantial. Whilst there was a significant impact on the development of Thomism, this was only direct when applied to the theistic doctrine. The philosophical form of Thomism and its effects only felt the influence of Islamic philosophy indirectly, and there is little, if any, evidence that the commentaries of Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd made any direct impact. This contrasts with the revival of classical knowledge, because, despite some compromised interpretations, and the role of William of Moerbeke, there is still substantial evidence that the revival of classical knowledge was directly influenced by the commentaries of prominent Islamic philosophers and their contemporaries. The explicit use of their works in future philosophy demonstrates this. It can therefore be concluded that the influence of Islamic philosophy on the West can primarily be seen in the transmission of classical knowledge to Western scholars, and its subsequent widespread use.
