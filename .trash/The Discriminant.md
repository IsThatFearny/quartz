# The Discriminant
</br>

## Quadratic Functions

Quadratic functions are just functions of the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$

Their graphs all have the same general shape called a parabola.

The roots of a quadratic are the values of $x$ where $f(x) = 0$ (i.e where the graph crosses the $x$ axis)

A quadratic function may have 0, 1 or 2 roots, which we can find out by using the discriminant.

## Using the discriminant

Remember the quadratic formula: $$x = \frac {-b ±\sqrt{ b^{2}-4ac }}{2a}$$
$b^{2}-4ac$ is called the discriminant, Δ
