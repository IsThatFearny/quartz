# Perfect Competition 15 Marker Re-Write

</br>

### Explain how, if a firm is making supernormal profit in the short term in a perfectly competitive market, they will end up making normal profit in the long term (15)

The short-run is the situation in which one factor of production is fixed, and the long-run is where all factors of production are variable. A perfectly competitive market is a market in which firms sell homogenous goods for which there are many substitutes, there is perfect information, and no barriers to entry or exit.
