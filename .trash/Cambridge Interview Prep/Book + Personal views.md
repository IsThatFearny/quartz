## The Map of Knowledge - Moller

- History of ideas/intellectual history
- Range: 100AD-1500AD (breadth study)
- Main argument: The translation movement of the Islamic Golden Age was almost solely responsible for the knowledge of ancient greek scholarship that we have today
- Limited to two specific works - Ptolemy’s *Almagest* and Euclid’s *Elements* - and the Galenic corpus. This somewhat limits the extent to which Moller’s argument is convincing, although she does make mention of other works.
- Subject to exaggeration and appeal to populism - often chooses the more exciting story rather than the plausible one, even with insubstantial evidence. Occasionally provides fictitious accounts which are not true to reality.

## The Silk Roads - Frankopan

- An attempt at a universal history, but with a specific focus on inner Asia
- Range: approx. 500BC to present day
- Main argument: Frankopan aims to shift the ‘centre of the world’ eastwards, and to promote the idea that the interactions of these societies were far more central to global affairs than western-orientated histories tend to mention
- Consistently rejects novelty thesis of globalisation - began much earlier than is often argued - borders were crossed more frequently than formerly believed
- Focuses largely on movement: of goods, slaves, armies, etc.
- Claims to be a history of the world, a claim which few histories live up to - attested to in Burrow’s *A History of Histories - this book is no exception. He fails to sufficiently mention developments further east, neglecting China - the printing press is attributed to Gutenberg.
- Mainly focuses on the Persian centre of the silk roads, despite many interesting things happening either end
- Occasional omission of important context and detail

## The Middle East - Lewis

- A general history of the middle east
- Range: Pre-christianity - present day
- <aside>Direct contrast with Frankopan, who argues in the epilogue that the conflict of present times is simply the conflict of re-birth, and that the middle east shall soon be returned to its former glory</aside>Main argument: aims to be informative rather than to present an argument, focuses on social, cultural and economic events. Some level of argument in his notion that the middle-east is caught in historically dictated patterns that are hard to get rid of.
- Very broad history, both in geography and chronology
- Gives light to pre-christian and pre-islamic events, an uncommon theme in this kind of history
- Omits muslim spain - as seen in other books, this was a very important part of the islamic world. Whilst this is perhaps not surprising - the book is about the *middle east*, the importance of muslim spain, especially in the ‘Abbasid era should at least be acknowledged
- Well-balanced, especially in the modern areas (israel-palestine)
- Lewis is a well-known authority on the topic, although is a man of his generation and has political leanings as such - these have been highly politicized. But we must put politics aside occasionally

## Revolutionary Russia - Figes

- A concise extension of *A people’s tragedy* - bitesize history
- Range: 1891-1991
- Main argument: Figes conception of the russian revolution is that it lasted until the fall of the USSR in 1991. Towards the end of the book, he makes the argument that the collapse was caused by intellectual reforms introduced by gorbachev, *glasnost* and *perestroika*
- Division of 1917-91 into three generations: Old Bolsheviks, Stalinist, and Krushchev and beyond
- Argues that 1918 was the final chance to redeem the revolution - after this, it was irredeemable. I personally disagree: whilst it got far worse under Stalin, the state was not entirely broken, and there was always a possibility of redemption. Gorbachev simply came too late.
- The final years are perhaps misrepresented - Figes makes an attempt at finding idealism within them, when it could instead be argued that the USSR was decaying and barely hanging on to the preservation of the status quo to prevent further decay
- Figes is of course one of the leading authorities on the subject, and his adherence to correct evidence and factual information is commendable

## A People’s Tragedy - Figes

- Figes’ magnum opus, approx. 1000 pages long - a tough read!
- Range: 1891-1924
- Main argument: It was nigh on impossible for Russia to establish a new society from the ruins of Tsarism
- The logic of this is perhaps flawed: Figes argues that the common people were makers of their own destiny, and that the ‘people’s tragedy’ that he so frequently references was partly of their own making; but surely it is no fault of their own that they were subject to autocratic tsarist rule which had repressed them
- Figes tells the story from varying perspectives. He includes the views of well known figures such as Prince Lvov, Brusilov, and Gorky, but also delves into the insights from the commonality: Dmitrii Oskin, Kanatchikov, and Sergei Semenov, to name but a few. Whilst varying perspectives can contribute to a narrative, as in Tolstoy’s war and peace (over 500 characters, all somehow interconnected, and no clear pro/antagonist), it is my opinion that this universal insight does not foster a convincing argument - social history is important of course, but it is the political history that will help us understand the russian revolution in greater detail. Political and economic history makes clear the reasons behind failed revolutions without unnecessary insight from peasants and the common folk.
- Stronger, more well-known figures tend to come through stronger, whereas those who were less influential remain somewhat mystical
- Figes’ focus on individuals leaves little room for discussion of ideology or ideas - his concept of Lenin is almost distinct from Leninist ideology
- Figes’ interpretation is largely influenced by that of Gorky, who he seems to personally identify with - this is exemplified by his view of the peasantry as independent agents
- His view of the peasants as violent and ignorant is perhaps unfair, considering that their opportunities were greatly limited

## The Downing Street Years - Thatcher

- Thatcher’s memoir. A comprehensive account of her time in office. Primary source
- Range: 1979-1990
- Main argument: As might be expected, pro-maggie!
- Thatcher sets out her ideology and the influences on which it rests. Such testament by the woman herself is difficult to interpret in a different way to her own interpretation
- Because this book is a primary source, it cannot be said to be entirely trustworthy - it is what Thatcher wants us to remember, to read about. The negatives of her tenure are glossed over, and if mentioned are rapidly knocked down with an account of the triumph that succeeded the event.
- In character, Thatcher never once suggests a change of mind. She is fiercely protective of her policies and of herself, in true Iron Lady fashion
- The context provided within the book is highly informative and useful, with little bias
- Thatcher specifically relishes casting scorn upon her enemies - she relishes in describing Scargill, and describes Neil Kinnock as “at best, ill-advised”
- The truth of the book is dubious. The content has been carefully selected to portray her in a positive light, as a confident, steadfast rock of the nation. We must remember that Thatcher is the lady who’s “not for turning”.

## A History of Histories - Burrow

- Historiographical history from Herodotus to the present day
- Range: 400BC-Present Day
- Main argument: No argument as such, more an encyclopaedia of historical writing
- Relatively eurocentric, an unfortunate limitation. It does not claim to be universal, but one might expect it to be
- Herodotus, Thucydides, and ancient contemporaries are given thorough treatment, but due to the sheer amount of historians post 17th century, at the beginning of the professionalisation of the field, Burrow tends to rush slightly in an attempt at a comprehensive history
- I found the various interpretations of history and its purpose intriguing… particularly:
