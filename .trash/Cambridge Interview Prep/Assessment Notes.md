# Assessment Notes

- Ensure that analytical focus is maintained - use the words in the question. Compare and contrast!
- Do not agree or disagree with any statements - this is prior knowledge and will not be marked
- Question focus at the start of paragraphs - there is a tendency to start with “Extract A states…”. Address theme of paragraph
- Ensure that every paragraph contains excerpts from both sources: cannot argue for intentional omission as we have no way of knowing
- Do not compare quotes directly, compare their analysis instead
- Avoid broad generalisations
- Ensure that there is both an introduction and a conclusion
- Avoid restatements of providence
- Conclusion must be analytical
