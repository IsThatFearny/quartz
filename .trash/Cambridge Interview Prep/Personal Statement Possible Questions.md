Violet Moller’s ‘The Map of Knowledge’ was a major turning point for me as I entered my GCSE years. In this book I discovered my curiosity for the Islamic Golden Age, going beyond the eurocentrism that is so often exhibited in popular history.

```ad-question
title: What is popular history?
color: 150, 150, 200

Popular history is a branch of historiography which aims at wide readership and popular events, and focuses on narrative and exciting detail over historical analysis

##### Is it dumbed down history?

No, popular history is simply a different form of history. It could be argued that the approach is similar to that of the chronicler, i.e. no analysis, purely narrative. Whilst it may not have the scholarly value that we may desire as historians, to the vast majority it is easily understandable and gives the public an insight into the work of the historian

From Moller’s exploration of Baghdad, Cordoba, and Toledo (among other cities) and their role in the transmission of knowledge, I realised the central role that the Arabic world played in global development. Frankopan’s ‘The Silk Roads’ and Lewis’ ‘The Middle East’ supported this realisation, and I was surprised at the limitations of my previous reading on the period.

```ad-question
title: What did said 'central role' entail?
color: 150, 150, 200

The 'central role' which the arabic world played was primarily in translation and transmission of knowledge (e.g. galen, aristotle, plato, ptolemy, etc.), as well as architectural influence, medicinal knowledge, etc.

Often, in more eurocentric histories and in popular history, we tend to imagine the early middle ages as the 'dark ages'. Whilst this misconception is slowly being broken down, I still find that my reading on the subject was previously limited to this viewpoint, as my consumption of history was thus limited.

I took particular note of the reign of Alfonso X of Castile and his scriptorium, personally characterising him as Plato’s ideal of a Philosopher-King. 
```ad-question
title: What is your understanding of the 'philosopher-king' concept?
color: 150, 150, 200

Plato proposes in his *Republic* that a 'perfect' state would be ruled by a philosopher king, who would combine intellectual and philosophical knowledge with political power and skill. In the original dialogue, Socrates defines a philosopher as a 'lover of knowledge'.


##### Why do you apply this to Alfonso X?

Alfonso X, also known as 'the wise king', 'the learned' or 'stupor mundi', encouraged translation and education in his court. Whilst of course he was not educated for 35 years prior in the ways of philosophy and politics, as Plato would have it, his embrace of intellectual culture allows us to label him as such. For example, he founded Castillian as a language, wrote an encylopaedic book of law which created the foundation not only of spanish law but of international law, and of course hired translators in his scriptorium, believeing passionately that this philosophical knowledge should not be lost, but translated from arabic into latin and thus spread. He can be labelled as a 'lover of knowledge' for this reason.

To further develop my knowledge, I chose to write my EPQ on the influence of Islamic and Arab philosophy on Christendom. Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and Ibn Rushd piqued my interest, and I detailed how their works influenced theology and philosophy in the West, as demonstrated by Aquinas’ application of Ibn Sina’s Metaphysics in his doctrine of creation and the contribution of Ibn Rushd to Latin Averroism.

```ad-question

Ibn Sina's metaphysics was a commentary on Aristotle's own work, which critiqued and added detail to the original. Aquinas' detailed commentary on Peter Lombard's *Sentences* owes much to this commentary, specifically on the 'doctrine of creation'. Aquinas' approach was radical amongst his contemporaries, and he used *Metaphysics* to argue creation began *ex nihilo*, or from nothing. Interestingly, the *Metaphysics* also played its part in causing Aquinas to adopt a form of Aristotelianism.

Following from this, Ibn Rushd's interpretation of Aristotelianism, which was at odds with the doctrine of the catholic church, caused a problem for Aquinas, and he was tasked with reconciling the two, and hence reconciling philosophy and theology, which were increasingly against each other. Ibn Rushd asserted that philosophical enquiry was superior to religious teachings, a form of 'radical aristotelianism'. Latin Averroism formed from this.

In A-Level history, the topics of Modern Britain and Tsarist and Communist Russia have inspired further reading, such as Figes’ ‘Revolutionary Russia,’ which enthused me in my current reading of ‘A People’s Tragedy,’ which I find provides a universal insight into the revolution that is reminiscent of ‘War and Peace,’ although this style does not always foster a convincing argument; and Thatcher’s memoir ‘The Downing Street Years.’ 

```ad-question
title: Explain this style, and explain why it doesn't foster a convincing argument
color: 150, 150, 200

What I mean by this is that the book's universal insight, storytelling through ordinary people, which is similar to that of war and peace with its 500+ characters and no clear main protagonist/antagonist, cannot convincingly promote a clear line of argument, due to the varied and complex nature of the relationships of its subjects. It is perhaps necessary to take more of a helicopter view of the period, rather than needlessly exploring individualistic primary sources. Whilst yes, these remain valuable, I do not believe that this style lends itself to a convincing overarching argument.

It has been intriguing to learn of the complex world of British politics in the 20th century and how this has influenced our country in the present day. The NEA, an essay on the build-up to the abolition of slavery in 1838 in the century prior led me down an interesting research path of the legal aspects of abolition, and I concluded that the Somerset case was the most important in the abolition process.

```ad-question
title: Why did you conclude this?
color: 150, 150, 200

Contrary to the views of historians such as Eric Williams, I found that the humanitarian aspect of abolition to play a major part. Rather than a lack of economic prosperity solely driving the abolition of the slave trade, a conceited effort by those such as Clarkson, Wilberforce, and of course Granville Sharp made the difference. The ability to use the somerset case as a 'test case' allowed the abolitionist society to cite precedent when arguing later cases, and it created a legal framework from which abolition could be launched. The somerset case was clearly an invaluable aspect of abolition, without which it would have never arisen.

Economics has aided me in analysing economic policies in greater detail when studying British 20th century politics and in understanding how the economics of long-distance trade helped to extend the sphere of influence of the Arab world. 


```ad-question
title: Expand on how it helped to extend the sphere of influence
color: 150, 150, 200

The Silk Roads, whilst perhaps a cliché, were invaluable when it came to trade across the world. A common language among Arab nations facilitated this, as did a rich intellectual history and a desire for middle-eastern goods. Long-distance trade also facilitated the transmission of knowledge, bringing arabic intellect into the western world for the first time.

I have applied Philosophy to my reading of historiography and particularly enjoyed reading Burrow’s ‘A History of Histories,’ which I found to be an excellent lesson in how the historian can interpret history through writing and academic discourse. The words of Thucydides, that ‘my work… was done to last forever’, particularly resonated with me as an analysis of the purpose of historical writing.

I was shortlisted for the 2023 Fitzwilliam College History Prize essay competition, and the judges highly commended me for my attention to detail and depth of analysis. I wrote on submarine telegraphy in the late 19th-century, a topic chosen due to its far-reaching implications across the globe and my interest in economics. I asked: ‘To what extent did the submarine cable change the world?’ I researched in more detail than ever before. The result was an essay which emphasised the significant impact that the submarine cable made on the development of globalisation, diplomacy, and warfare. I concluded that submarine telegraphy was a cornerstone of the early stages of globalisation, significantly accelerating the process, and that it was invaluable in diplomacy and communication in warfare at the time. Following this research, I took a greater interest in economic history, particularly in relation to the development of globalisation.

The historian should enjoy contrasting varying interpretations, and I enjoy public speaking in the form of debating. Presenting arguments in a competitive environment, specifically in Debating Association of Victoria competitions, has developed critical analysis, research skills and quick-thinking. I am a keen sailor, competing internationally, and also enjoy music, playing piano, trombone and singing.
