# SCA Redraft


~~*Whilst* Lenin and Stalin’s agricultural policies had widespread effects, it can be argued that these policies achieved their aims in terms of economics, but failed in the social aspect their social achievements were limited in comparison to economic fairings. There is also a case *to be made* for both social and economic success, *in the form of improved standards of living and greater economic growth*. However, I shall be arguing *and shall conclude* that Lenin and Stalin’s agricultural policies failed in both regards.~~

Whilst Lenin and Stalin’s agricultural policies had widespread effects, it can be argued that these policies achieved their aims in terms of economics, but their social achievements were limited in comparison to economic success. This can be judged by living standards, the extent of economic growth, and achievements in comparison to the aims set out for the policies. ~~There is also a case to be made for both social and economic success, however the limited evidence presented is easily countered by the conclusion~~ Limited economic and social success leads to the conclusion that Lenin and Stalin’s agricultural policies failed both economically and socially.


Both leaders agricultural policies saw some success in specific aspects, but *a social aspect* ~~progress~~ was not one of these. Economically, Stalin’s series of five year plans, which involved the creation of 2500 Machine Tractor Stations, achieved agricultural aims, and Lenin’s food supplies policy of May 1918 at first supplied sufficient food for urban workers, allowing production to increase substantially. This is evidence of a degree of economic success*, and demonstrates how the expansion of agricultural opportunity led to significant economic growth*. However, social success was not achieved by any means. The harvest of 1921 only produced 48% of 1913 levels, leaving peasants starved and forcing them to resort to grain hoarding. The be found guilty of this was to face an extensive sentence in the gulag, and many peasants were subject to this. *Socially, this was highly detrimental to the standards of living of the peasantry, as they were not able to feed themselves without being arrested, causing a large decline in living conditions*. Thousands of arrests were made, brutally enforced by the Cheka. Socially, this led to further famine, as the terror regime caused people to fear the consequences of hoarding. *This led to a state of affairs in which all members of the peasantry were suspicious of others, accusing them of being Kulaks out of fear of their own accusation* Stalin’s policy of collectivisation was also a social failure - only 20% of households remained collectivised by October 1930, despite that figure having previously been at 58% in March of the same year. Collectivisation had failed to catch on, and By Stalin’s own measure of success (25% of households collectivised by the end of 1930), he had failed. As it stands, this argument is valid, but further arguments will bring this into question.

Another point that can be made is that Lenin and Stalin’s agricultural policies were a success in both aspects, economic and social. Economic benefits have already been previously stated: urban workers were, at first, provided with sufficient food; 2500 Machine Tractor Stations were built; the economic success seems to seems to be sound. Social success was also present but private markets were still involved in the economy. Private markets flourished, accounting for 52% of vegetables, 70% of meat, and 71% of milk sales. The revenues collected from these sales allowed peasants to better themselves, and to improve their standard of living (this being a vital indicator of social welfare). For a short time too, collectivisation was a success: 58% of households collectivised by March 1930 (although this is rather limited, as it was due to forced collectivisation). Lenin and Stalin’s agricultural policies had elements of success both economically and socially.

However, the argument must be made that the original view is invalid: not only were agricultural policies a social failure, they also failed economically, and so were a failure outright. Socially, evidence of failure is rife: only 20% of households remained collectivised by October 1930 following a return to voluntary collectivisation. Stalin’s target of 25% had not been met, a clear failure in policy’ the policy of dekulakisation, an attempt to make the agricultural sector more socialist and less competitive, ended up remove 10,000,000 of the best farmers, which stunted agriculutral growth - another failure; and from 1932-33, Russia experienced the worst famines history. And this failure was not limited to hindsight: 100,000 red army troops had to be sent to put down a series of revolts in the Tambov region in 1920. The peasants were experiencing firsthand the effects of the social failure of agricultural policy, and were displeased about it. Economic success was only partially existent. Despite small gains being made, agriculture had failed to make much progress since Tsarist times. In Spring 1918, there was a grain crisis, and later in the period the citizens of Petrograd subsisted on a mere 50g of bread per day. The scissors crisis of 1923 exemplified agricultural failure: industrial prices soared, whereas agricultural prices remained very low. Further, approximately 30% of cattle, pigs, and sheep were slaughtered in 1929-30, causing a livestock crisis (these animals were slaughtered for fear of the ‘kulak’ label). From these facts, it is evident that the agricultural sector was stagnating, and Lenin and Stalin’s policies aiming to improve the economic and social condition of Russia had well and truly failed altogether.

Low levels of collectivisation, famine, and outcry characterised the consequences of Lenin and Stalin’s agricultural policy. Economically, the consequences were overwhelmingly negative, despite the potential for success. The same applies socially. This failure was driven home, especially to Lenin, by the rebellion of 30,000 Kronstadt failure, loyal supporters of the October revolution - this was “the flash that lit up reality better than anything else”. Under Stalin, 40 million died in famine and through the brutality of requisitioning squads and dekulakisation patrols. Thus, it can be concluded that the agricultural policies of Lenin and Stalin from 1917-41 were an economic and social failure, and in turn, this illustrates that the view presented is wholly invalid.
