# History NEA Interpretations

Eric Williams in his 1944 book[^1] *Capitalism and Slavery* posits that the most important turning point in the struggle for abolition was American independence in 1783. His interpretation is that the loss of the North American colonies following the war of independence significantly devalued the Caribbean islands for the British, and it was due to purely economic forces that the slave trade was abolished - it had simply become unprofitable. Williams argues that the slave trade was the victim of “mature industrial capitalism”[^2].

There are certainly some merits in this interpretation. Williams is correct to say that there was an economic decline resulting from the slave trade subsequent to the loss of the 13 colonies in 1983[^3], and this certainly played some part in the abolition of the slave trade (see above), although the effects were more delayed than he asserts[^4]. He does, however, place too much emphasis on this viewpoint, and whilst he does not ignore the humanitarian aspect of abolition altogether, the reader of *Capitalism and Slavery* feels that they only get a cursory glance at most into this multifaceted subject. Williams attempts to keep his reader convinced that the economics of the slave were the primary reason for its downfall, and in doing this limits himself to a black-and-white viewpoint.

Williams tends to make sweeping, unsubstantiated statements in order to support his view: at one point, he argues that prior to 1773, “all classes in English society presented a united front with regard to the slave trade”[^5], and also asserts that “the ‘horrors’ of the Middle Passage have been exaggerated”[^6]. The former statement can be easily debunked: the existence of the Clapham sect, the early quaker movement, and the words of Lord Mansfield (see above) can all be used as counter-evidence; and the latter’s error is made clear through documented slave mortality rates on these voyages (whilst mortality did decrease to just over 5% in the 1790s[^7], prior to this it had been approximately 16%[^8]) - the Middle Passage was as hellish as it comes. 

Williams’ interpretation is also subject to external influences. He admitted himself that he owed much to the ideas of Lowell Ragatz, specifically his book *The Fall of the Planter class in the British Caribbean*[^9], itself a flawed work (Ragatz’ economic statistics were incorrect, and his implication that the prosperity of the colonies correlated directly with parliamentary interest has since been criticised heavily)[^10]. Further, his Oxford education was a major contributor to his viewpoint: his tutor, Sir Reginald Coupland, held markedly ‘whiggish’ views on the British empire and abolition, proposing that the entire conquest of empire was a benevolent one. Having personally experienced the consequences of slavery in his youth living in Trinidad and Tobago, a former slave colony, Williams found this view repulsive, arguing that the humanitarian aspect of abolition was "seriously misunderstood and grossly exaggerated by men who have sacrificed scholarship to sentimentality and, like the scholastics of old, placed faith before reason and evidence”[^11] Coupland’s focus on humanitarianism (a viewpoint founded in order to support the wider whig interpretation) turned Williams away from whig history and towards his focus on economic factors, which in turn caused his narrow view of the subject. Williams was also heavily influenced by the writings of Marx, and his notion that social developments are intrinsically linked to economic developments is inherently marxist. Such external influence creates an interpretation that is not entirely Williams’ own, and stemmed from a rebellion against the status quo of his contemporaries.

Ernest Howse’s interpretation in *Saints in Politics*, published in 1951, has a very different view of the topic to Williams. As the title suggests, Howse’s view that it was the efforts of religiously-motivated abolitionists that was the main driving force behind abolition. He specifically identifies the establishment of the Clapham Sect in 1780 as a turning point in the struggle for abolition.

Howse presents a highly plausible interpretation. The Clapham Sect’s membership included such prominent names as Wilberforce, Clarkson, and Granville Sharp, among others, all of whom are known to have had a significant impact upon the abolition of slavery: Wilberforce as the parliamentarian promoter of abolition, Clarkson as a leader of the movement, Sharp as the legal tactician. Their importance is agreed upon across the field of study[^12]. This consensus gives Howse’s interpretation significant credibility.

Howse’s background was as a pastor and a minister, and later 21st moderator of the United Church of Canada. As such, his motivation for writing *Saints in Politics* comes from a place of a deep devotion to Christianity. This influenced his focus on the religious aspect of religion, and in a similar way to Williams, Howse’s interpretation is relatively narrow. This is not necessarily damning - the view retains merit as a well-researched and thorough account - but it is argued by commentators that “secularists may find less to praise in the Rev. Dr. Howse's book than those with religious sympathies”[^13]. It is, however, the opinion of certain reviewers that Howse remained unbiased during his authorship - Curtis argues that he gives the Claphamites “only the credit which they justly and rightfully deserve”[^14]. It is the opinion of this author that Howse indeed provides an unbiased and comprehensive account of the deeds of the Clapham Sect, and does not allow what may well have become a religious myopia to distract him from a truthful exposition. 

A major criticism of Howse’s view (though not a direct response) is that the Clapham Sect and the wider community of Evangelical Christians inflated the value of William Wilberforce’s contributions, and claimed that the success of leading abolitionists could be attributed to their belief in the holy trinity[^15]. Indeed, Wilberforce wrote little on abolition outside of parliamentary contribution[^16]. Howse may perhaps also be criticised for his lack of documentation and citation[^17], however his views are mostly accurate and widely agreed upon in the general consensus.

Howse’s interpretation is widely sound, relatively free of the bias that might be expected of such a devoted Christian, and agreed upon by many leading academics in the field.
