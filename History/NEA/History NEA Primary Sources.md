This extract is by all accounts[^1] a verbatim recounting[^2] of Lord Mansfield’s concluding remarks and ruling in the Somerset case. It was the case at this time that court records were not kept, and any preservation of rulings were documented by those present. This source is one such example: Capel Lofft, a lawyer and a barrister, was present at the trial, and documented Mansfield’s words. The source is contemporary to the Somerset case, and this adds value to it: the source is less likely to have been manipulated after its publication, and therefore it is more trustworthy and can be said to be generally accurate. The fact that this record is one of the sole surviving testaments to the Somerset ruling gives it intrinsic value to the historian, as without it we would not be able to corroborate the findings of the court, and thus our study of the abolition of slavery would be greatly hindered. The purpose of the source is twofold: Mansfield’s purpose is to provide his reasoning behind the verdict - this is of value to the historian because it demonstrates Mansfield’s attitude to slavery, and the reasoning behind the verdict, which is the very same reasoning that would be used in subsequent cases; Lofft’s purpose is to inform the general reader of the outcome of the Somerset case, and primarily to preserve it for posterity for use in case law. This adds significant value to the source because, in the interest of accurate preservation and information, Lofft is highly likely to have provided an accurate record of the ruling, and to have included comprehensive detail: indeed, he himself stated that "you will find the judgments exact in form, the reasons and principles entire, their force, dependence, and connexion preserved"[^4]. He is, by his own admittance, perhaps prone to error, but he argues that “if he erred in reporting, it was on the side of inclusiveness rather than abbreviation; that he often tried to report verbatim in the interests of verisimilitude”[^5]. As stated previously, the intended audience is primarily those who would refer to it for use as precedent. The thrust of the source, from the perspective of Lord Mansfield, is that slavery is morally wrong, and can only be upheld by previously existing legislation, and under case law, Mansfield believes that the statute cannot be upheld. This is of large value to the historian, because Mansfield’s view on slavery would be used as precedent in future cases, and the interpretation of this thrust was the main factor in the outcome of these cases. The tone also adds value in a similar way: Mansfield’s condemnation of slavery as “odious” and his appeal to morality make his interpretation of the law very hostile to slavery, which would go on to influence future cases. Thus, we can conclude that this source is of value to the historian, due to the high likelihood of historical accuracy, and it being one of the very few primary accounts that exist of Mansfield’s ruling. It is also valuable because it relays the thoughts and attitudes of Mansfield himself, which would be used as precedent in future verdicts on similar cases. However, it does have limitations: Lofft’s interpretation cannot conclusively be said to be the correct one - it is argued that we will never truly know what Mansfield said. Additionally, the book in which the account appears was published 44 years later, and this leaves some room for bias or inaccuracy. Peer review of Howell’s work and comparison with the few other accounts of the case allow us to conclude that the source is mostly of sound accuracy, but the fact that the book was published in 1816, during a period of popular abolitionist sentiment raises doubts over whether it was doctored to pander to abolitionist sympathies[^3]. Therefore, whilst there is evidence to show that the source is largely useful to the historian, its limitations in terms of accuracy leave room for doubt over its value.

#### Notes

- Too focused on origin of the source
- Cut down source - perhaps first half?
- Purpose? Why did Capel Lofft record it and why is it therefore valuable?
- Summary sentence
- More limitations? Publishing date as opposed to abolition of slavery?

> “Let us ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy our work; let us allow our neighbours to breathe in peace; may they live quietly under the laws that they have made for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary firebrands, declare ourselves the lawgivers of the Caribbean, nor let our glory consist in troubling the peace of the neighbouring islands. Unlike that which we inhabit, theirs has not been drenched in the innocent blood of its inhabitants; they have no vengeance to claim from the authority that protects them.”

> A selection from The Haitian Declaration of Independence [January 1804]

</br>


This is a selection from the Haitian Declaration of Independence, as proclaimed by Jean-Jacques Dessalines (‘The Commander in Chief to the People of Haiti’). Proclaimed on January 1st 1804, the beginning of “the first year of independence” [see Appendix A], it was written approximately a month and a half after the final battle of the Haitian Revolution[^6]. This origin is of great value to the historian, in part because of its proximity to the events of the St Domingue slave revolt, and also partly because of its association with Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who was the leader of the revolt. This means that the historian is able to gain an insight into the perspective of a revolutionary, and analyse the reasoning behind the actions undertaken during the revolt. The purpose of the source is to warn the Haitian population against spreading their revolution to the surrounding peaceful islands, which do not have reason to rise. This purpose adds value for the Historian in their study of the Haitian revolution as a factor for the abolition of slavery because it shows that Dessalines did not want to become involved in conflict with other European-controlled colonies. This is of significance, especially in terms of British hesitance to intervene, because it demonstrates the reluctance on the part of both sides to enter into conflict to preserve their own interests; and it shows the animosity that the former slaves had towards France: indeed, later in the declaration, Dessalines declares “Anathema to the French name! Eternal hatred of France!” [Appendix A]. Whilst Dessalines says that “they have no vengeance to claim from the authority that protects them”, this is a relatively baseless claim (the treatment of slaves under British control was little better than the treatment of slaves by the French), and so we can infer that the sentiment would be somewhat similar in British colonies.  This is a limitation of the source - it is an obvious lie that can be disproven by evidence of poor treatment on other islands, and this falsity brings the truth of the whole source into doubt. The thrust of the extract is the same as, and serves a similar role to the purpose: encouraging the newly freed slaves to allow the revolution to remain limited to their island. The tone of the source is rather conciliatory, which is a contrast to the rest of the text [Appendix A]. Using phrases such as “let them live quietly” and “breath in peace” supports this tone, and this is of value to the historian because, again, it shows Dessalines’ insistence that the neighbours of Haiti have done no wrong and his willingness to maintain good diplomatic relations with these colonies. In summary, the source is largely of value to the historian, despite its limitation in accuracy - it is likely that Dessalines said this to prevent the revolution spreading, and so it can be excused to an extent.

> Minutes of the London Yearly Meeting, as transcribed from Fig. 1 [See Appendix A]

This source is taken from the recorded minutes of the London Yearly Meeting 1727, an annual meeting of Quakers. The meeting is responding to a correspondence from another meeting in Pennsylvania, who had formally condemned slavery. The origin of this source is of value to the historian studying turning points in the leadup to the abolition of slavery because of its relatively early date: fifty years before the Mansfield ruling, this source is the first instance of a major British religious movement formally rebuking the transatlantic slave trade. The author of this source is unknown - all that can be discovered about them is that they were an influential quaker (this can be inferred from their position in the London Yearly Meeting). This somewhat reduces credibility and value to the historian studying the religious aspect of the abolition of slavery, although knowing the religious denomination of the individual mitigates this to a certain extent. Likewise, the fact that this was published in the minutes of the meeting implies that it is the official stance of the Quaker movement, thus mitigating the otherwise dubious credibility of the source. The purpose is to inform the wider Quaker movement about the position of the Meeting. This is of value to the historian because the purpose means that the statement is likely to be well-thought out and detailed, giving the historian a better view of the position of the Meeting. The intended audience is the wider quaker movement. The intended audience and the purpose cause limitations to arise however: the limited intended transmission of this view means that there is a possibility that it is not formatted for wider consumption - i.e. it is intended to appeal solely to other Quakers rather than the general public. The thrust of the source is that the practise of slavery is “not a Commendable nor Allowed practise”. The implication that the official stance of the Quaker movement in 1727 was abolitionist is of significant value to the historian, because it demonstrates an early precedent for opposition towards slavery in religious circles - this counters the claims of some historians who seek to argue that there was no opposition in British society (See the evaluation of Eric Williams’ *Capitalism and Slavery*). Furthermore, the wide distribution of this condemnation and censure, as attested to by the statement that “this Minute is ordered to be sen by Benjamin Bealing to Friends in the Plantations abroad, as well as to the Several Quarterly Meetings at home”, is also of value to the historian, as it demonstrates the widespread influence of the quakers, which allows the historian to understand the influence of religion on abolition. In sum, the source is largely of value: it demonstrates the widespread influence of the Quaker movement, their official position on slavery, and that there was opposition to slavery even in the early 18th century. It is, however, limited to an extent, due to unknown precise authorship (and therefore lack of knowledge about bias or political tendencies), and due to the intended audience being limited to the Quaker movement, which means that wider influence was small.

### Source 4

> ![[History NEA Primary Sources#24 July Division Record|24 July Division Record]]

The nature of this source is a parliamentary division record. Its origin is Hansard, the record-keeping system of parliament, and the debate which it records occurred on 24 July 1833. This is of value to the historian studying the turning points behind the abolition of slavery because of its close proximity to the abolition act of 1833 - indeed, the debate from which it is sourced is a debate on the very act which the historian is studying. The purpose of this source is to provide a voting record on the issue at hand, specifically recording the votes against the motion, namely “that the House resolve itself into Committee on the Abolition of Slavery Bill”.[^8] This is of significant value to the historian, especially when analysing the impact of the Great Reform Act of 1832, because it allows the historian to analyse the impact of newly enfranchised constituencies and the increased accountability which MPs had to their constituency. It is important here to note that this list is of the *noes* to the motion, which in this case is, in effect, a list of abolitionist elements in this division.[^9] Of the 151 members that voted against the motion, 73 were committed to promoting immediate abolition. They were held to this pledge by their constituents, and had increased responsibility to these electors after the Great Reform Act. As well as the effects of increased responsibility, the effects of enfranchisement can also be seen in this source: when taken with five other minority (i.e. abolitionist) lists from the debate, 80% of newly enfranchised (English and Welsh) boroughs voted in line with the abolitionists, as opposed to the 51% of ‘old’ boroughs that voted in the same way.[^10] Thus, the historian studying the abolition of the slave trade can conclude that the effect of enfranchisement and increased accountability was direct and significant. The intended audience of this source ties in with the accountability aspect of the Great Reform Act: the audience of this voting record was the constituents which these members represented, and as a publicly accessible document, available to those with newfound power to hold MPs to account, this demonstrates to the historian that the effects of the Great Reform Act were to increase accountability, and thus that it was a major factor in the abolition of slavery.

### Lord Mansfield’s ruling in the Somerset case, as reported by Capell Lofft in Lofft 1, 98 Eng. Rep. 499 (K.B. 1772), as reprinted in T.B. Howell, A Complete Collection of State Trials Vol. XX, 1816. pg. 82

“On the part of Sommersett, the case which we gave notice should be decided this day, the Court now proceeds to give its opinion. I shall recite the return to the writ of Habeas Corpus, as the ground of our determination; omitting only words of form. The captain of the ship on board of which the negro was taken, makes his return to the writ in terms signifying that there have been, and still are, slaves to a great number in Africa; and that the trade in them is authorized by the laws and opinions of Virginia and Jamaica; that they are goods and chattels; and, as such, saleable and sold. That James Sommersett is a negro of Africa, and long before the return of the king's writ was brought to be sold, and was sold to Charles Steuart, esq. then in Jamaica, and has not been manumitted since; that Mr. Steuart, having occasion to transact business, came over hither, with an intention to return; and brought Sommersett to attend and abide with him, and to carry him back as soon as the business should be transacted. That such intention has been, and still continues; and that the negro did remain till the time of his departure in the service of his master Mr. Steuart, and quitted it without his consent; and thereupon, before the return of the king's writ, the said Charles Steuart did commit the slave on board the Anne and Mary, to safe custody, to be kept till he should set sail, and then to be taken with him to Jamaica, and there sold as a slave. And this is the cause why he, captain Knowles, who was then and now is, commander of the above vessel, then and now lying in the river of Thames, did the said negro, committed to his custody, detain; and on which he now renders him to the orders of the Court. We pay all due attention to the opinion of sir Philip Yorke, and Lord chancellor Talbot, whereby they pledged themselves to the British planters, for all the legal consequences of slaves coming over to this kingdom or being baptized, recognized by Lord Hardwicke, sitting as chancellor on the 19th of October, 1749, that trover would lie: that a notion had prevailed, if a negro came over, or became a Christian, he was emancipated, but no ground in law that he and Lord Talbot, when attorney and solicitor general, were of opinion, that no such claim for freedom was valid; that though the statute of tenures had abolished villeins regardant to a manor, yet he did not conceive but that a man might still become a villein in gross, by confessing himself such in open court. We are so well agreed, that we think there is no occasion of having it argued (as I intimated an intention at first) before all the judges, as is usual, for obvious reasons, on a return to a Habeas Corpus. The only question before us is, whether the cause on the return is sufficient? If it is, the negro must be remanded; if it is not, he must be discharged. Accordingly, the return states, that the slave departed and refused to serve; whereupon he was kept, to be sold abroad. So high an act of dominion must be recognized by the law of the country where it is used. The power of a master over his slave has been extremely different, in different countries. The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory. It is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from the decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.”

### The Haitian Declaration of Independence [January 1804]

“The Commander in Chief to the People of Haiti 

Citizens:
It is not enough to have expelled the barbarians who have bloodied our land for two centuries; it is not enough to have restrained those ever-evolving factions that one after another mocked the spectre of liberty that France dangled before you. We must, with one last act of national authority, forever assure the empire of liberty in the country of our birth; we must take any hope of re-enslaving us away from the inhuman government that for so long kept us in the most humiliating torpor. In the end we must live independent or die. 

Independence or death... let these sacred words unite us and be the signal of battle and of our reunion. 

Citizens, my countrymen, on this solemn day I have brought together those courageous soldiers who, as liberty lay dying, spilled their blood to save it; these generals who have guided your efforts against tyranny have not yet done enough for your happiness; the French name still haunts our land… 

…We have dared to be free, let us be thus by ourselves and for ourselves. Let us imitate the grown child: his own weight breaks the boundary that has become an obstacle to him. What people fought for us? What people wanted to gather the fruits of our labour? And what dishonourable absurdity to conquer in order to be enslaved. Enslaved?... Let us leave this description for the French; they have conquered but are no longer free. 

Let us walk down another path; let us imitate those people who, extending their concern into the future, and dreading to leave an example of cowardice for posterity, preferred to be exterminated rather than lose their place as one of the world's free peoples. 

Let us ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy our work; let us allow our neighbours to breathe in peace; may they live quietly under the laws that they have made for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary firebrands, declare ourselves the lawgivers of the Caribbean, nor let our glory consist in troubling the peace of the neighbouring islands. Unlike that which we inhabit, theirs has not been drenched in the innocent blood of its inhabitants; they have no vengeance to claim from the authority that protects them. 

Fortunate to have never known the ideals that have destroyed us, they can only have good wishes for our prosperity.

Peace to our neighbours; but let this be our cry: "Anathema to the French name! Eternal hatred of France!" 

Natives of Haiti! My happy fate was to be one day the sentinel who would watch over the idol to which you sacrifice; I have watched, sometimes fighting alone, and if I have been so fortunate as to return to your hands the sacred trust you confided to me, know that it is now your task to preserve it. In fighting for your liberty, I was working for my own happiness. Before consolidating it with laws that will guarantee your free individuality, your leaders, who I have assembled here, and I, owe you the final proof of our devotion.

Generals and you, leaders, collected here close to me for the good of our land, the day has come, the day which must make our glory, our independence, eternal.

If there could exist among us a lukewarm heart, let him distance himself and tremble to take the oath which must unite us. Let us vow to ourselves, to posterity, to the entire universe, to forever renounce France, and to die rather than live under its domination; to fight until our last breath for the independence of our country.

And you, a people so long without good fortune, witness to the oath we take, remember that I counted on your constancy and courage when I threw myself into the career of liberty to fight the despotism and tyranny you had struggled against for 14 years. Remember that I sacrificed everything to rally to your defence; family, children, fortune, and now I am rich only with your liberty; my name has become a horror to all those who want slavery. Despots and tyrants curse the day that I was born. If ever you refused or grumbled while receiving those laws that the spirit guarding your fate dictates to me for your own good, you would deserve the fate of an ungrateful people. But I reject that awful idea; you will sustain the liberty that you cherish and support the leader who commands you. Therefore vow before me to live free and independent, and to prefer death to anything that will try to place you back in chains. Swear, finally, to pursue forever the traitors and enemies of your independence.

Done at the headquarters of Gonaives, the first day of January 1804, the first year of independence.”
