# History NEA Combined Essay

</br>



The opinion that Lord Mansfield's ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case of 1772 was a key turning point in the struggle to abolish slavery in the British Empire has long been a contentious issue amongst Historians.  There have been several other turning points that many consider to be the most significant, including the American Revolution of 1783, the introduction of the 1806 Foreign Slave Trade Act, and the introduction of positive law in the form of the 1832 Great Reform Act. Eric Williams argues that the American Revolution of 1783 was the most critical turning point, with the driving force behind abolition being entirely economic; a similar argument can be made for the 1806 Foreign Trade Act. The humanitarian aspect of abolition is presented by Howse. He makes a strong case for the formation of religiously-influenced movements representing the most decisive turning point. Considering all of the aforementioned turning points, this essay will conclude that the Great Reform Act of 1832 was in fact the most significant turning point in the struggle for the abolition of slavery in 1838.

Written in 1939 as a doctoral thesis, and published in 1944, Eric Williams’ *Capitalism and Slavery* posits that the most critical turning point in the struggle for abolition was American independence in 1783.[^1] His interpretation is that loss of the North American colonies following the War of Independence significantly devalued the Caribbean islands for the British, and it was purely economic forces that led to the abolition of the slave trade - it had simply become unprofitable. Williams argues that the slave trade was the victim of “mature industrial capitalism”.[^2] Indeed, as Drescher explains, Britain’s mercantilist policy was undermined and the colonies failed to sustain their assigned role as producers and customers.[^3] Williams suggests that this was the catalyst for decline in profitability of the slave trade, and that this decline is the principle motivation for abolition. Williams’ reasoning, however, is subject to external influences: he admits for example, that many of his ideas can be attributed to the work of Lowell Ragatz, specifically in his book *The Fall of the Planter class in the British Caribbean*.[^4] Williams’ Oxford education was also a major influence: his tutor, Sir Reginald Coupland, held markedly ‘whiggish’ views on the British Empire and abolition. Coupland proposed that the conquest of Empire was benevolent. With personal experience of slavery’s consequences growing up in Trinidad and Tobago, a former slave colony, Williams found Coupland’s view repulsive, stating that the humanitarian aspect of abolition was "seriously misunderstood and grossly exaggerated by men who have sacrificed scholarship to sentimentality”.[^5] Williams was also heavily influenced by the writings of Marx, his education of Marxist views stemming from his Trinidadian teacher, and Williams’ notion that social developments are intrinsically linked to economic developments is inherently Marxist.[^6] Williams is known to have reserved stinging criticism for historians who ignored Britain’s perpetuation of slavery, and free-market economists who encouraged capitalism.[^7] Such external influence resulting in large prejudices creates an interpretation that is not entirely Williams’ own: a rebellion against the status quo. Historians agree that there are some merits in Williams’ interpretation: there was, for example, an economic decline subsequent to the loss of the 13 colonies in 1983, and this certainly played some part in the abolition of the slave trade. Ryden, however, postulates that the effects were more delayed than Williams' asserts.[^8] It is argued by many that he places too much emphasis on this factor, and whilst he does not completely ignore the humanitarian aspect of abolition, the reader feels that Williams’ insight is cursory and polarised.[^9] Anstey supports this by highlighting Williams’ tendency to make sweeping, unsubstantiated statements in order to support his view.[^10] His argument that, prior to 1773, “all classes in English society presented a united front with regard to the slave trade”, and also that “the ‘horrors’ of the Middle Passage have been exaggerated” are clear examples of this.[^11] The former statement has since been debunked by Drescher, and the existence of the Clapham Sect, the early Quaker movement, and the words of Lord Mansfield can all be used as counter-evidence;[^12] the latter’s error is made clear through documented slave mortality rates on these voyages (whilst mortality decreased to just over 5% in the 1790s, prior to this it had been approximately 16%) - the Middle Passage was as hellish as it comes.[^13]  Williams’ interpretation of the most influential turning point was largely biased by personal and political tendencies, and a relatively limited scope. This not only serves to point out flaws in Williams’ own interpretation, but also debases the argument from economic viability.

Ernest Howse’s interpretation in *Saints in Politics*, published in 1951, demonstrates disparate views in comparison to Williams. As the title suggests, Howse believed the efforts of religiously-motivated abolitionists to be the primary driving force behind abolition. He specifically identifies the establishment of the Clapham Sect in 1780 as a turning point. The Clapham Sect’s membership included prominent names, such as William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, and Granville Sharp, among others. it is renownedly considered by Historians that these members all had a significant influence on the abolition of slavery: Wilberforce as the parliamentarian promoter of abolition, Clarkson as a leader of the movement, and Sharp as the legal tactician. Their importance is agreed upon across the field of study.[^14] This consensus gives Howse’s interpretation significant credibility. Howse was as a pastor, a minister, and later the 21st moderator of the United Church of Canada.[^15] As such, his motivation as author of *Saints in Politics* is rooted in a deep devotion to Christianity, thus resulting in a focus on the religious aspect of abolition. Many reviewers believe that Howse remained unbiased during his authorship. Curtis argues that he gives the Claphamites “only the credit which they justly and rightfully deserve”.[^16] It is the opinion of this author that Howse provides an unbiased and comprehensive account of the deeds of the Clapham Sect, and does not allow what potentially may have become a religious myopia to distract him from a truthful exposition. Critics argue that, like Williams, Howse’s interpretation is narrow. This is not necessarily damning - the view retains merit as a well-researched and thorough account, however it is argued by commentators that “secularists may find less to praise in the Rev. Dr. Howse's book than those with religious sympathies”.[^17]  Another  criticism of Howse is that the Clapham Sect and the wider community of Evangelical Christians inflated the value of William Wilberforce’s contributions, and claimed that the success of leading abolitionists could be attributed to their belief in the Holy Trinity.[^18] Indeed, Wilberforce wrote little on abolition outside of parliamentary contribution.[^19] Howse may also be criticised for insufficient documentation and citation. However, his proximate views are widely agreed upon by the general consensus and his interpretation relatively free of the bias that might have been expected of such a devoted Christian.

It is widely recognised that Lord Mansfield's ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case of 1772 was a key turning point in the process of abolishing slavery. Unlike previous cases, *Somerset* was interpreted as the finale to the ending of in Britain, and some suggested that *Somerset* could also be the basis for the abolition of slavery in the British colonies too, based upon the notion that the laws of England travelled with Englishmen, and thus the law could be applied in any British settlements.[^20] It set a legal precedent whereby a master was not only prevented from removing a slave from the country without the slave’s consent, but in addition the slave could secure a writ of *habeus corpus* to prevent removal.[^21] The Somerset case had multiple precursors: Butts Vs Penny, Chamberlain Vs Harvey, Smith Vs Brown and Cooper, and R Vs Stapylton.[^22] The cases of Chamberlain Vs Harvey and Smith Vs Brown and Cooper, presided over by Chief Justice Sir John Holt, are considered direct predecessors to *Somerset*. In Smith Vs Brown and Cooper, Holt ruled that "as soon as a negro comes into England, he becomes free; one may be a villein in England, but not a slave".[^23] Despite this significant judgement, the case did not lead to immediate abolition. Holt proceeded to establish a legal mechanism for selling slaves in Britain based upon unofficial advice to the claimant.[^24] Similarly, the court’s decision in Chamberlain vs Harvey was that a slave could not be treated as chattel, but was still a "bound apprentice”.[^25] Therefore, whilst these rulings had significant weight, their impact was not as pivotal as *Somerset*. Mansfield’s ruling is considered such a momentous turning point as whilst technically Mansfield only ruled on specific aspects of the law as mentioned previously, the ruling was seen by many contemporaries as effectively the abolition of slavery in Britain.[^26] Indeed, in an unreported case from 1773, the presiding judge concluded that *Somerset* meant that slavery had never been legitimate in Britain, and one Scottish case strongly implied that the effects of *Somerset* would be widespread.[^27] This evaluation of Mansfield’s ruling arose from overenthusiastic counsel and judges who misinterpreted the ruling.[^28] It was this interpretation and its future consequences that influenced the views of many who were committed to abolition (in the wake of the 1832 Great Reform Act) in Parliament. Mansfield's ruling certainly seems to imply that this was his view. The source detailing Mansfield’s ruling (Appendix A) is (by all accounts) a verbatim transcription of Lord Mansfield’s concluding remarks and ruling on *Somerset*.[^29] At this time, court records were not kept, and any preservation of rulings were only documented by those present. This source is one such example: Capel Lofft, a lawyer and barrister, was present at the trial, and documented Mansfield’s words. The source is contemporary to *Somerset*, and is therefore valuable. This record is one of the sole surviving testaments to the Somerset ruling, which gives it intrinsic value to the historian: without it, corroboration of the court’s findings, and this study would be significantly hindered. Lofft’s purpose is to inform the general reader of the outcome of *Somerset*, to provide the reasoning behind Mansfield’s ruling, and primarily to preserve it for posterity for use in case law. This adds significant value to the source because the ruling’s preservation ties in with the largest effect of *Somerset*: the setting of precedent. Keeping this purpose in mind, it is feasible that Lofft provided an accurate record of the ruling, and to have included comprehensive detail: he declared that "you will find the judgements exact in form, the reasons and principles entire, their force, dependence, and connexion preserved".[^30] He admits that he may be prone to error, but argues that “if I erred in reporting, it was on the side of inclusiveness rather than abbreviation”.[^31] It is also valuable because it relays the thoughts and attitudes of Mansfield himself. The tone adds similar value: Mansfield’s condemnation of slavery as “odious” and his appeal to morality clearly show hostility to slavery, which would influence the tone of future cases. The thrust of the source is that slavery is morally wrong, and under case law the statute cannot be upheld. This is of great value to the historian as the interpretation of this thrust was the main factor in the outcome of subsequent cases. Thus, one can conclude that this source is of value to the historian, due to the high likelihood of accuracy, and it being one of few primary accounts that exist of Mansfield’s ruling. However, it does have limitations: Lofft’s interpretation cannot conclusively be said to be the correct one - it is argued that we will never know precisely what Mansfield said, and the fact that the book was published in 1816, 44 years later and during a period of popular abolitionist sentiment raises doubts over whether it was doctored to pander to abolitionist sympathies.[^32] Therefore, whilst there is evidence to show that the source is largely valuable to the historian, the limitation of the date of publication needs to be considered. Granville Sharp had intended to use *Somerset* as a test case to set a precedent and to effectively outlaw slavery in Britain, and the case proved its worth.[^33] As the highest judge presiding at the highest common law court in the land, Mansfield’s rulings carried significant weight. Thus, ruling that James Somerset was to go free allowed other individuals to plead their case before the courts, citing *Somerset* as precedent. Mansfield had created a legal framework which would do "as much damage to the legitimacy of the slaveowners” position as possible, short of ruling against them.[^34] Appeals to the court continued for the next century.[^35] This was consequential to the abolition of slavery in 1838 - *Somerset* reframed the debate on slavery in Britain. Mansfield’s comments on ‘positive law’ were particularly significant: it would indeed be positive law that contributed to ending (in the form of the 1832 Great Reform Act and the 1806 Foreign Slave Trade Act) and finally ended slavery in the colonies. His understanding that case law would be unable to end slavery was of much significance to the implementation of future positive laws against slavery. The importance of the Somerset case as a turning point, however, is limited, because few appeals were successful, and slaves continued to be recaptured and transported back to British colonies.[^36] Additionally, many masters evaded the ruling by forcing slaves to sign documents which would make them an ‘indentured servant’, invoking *lex loci contractus* rather than *lex loci domicilii*, which Mansfield had ruled against.[^37] Mansfield himself took opportunity to lecture the English bar on the specifics of the ruling to avoid misinterpretation.[^38] Despite its merits, these limitations cause one to conclude that *Somerset* was not the most important turning point in the struggle to abolish slavery in the British empire.

The 1806 Foreign Slave Trade Act was also a major turning point in the struggle for abolition, as it abolished two-thirds of the British slave trade, and in turn strengthened the campaign for the full abolition of the slave trade in 1807.[^3] During the War of the Fourth Coalition, fought from 1806-1807 between a multi-national coalition (including Britain) and France, it was realised by James Stephen, a prominent abolitionist, that the trade of slaves under neutral flags, especially that of the USA, was prolonging the enemy’s resistance.[^39] He explained this idea to William Wilberforce, who manifested this in a bill for the 1806 Foreign Slave Trade act. It would prohibit British subjects from trading or assisting in the trade of slaves to colonies and foreign countries.[^40] This severely affected the neutral slave trade: many ships flying under American flags were built in British shipyards, now an illegal action.[^41] The Foreign Slave Trade Act was a turning point not only because it abolished two-thirds of the slave trade, but also because it led to a different perspective on abolition, of patriotism rather than economic interest.[^42] Campaigning for abolition became patriotic, a necessity in winning the war. The 1806 act is argued to have outweighed the role of humanitarianism: Anstey claims that the humanitarian aspect was downplayed in parliamentary speeches in favour of the patriotic.[^43] The act had ramifications into the future, laying the groundwork for the 1807 Slave Trade Act - Burton goes so far as to argue that the 1806 act was more practically important than the 1807 act because of the extent of its impact - and the new attitude that the British public and parliament had on abolition would have great influence on the success of the abolition campaign in the future, both in 1807 and 1833.[^44] The argument, does, however, have a limitation. The passing of the act was not done for the purposes of abolition, but to aid in winning the war. Indeed, the only two people that seemed aware of the ramifications of the act were James Stephen, who, perhaps unsurprisingly, kept quiet; and Banastre Tarleton, an MP, representing some ship owners who would be affected by the legislation. He spoke out in the Commons, but was helpless to prevent the bill’s passage.[^45] This limitation ensured that it was difficult for the abolition movement to make progress during the passage of the bill through the Lords, for fear of the chamber voting against the bill.[^46] However, the bill did pass, and its practical implications stated above allows it to be argued that the 1806 Foreign Slave Trade Act was an important turning point in the struggle for abolition.[^47]

The role of religion in abolition cannot be understated, and a major turning point was the founding of the first anti-slavery organisation by the Quakers. The Quaker movement had previously written an anti-slavery statement in 1688 in Germantown, Pennsylvania.[^48] Records show that English Quakers began to express their disapproval and promote reforms as early as 1727, as demonstrated by a statement from the London Yearly Meeting of Quakers (Appendix A). This opinion is taken from the recorded minutes of the London Yearly Meeting 1727. The meeting is a response to a correspondence from Pennsylvania Quakers, who had formally condemned slavery.[^49] The origin of this source is of value to the historian studying turning points in the leadup to the abolition of slavery due to its relatively early date: this source is the first instance of a major British religious movement formally rebuking the Transatlantic slave trade. The author of this source is unknown - all that can be discovered about them is that they were an influential Quaker. However, the fact that this was published in the minutes of the meeting implies that it is the official stance of the Quaker movement, mitigating the otherwise dubious value of the source. The purpose is to inform the wider movement about the position of the Meeting, which is of value to the historian because it means that the statement is likely to be considered and detailed, giving the historian an improved perspective. The intended audience is the wider Quaker movement. The intended audience and the purpose cause limitations to arise however: the intended transmission of this view means that there is a possibility that it is not formatted for wider consumption. The thrust of the source is that slavery is “not a Commendable nor Allowed practise”. The implication that the official stance of the Quakers in 1727 was abolitionist is of significant value to the historian, as it demonstrates an early precedent abolition in religious circles, counterclaiming historians who seek to argue that at this point there was no opposition in British society (See the evaluation of *Capitalism and Slavery*). Furthermore, the wide geographical distribution of this condemnation, as attested to by the fact that the document was sent “to Friends in the Plantations abroad, as well as to the Several Quarterly Meetings at home”, is also of value to the historian, demonstrating the widespread influence of the Quakers. In sum, the source is largely of value. It demonstrates the widespread influence of the Quaker movement, their official position on slavery, and that there was opposition to slavery even in the early 18th century, although it is limited due to unknown authorship and that the intended audience is limited to the Quaker movement, thus preventing wider influence. Further resolutions followed in 1758, 1761, and 1783.[^50] In 1767, the Quaker movement took part in a systematic campaign for abolition, designing and printing pamphlets to distribute to MPs; in 1773, a petition was made by the Quaker movement to prevent slave trade within Virginia. The First Lord of Trade was well disposed to this idea.[^51] After the successful campaign for the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, the religious collective set their sights on the abolition of slavery as a practise. This was where religion had the most substantial impact on abolition. The network that had been gradually formed by both those of faith and those interested in abolition was vital in furthering abolitionism into the public eye, circulating anti-slavery literature, promoting the sales of memorabilia (the most famous example of which is the 'Am I not a man and a brother?' medallion), organising boycotts and lectures, and crucially, gathering signatures to append to anti-slavery petitions presented to Parliament.[^52] This network culminated in the ‘Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade’ (henceforth, ‘the Society’). The Quakers, with some Evangelical Christians, played an enormous part in the organisation and mobilisation of the Society, a cornerstone of the abolitionist campaign. Additionally, the Quaker’s enthusiasm for abolition was taken up by other religious organisations: the Clapham Sect was founded by some of those who founded the Society, and Methodists were also strongly in favour of abolition: leading up to the 1830 general election, the Methodist Conference told members to vote for abolitionist candidates.[^53] The 1727 declaration was an important turning point in itself, as were subsequent resolutions by the Quaker movement, because of the long-term reform that it brought throughout the 18th century, indirectly resulting in the abolition of slavery. The greatest consequence of Quaker influence was the influence on the views of wider society, much of which had been newly enfranchised by the 1832 Great Reform Act, and who would use this electoral power to elect those with similar views to parliament in the 1832 election. This argument is, however, limited because, as suggested by a significant lack of evidence of external action from 1727 to 1767, the Quaker movement were only interested in abolishing slavery within their own movement for the first fifty years of their activity on slavery, and so the early impact which could be inferred from the 1727 proclamation is significantly limited.[^54] Whilst the Quaker movement was certainly an important turning point, its limitations prevent one from concluding that it is the most important.

Another major turning point in the abolition of slavery was the passing of the 1832 Great Reform Act.[^55] This was the ‘positive law’ which Mansfield referenced. It served to enfranchise much of the population of Britain, creating 67 new constituencies and giving a significant proportion of the middle and upper classes the right to vote.[^56] Previously, voting had been limited to the upper classes, and the electorate had had little independence or power over their elected representatives. The Great Reform Act gave more power to an expanded electorate, and now, more than ever, would a popular cause such as abolition be influential in the electoral system.[^57] The new House of Commons contained no less than 104 MPs pledged to support the immediate emancipation of slaves.[^58] Parliamentary records lend strong support to this argument. The best example is a parliamentary division record from Hansard (Appendix A). The debate recorded occurred on 24 July 1833. This is of value to the historian studying the turning points behind the abolition of slavery because of its close proximity to the 1833 Abolition Act, only a month before the act received royal assent - indeed, the debate from which it is sourced is on the very act which the historian is studying. The source’s purpose is to provide a voting record on the issue at hand, specifically recording the votes against the motion, namely “that the House resolve itself into Committee on the Abolition of Slavery Bill”.[^59] This is of significant value to the historian, allowing them to analyse the impact of newly enfranchised constituencies and the increased accountability which MPs had to their constituency. Note here that this list is of the noes to the motion, which in this case is effectively a list of abolitionist elements in this division.[^60] Of the 151 members that voted against the motion, 73 were committed to promoting immediate abolition, held to this pledge by their constituents. As well as the effects of increased responsibility, the effects of enfranchisement are also highlighted in this source: when taken with five other minority (i.e. abolitionist) lists from the debate, 80% of newly enfranchised boroughs voted with the abolitionists; only 51% of ‘old’ boroughs voted similarly.[^61] The historian studying abolition can therefore conclude that the effect of enfranchisement and increased accountability was direct and significant. The intended audience of this source ties in with the accountability aspect of the Great Reform Act: the audience of this voting record was the electorate, and as a publicly accessible document, available to those with newly acquired power to hold MPs to account, this demonstrates to the historian that the effects of the Great Reform Act were to increase accountability. The source is limited, however, as it is simply a list of names - no tone is present and so exact attitudes towards abolition cannot be inferred. Despite this, the source can still be argued to be mostly valuable to the historian, with some caveats. Whilst there was some stalling on the part of anti-abolitionists and those who desired a compensatory solution (whereby planters would be compensated for their ‘loss’), direct lobbying of ministers ensured that the government legislated for abolition: Lord Althorp committed to introducing emancipatory measures to the House by 23 April 1833 (later postponed to 14 May).[^62] These measures would, after some debate and concessions from both sides, form the basis of the 1833 Abolition of Slavery Act. The admittance of abolitionists to Parliament ensured that abolitionists were able to promote their views and force the hand of the government. It must also be considered, however, that the pressure placed on the government was not entirely from those within Parliament. Significant external pressure was placed on Members by their constituents: after 15 April, the number of petitions received by Parliament rose to, on average, 75 per day; they had previously received no more than 150.[^63] The anti-slavery movement which existed outside of Parliament could be argued to have exerted considerably more influence. This limitation is mitigated however, as there is a strong case arguing that the Great Reform Act ensured that these petitions were heeded, because Members were subject to much greater accountability than previously. Even within the House of Lords, where pressure such as this did not exist, Henry Taylor’s assumption that they “Would shrink from the unpopularity which the rejection or essential modification of it would bring upon them” was correct.[^64] We may therefore conclude that the Great Reform Act was a major turning point in the struggle for the abolition of slavery, because without it it is likely that emancipatory measures would not have been passed due to opposition within Parliament.

In conclusion, I find the 1832 Great Reform Act to be the most important turning point in the struggle for abolition. Without its passage, the popular support for abolition would not have been represented in Parliament, nor would many Members have heeded it. This would have likely prevented the abolition of slavery for many years, even decades. Whilst the influence of the Somerset vs Stewart case in setting legal precedent, the Quaker-established abolition movement, and the 1806 Foreign Slave Trade Act were also important turning points, none had such effect on abolition as the Great Reform Act of 1832. *Somerset* is limited in the fact that it was easily circumvented, and backtracked on by Mansfield, thus limiting its effect more than contemporaries and historians have argued. The 1806 Foreign Slave Trade Act was an important turning point, as was the foundation of the abolition movement, but neither would have contributed to abolishing slavery to the same extent if the 1832 Great Reform Act had not enabled the newly elected parliament to be comprised of members who were not only more accountable to their constituents, many of whom had abolitionist tendencies, but were also more easily influenced. The Great Reform Act was the catalyst for the abolition of slavery in 1838, and Mansfield’s comment that “[slavery] is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support but positive law” was vindicated.

“The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory. It is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law.
