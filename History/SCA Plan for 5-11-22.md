# SCA Plan for 5-11-22

</br>

## Economic Prosperity (Affluent Society, etc.)

- People enjoyed a higher standard of living
- Hire-purchase made things affordable
- Automation allowed women to work (dishwashers, washing machines, etc.)
- People felt 'affluent'
- 'You've never had it so good' - Macmillan
- End of rationing in 1953, end of austerity
- Full employment
- Inflation remained below 2%
</br>

## Economic Issues

- Stop-go policies employed by the Tories. Economy would heat up with go policies and cool down again under stop policies. Sign of instability
- Compared to other western countries, low economic growth (Britain 2.5% average, compared to west Germany, 7%)
- Production much lower than competitors
- Keynes had to ask USA for a loan. The conditions of said loan damaged the sterling's convertibility (run on dollar reserves)
- Forced devaluation of the pound
- Failure to join the EEC (De gaulle's refusal... commonwealth and special relationship) had major consequences
- 6 chancellors in 13 years... instability
- Affluency was purely comparative to austerity

</br>

## Conclusion

Weaknesses outweigh strengths. Despite relative prosperity (compared to austerity), Britain was lagging behind the rest of the world in GDP, industrial production, etc. Poor economic handling by the Tories exacerbated economic issues. Unstable economy (and governmental policy) and no membership of the EEC worsened things. Purely relative affluence achieved... not 'real'
