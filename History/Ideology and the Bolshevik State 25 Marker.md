# Ideology and the Bolshevik State 25 Marker


### How important was ideology in the development of the Bolshevik state, 1917-1929?

</br>

**LOE 1:** Political events were largely driven by ideology

- Decrees on Land and Workers control were ideologically sound (dictatorship of the proletariat, equal distribution of land, etc.)
- Vanguardism (during the revolution) stemmed from Marxist-Leninist ideology
- Disenfranchisement of middle and upper classes helped to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat

**LOE 2:** Political events were largely driven by pragmatism

- Dissolution of the constituent assembly was motivated by Lenin’s desire to eliminate opposition (even more right-wing socialist opposition)
- Lenin’s testament on the leadership succession was largely pragmatic - only partly considered whether the individual was true to the ideology of the party, mainly taking into account leadership skills and temperament
- ‘Socialism in one country’ (official Bolshevik policy) was decided upon to maintain socialism in Russia, and avoid diverting resources to countries such as Germany (believed to be on the verge of revolution). Did not follow ideology (although Marx never mentioned this in his literature)
- 1921 Ban on Factions shows Lenin’s need for elimination of opposition - against Marxist ideology (Marx advocated for representative government before the ‘withering of the state’)
- State did not wither - indeed, was more centralised from 1924-28


**LOE 3:** Economic development was spurred by a pragmatic response from Bolshevik leadership

- NEP diverted from Marxist ideology, introducing ‘state capitalism’ and growing the middle class (rather than growing the working class, which would have been ideologically fitting)

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, whilst some Bolshevik political actions such as the early decrees, the use of vanguardism during the revolution, and the disenfranchisement of the middle and upper classes were indeed ideologically sound and motivated, most political decisions were made due to circumstance, such as the Ban on Factions, the dissolution of the constituent assembly, etc. The same is true for economic policy. Both were intended to preserve the power of the Bolshevik party, under the guise of preserving socialism and the Bolshevik state. It can therefore be argued that ideology was of little importance in the development of the Bolshevik state in the period 1917-29.
