### Alexander II deserves the title of “Tsar Liberator.” Assess the validity of this view.

Alexander II is often given the title of ‘Tsar Liberator’ or ‘Tsar Reformer’ in recognition of the ‘liberal’ reforms that he brought about during his reign. However, the legitimacy of this title can be questioned. This essay will explore three lines of argument: firstly, that Alexander II *does* deserve this title because of the success of emancipating the serfs; secondly, that he does not deserve this title, because his emancipatory reforms were half-hearted and generally failures; and thirdly, that he does not deserve the title, because of the failures of his various other reforms. The essay shall eventually conclude that Alexander II does not deserve the title of Tsar Liberator, because of the failures of his emancipation program.

The title ‘Tsar Liberator’ is most commonly associated with Alexander II’s emancipation of the serfs, in the form of the 1861 Emancipation Edict, and this is, to an extent, deserved. The edict aimed to free all privately owned serfs from their masters, to allocate them plots of land which they could farm for themselves, and to improve the quality of living of peasants and serfs across the country. At the time, approximately 19 million peasants in Russia were serfs, and so their emancipation had a very large effect, because they were a large proportion of the 80 million strong population. Emancipation also allowed for the rise of the new ‘kulak’ sub-class, a form of prosperous, wealthy peasant. These peasants were capable of moving beyond subsistence farming and cottage industry, and were able to produce a surplus to be sold at local markets. In the case of Kulaks, Alexander II certainly deserves the title of Tsar Liberator, because he substantially improved their quality of life. He also can be said to have improved the quality of life for less prosperous peasants, who were now able to move away from the landlord to whom they had previously been tied, allowing for greater mobilisation and opportunity. Some went to urban areas and began to work in factories, earning significantly higher wages and not relying on subsistence farming for their livelihood. It is evident that Alexander II saw some success in emancipation, and therefore can lay claim to the title of Tsar Liberator.

However, the emancipation edict has been argued to have been more of a failure than it was a success, and this shows that Alexander II was perhaps not the liberator that we might have hoped him to be. Whilst private serfs were freed, there were major caveats to the edict. State-owned serfs, who made one-third of the serf population, were not freed until 1863, meaning that for those under his own ownership, Alexander II was no Tsar Liberator at first. In addition to this, those freed were under obligation to pay ‘redemption payments’ for 49 years after their emancipation, to compensate landowners for their loss of free labour. This meant that not only did peasants now have additional financial obligations, but they remained tied to the land, not ‘liberated’ by any means. As well as this, peasant holdings were too small to effectively farm and make a profit, and peasants were often given the worst land for farming whilst the landowners got the best parts. Those who moved into the cities (very few did - the urban population was only 7% of the total population in 1863) in the hope of success found that, whilst they earned marginally better wages, their living conditions were poor, their food rations low, and their work difficult and long. This shows that even those who were able to take advantage of the Tsar’s ‘liberation’ did not prosper. The Kulak class, whilst existent, was very small. Despite the aims of Alexander II’s emancipation edict, the effect on the population of Russia was very limited. Peasants remained immobile, poor, and lived in squalor, and even those with new opportunities were unable to make a living. Very little change was brought about in reality, and so the argument cannot be made that Alexander II deserves the title of Tsar Liberator.

Whilst a lesser factor than emancipation, a major contributor to Alexander II being named ‘Tsar Liberator’ were his various other reforms in different areas of government and society. However, despite being an attempt at liberalisation, they too failed to live up to their aims. One major change that Alexander II introduced was local government reform. This created a local body called the ‘zemstva’ which would be in charge of managing the affairs of small regions of the country. Technically, elections to the zemstvo were free and democratic, and whilst there is no evidence to dispute their electoral legitimacy, the body was often dominated by nobles - approx. 70% of the zemstvo were nobles in rural areas. This meant that, despite aiming to enfranchise the peasantry and devolve power, local government decisions were still primarily made by the nobility, showing little liberalisation. Censorship was relaxed in 1868, with newspapers and other publications no longer having to be screened, and editors being given more freedom. However, not only did the government still have the right to pull publications, but Alexander II reversed these reforms later in his reign. In this case, despite early liberalisation, the reversal of these reforms de-legitimises the title of Tsar Liberator. Alexander II also introduced judicial reforms, which were intended to create a fairer court system. This was, to an extent, successful - the case of Vera Zasulich, who shot General Trepov, the governor of St. Petersburg, and was subsequently acquitted, is a good example of how the court system had become more independent - defendants were tried by an independent judge and a jury of their peers. However, military courts were not subject to this legislation, and governments officials could not be tried. Even in cases where Alexander II’s reforms saw success, they were still very limited in liberalising society and Russia as a whole, and so this contributes to the argument that Alexander II does not deserve the title of ‘Tsar Liberator’.

In conclusion, whilst Alexander II’s reforms were certainly an attempt at emancipation and general liberalisation, their limitations must cause us to conclude that, in reality and whatever his intentions may have been, Alexander II was no ‘Tsar Liberator’.
