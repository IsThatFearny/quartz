### Explain the following terms: Egalitarian; Tripartite system; Grammar School; Secondary Modern; Technical College

Egalitarian: The principle that all are equal and have equal rights

Tripartite System: The system of secondary education; split into three types of school: Grammar, Secondary Modern, and Technical College.

Grammar School: Those who did well on the 11+ exams were allowed to attend a Grammar School, which promoted academic excellence

Secondary Modern: Designed for the majority of children; taught practical skills such as arithmetic and geography

Technical College: Schools designed to prepare young people to take up a trade - taught engineering, woodwork, metalworking, etc.

</br>

### What fundamental problem had resulted from the Butler act of 1944?

The act had ‘cemented inequality of opportunity’ and made sure that many young people were designated ‘academic failures’.

</br>

### What were the longer-term consequences of this problem?

It caused educational reform to be deprioritised, and this became a major political battleground for the Labour party, as Attlee’s government had failed to address the problem.

</br>

### Why was education reform likely to be controversial?

- The tripartite system favoured the elite (of which many MPs were a part)
- There was a sense of ‘betrayal’ by Attlee
- The destruction of the independent sector was seriously discussed, and this was very controversial
- Educational reform (especially that of Crossland) was seen to be socialist

</br>

### What was Crossland’s ‘Circular 10/65’ and why was it so controversial?

The ‘circular 10/65’ was a notice requesting all Local Education Authorities to convert to comprehensive schools. This was not binding, but many authorities responded to it. It was controversial because it was a radical reform to the tripartite system, which many (especially the elite) believed to be working just fine.

</br>

### What was Crossland’s case for comprehensives? 

Crossland said that comprehensive schools would create much greater education equality. They were not selective, and allowed children to be educated to their own ability and at their own pace.

</br>

### What were the benefits and drawbacks of the comprehensive system?

##### Benefits

- ‘A grammar school education for all’ - Harold Wilson
- Amount of grammar schools reduced - allowed for less social division
- Greater educational equality, more children from working class backgrounds being educated to a higher standard

##### Drawbacks

- Middle class parents remained unconvinced by the comprehensive schools
- Changes in status caused considerable disruption
- Many turned to direct grant and independent schools
</br>

### Does the evidence provided indicate that the reform was successful?

No, it does not. It is stated that ‘the idea of a truly ‘comprehensive’ system was flawed from the start’, and that ‘many middle class parents remained unconvinced’

</br>

### Why was the expansion of higher education so important to Wilson?

He believed that it would help him in his campaign concerning the ‘white heat of technology’. He also believed that it would help with modernisation.

</br>

### Does the evidence suggest a ‘revolution’ in higher education?

Yes. Polytechnics were introduced, as were more universities. New institutions brought new, up to date, and modern courses for the modern age. 

</br>

### Who did Wilson appoint to oversee the Open University?

Wilson appointed Jennie Lee to oversee the project. This was significant, as she was from a humble, working-class background, and could only attend university with support from a trust.

</br>

### Why was the Open University Wilson’s proudest achievement in government?

The Open University combined his enthusiasm for equal opportunity in education, modernisation, and ‘the white heat of technology’. It embodied all that he stood for.

</br>

## Extension Questions

</br>

### 1) What assumptions were made in the 1950s and 1960s about the conduct of homosexuals?

It was assumed to be voluntary and predatory. Homosexuality and paedophilia were commonly associated with each other. All ‘victims’ were seen to be ‘touchingly innocent’.

</br>

### 2) What comparison does the author make in highlighting the nature of attitudes towards homosexuals at that time?

The author compares homosexuality and paedophilia, saying that the public did not always distinguish between the two.

</br>

### 3) What were the unpleasant consequences of this prejudice?

Homosexuality became viewed as a ‘problem’, even by some homosexuals. Homosexuals hid themselves and were not ‘encouraged to enlighten their critics’.

</br>

### 4) What was the vocabulary used to describe homosexuals in this period?

The prevalent vocabulary used to describe homosexuals were the terms ‘queer’, ‘deviant’, and ‘pervert’ (again highlighting the lack of distinction between homosexuality and paedophilia).

</br>

### 5) Which organisation was founded by Chad Varah to counter the rising number of male suicides in the face of society’s intolerance?

Chad Varah founded the Samaritans, which aimed to have an attitude of acceptance towards those who were potentially suicidal.

</br>

### 6) If homosexuality was viewed as ‘deviant behaviour’ brought on by mental illness, what were the recommended cures?

The traditional ‘cure’ was to usher the homosexual towards a prostitute, or to an experimental marriage. Medicalised cures included oestregen injections and aversion therapy.

</br>

### 7) What examples of high profile homosexuals are given, and how did they have to live their lives?

The Queen’s dress designer, Hardy Amies; the playwright Terrence Rattigan; Bishop Stockwood of Southwark; all of these people lived their lives in discretion, secrecy, and deceit. Some others would completely opt out of ‘normality’, instead choosing to live his life in relative solitude.

</br>

### 8) Why was blackmail of suspected homosexuals a rather more serious matter in the case of John Vassal

John Vassal photographed secret documents for the Russians, having been blackmailed into doing so. It showed that blackmail of homosexuals that was feasible by law could have serious consequences.

</br>

### 9) What does the case of the highly acclaimed actor, John Gielgud, reveal?

It reveals that even those who were high up in society (Gielgud was knighted) were not safe from being prosecuted, but also that there were some who supported homosexuals, as Gielgud was backed by his fellow actors in his bid to return to the stage.

</br>

### 10) Why did Gaitskell want an ‘all-party’ agreement - what was the problem facing Labour?

Gaitskell believed that Labour could not risk campaigning on its own on the issue. MPs were keen to uphold their reputation, and did not wish to risk their seats by backing the legalisation of homosexuality, which was a controversial issue that the majority of the electorate were not in favour of.

</br>

### 11) Why did many MPs welcome the reforming involvement of the unelected house of lords?

They did not want their reputation to be tarnished, and the house of lords were able to reform without any risk to their place in the chamber, as they were unelected.

</br>

### 12) What did the Wolfenden report recommend?

The report recommended that homosexual acts by consenting adults over the age of 21 should not be illegal. This effectively proposed full equality before the law for those in same-sex relationships.

</br>

### 13) Why was the letter to the Times in 1958 such an important milestone in the campaign?

The letter was backed by many intellectuals, such as Clement Attlee, J.B. Priestley, and Bertrand Russell. It backed the recommendations put forward by the Wolfenden report, and showed that those respected members of society were in favour of reform.

</br>

### 14) Why was Dirk Bogarde’s decision to play the lead in ‘Victim’ courageous?

The film showed sympathy with homosexuals, which was, at the time, still illegal. He was courageous because this could have backfired on him and his reputation significantly.

</br>

### 15) Why do we need to be careful when condemning the 1967 act for not going far enough?

The act went against the opinion of the general public, and it was still a major step forward for homosexual equality. Any further reforms, and the Labour government may have been severely criticised for giving homosexuals full equality, an incredibly controversial stance.
