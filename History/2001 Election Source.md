# 2001 Election Source


> From a research paper written by university professors, Paul Whiteley and Patrick Seyd, in May 2002. They specialised in election strategy and the impact of party campaigns on voters.

> Labour’s campaign, ‘Operation Turnout’, leading up to the 2001 general election, concentrated upon specific voters and constituencies. It targeted three groups. First, weak Labour supporters who were defined as first-time Labour voters in 1997; secondly, those whose support for the party had become less firm or who had not voted in local or European elections in the intervening years; and thirdly, Labour supporters in low turnout areas. The party believed that the problem with these weak Labour voters would not be that they might switch to other parties but that they might not vote. So Labour’s campaign strategy was to mobilise these people. Campaigning resources were concentrated upon 148 ‘priority’ seats and the party’s members were encouraged to work in these. Overall, the evidence suggests that Labour was able to do more reinforcing of its support than its main rivals; in particular the party out-campaigned its rivals by a significant margin when it came to reminding the voters to turn out on polling day.


The purpose of this source is to analyse Labour’s election strategy and its comparative success. This is valuable to the historian studying why the Tories lost the 2001 General Election, because it explains the reasoning behind Labour’s strategy, and how, when compared to the Tory Party, their election campaigning was more successful in terms of combating voter apathy. The nature and origin of this source also give value: not only was the research paper written relatively close to the campaign, but it is a peer-reviewed academic paper, which was written by university professors who specialise in the field, and therefore it can be trusted and its value is reinforced. The intended audience of the source is those who are interested in the 2001 General Election, and this is of value to the historian because the source is likely to appeal to those who already have prior knowledge of the event, and thus it is more likely to be written in such a way that gives sufficient detail for the historian to analyse the event in full. In terms of the thrust, the source gives the impression that Labour’s ‘Operation Turnout’ campaign was well thought out, resources were concentrated well, and it was generally a success when it came to preventing voter apathy from making Labour lose votes. This is of value to the historian, because it agrees with evidence that we already have: the Tory Party vote only went up by 1% in the 2001, when it was expected to go up by far more due to voter apathy, and so this shows that Labour were indeed relatively successful. This is also of value, however, as a contrasting view, because the turnout for the 2001 General Election was only 59%, showing that perhaps the campaign was not as successful as Labour might have hoped. Using the thrust, the historian is able to compare and contrast differing views on the election in order to synthesise them and come up with a general argument. The thrust of the source is supported by the tone, which is generally positive. Saying that “the party out-campaigned its rivals by a significant margin” creates a positive bias towards Labour’s campaign, suggesting that it worked well. This is also of significant value to the historian, because it again highlights the perceived success of Labour’s campaign. Overall, this source is highly valuable to the historian: not only does it give detailed explanation of ‘Operation Turnout’ and its aims, it also allows the historian to contrast differing views and statistics, and its likely accuracy due to its purpose, nature, and origin supports this further
