# Historians Toolkit Lecture 7 - Decolonising History


### What is decolonisation?

- Decolonisation is a historiographically-specific concept
- It reflects a *political process* whereby an imperial power cedes control over seized resources and its racially subjected people
- By focusing on the kinds of knowledge that were generated by colonialism, decolonisation seeks to de-naturalise 'whiteness' and focus on the experience of formerly dispossessed peoples, from their points of view
- **What is it to 'de-naturalise whiteness'?:** to make whiteness feel less like the 'norm'

### Four Key Concepts

- Colonialism has entailed intellectual legacies
- Colonialism has sustained institutional structures
- Decolonising addresses power and positionality
- Decolonising relocates the *margins* at the *centre*

### German Historicism

- Leopold von Ranke (1795-1888) legitimised History as a professional subject
- The key aspects of German Historicism are:
	- The historian is a neutral observer 'above' history;
	- 'Strict method' enables objective analysis;
	- The state is a divinely-ordained political unit
