#### According to Monica Green, why is it important that historians "widen the zoological lens" when thinking about the history of plague? 

*Yersinia Pestis* must have spread through various different species to reach certain remote locations (Green gives the example of the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau). *Homo Sapiens* of course had a major role to play in this, as did other mammalian and rodential species, other than the typically accepted theory involving transmission through fleas and rats.

#### How persuaded are you by her argument that we should seriously contemplate the possibility that plague was present in the Indian subcontinent far earlier than previously supposed? 

Green successfully argues for a re-examination of the origins of plague in India, deeming it too unlikely that *Yersinia Pestis* only entered the sub-continent in the 17th century due to India's proximity to the Tibetan highlands and other medieval plague-ridden regions. Whilst she is cautious to vehemently promote this view, warning against using vague and ambiguous evidence available, her argument that we should at least contemplate and perform research into the possibility that the Indian subcontinent was affected by plague much earlier than suggested seems reinforced by scientific research and corresponding events of mass migration.

#### What is "retrospective diagnosis" - and should historians engage in it?

Retrospective diagnosis is the attempt of historians to diagnose an illness in the past, often with little scientific (i.e. DNA) evidence, using secondary sources and descriptions of the illness. One problem with this is that we often want to apply modern methodology and medicine to historical outbreaks, a method which, of course, does not equate to what those at the time were experiencing and describing. Green says that retrospective diagnoses perfectly encapsulates the historians dilemma: "reconstruct the world as historical participants experienced it" or use modern science to find out "what really happened". Green's argument is that new evidence that comes to light should not be rejected entirely on the basis of an *emic* approach to history; but rather should be used as a new tool for discovery and reconstruction. Green makes an interesting point about the uses of modern medicinal knowledge in studying societies and civilisations who left little to no records (she uses the example of Zimbabwe). **My view:** Historians should reframe the idea of retrospective diagnosis and use it in the way the Green describes: as a "tool to think with"

#### How helpful are the Wikipedia entry on the Black Death and the excerpt from _The Middle Ages: A Very Short Introduction_ for understanding the key questions about plague that historians are grappling with and why these questions matter?

**Wikipedia:** Provides some alternative explanations for the spread of plague and explains limitations on historical research. There is mention of the role of humans in spreading the plague, but alternative zoological possibilities are mentioned little, if at all. Good explanation of the development of theories about spread and origin.

**Oxford V. Short Introductions:** Incredibly limited exposition of primary vectors beyond the previously accepted consensus involving rats and ships, with little room for thinking about alternatives. No mention of Green's proposal of the Indian subcontinent or east Asia (although Asia is mentioned as an origin). Much emphasis placed on Black Sea trading, no attention payed to land-based vectors.
