Varlik argues that an Ottoman experience of plague is not only valuable in our wider understanding of plague histories, but is in fact essential to scholarship on the subject. She makes the argument that considering a previously invisible Ottoman perspective necessitates the abolition of the "spatio-temporal epidemiological boundaries" that have been formulated by previous scholars, and also posits that a more complex view of plague transmission is suggested by the Ottoman experience of plague.

In evidencing the former argument, Varlik argues that, whilst eurocentric views of plague often periodise three distinct 'waves' of the disease, the Ottoman experience blurs the lines between these periods. She says that there is substantial evidence of plague in Ottoman cities between the Second and Third pandemics, such as the observations of Charles Maclean; thus the scholarship that argues for strict periodisation of plague infections is too limited in geographical scope, and must be revised to include the Ottoman experience.

Varlik focuses further on plague persistence in order to support the latter argument. Ottoman cities, she argues, were repeatedly exposed to the plague during the Second Pandemic, with Istanbul experiencing an outbreak an average of every 2.2 years during this time, and she proposes that this is largely due to high levels of plague persistence in mammalian and rodent populations: in a population of 60,000 rats, *y. pestis* has been shown to be able to survive for 100 years. Varlik says that this evidence suggests that the study of plague transmission would benefit from a regional and internal analysis of transmission: it was not always the case that the disease was imported. Indeed, there is evidence to show that the persistence of plague in Ottoman lands was a result of plague reservoirs in the highlands.

Varlik involves herself in the debate over globalisation of plague experiences.  Her article challenges eurocentrism in contemporary plague scholarship, and the suggestion that the typical periodisation and spatial division which characterises much of the literature surrounding the plague is a flawed conception is of great value to the future of the field, as it seems to allow one to gain an improved and more accurate picture of plague on a global stage.
