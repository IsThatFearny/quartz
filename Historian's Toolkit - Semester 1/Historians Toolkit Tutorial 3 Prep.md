#### What are the key claims of Geltner's article?

Geltner claims that cities such as Pistoia had introduced measures such as *viarii* and other healthscaping measures in order to prevent and control disease long before the Black Death caused the introduction and documentation of quarantine measures and similar policies in European cities. 

#### How does he attempt to justify the key claims?

Geltner argues that Pistoia had many anti-disease measures in place before the Black Death took hold, such as a team of what were effectively customs officers who would enforce safe importation of goods and ensure disease was not being introduced to the city, as well as the maintenance of urban infrastructure to ensure that the spread of disease would be slowed if such an epidemic hit. The citizenry were expected to keep their city clean and free from disease as well. Geltner uses documented evidence of enforcement of such policy in order to support his claims.
#### What doÂ _you_ think are the most important repercussions of Geltner's article for how we should understand the history of public health, the history of disease and/or urban history?

I think that the most important repercussion of Geltner's article is causing historians to move away from the viewpoint that policy towards public health was entirely catalysed by singular epidemic events such as the Black Death, and instead analyse the history of public health prophylactics through a wider lense, i.e. focusing on development over time rather than a single event/point in time


#### Critically assess the example historiographical assignment. What does it do well and how could it be further improved?

The example is well-researched and assesses Barker's argument well, including its possible flaws and drawbacks (such as limited and vague evidence). However, it does not identify the controversy that Barker engages with in her article, and thus fails to fit Barker's argument into any wider context.
