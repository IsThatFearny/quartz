# Historians Toolkit Tutorial 4


- Historiography is often identified just after the introduction in an article
- Most primary sources used in writing about the history of the Indian Rebellion are sourced from the colonial archives - built and curated by the British, and populated with British sources
- EIC underestimated the organisational ability of oppressed cultures; EIC did not think them capable of organised uprising
- Previous scholarship implied that the rebellion was spontaneous - written this way by the British in order to prevent embarrassment

### Essay plan

**Thesis:**

- The Sepoys were not part of a popular movement

**Argument 1:**

- Sepoys were often recruited from high-caste families (i.e. high up the social order) and therefore did not identify with the peasantry and the lower classes

**Argument 2:**

- Sepoys considered themselves as the elite, and had aspirations to move even higher in society. Being part of a popular movement would undermine this ambition

**Argument 3:**

- During the rebellion, the Sepoys often were involved in conflict with the public, implying that the people were not entirely in support of their rebellion or did not see them as representatives or flag-bearers
