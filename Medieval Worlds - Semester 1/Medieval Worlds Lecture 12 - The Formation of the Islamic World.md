# Medieval Worlds Lecture 12 - The Formation of the Islamic World


- Islam as a religion was born during the medieval period (as opposed to Judaism and Christianity)
- Major traditional islamic sources include:
	- **The Quran:** the holy book, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad over 23 years
	- **Hadith:** Words, deeds, and silences of the Prophet
	- **Biographies:** *Sira* (Prophets' biography) and *maghazi* (war literature)
- Most of these sources were written down two or three centuries after the lifetime of Muhammad
- The Quran is *not* a history - it is a moral and doctrinal scripture - and thus sheds little light on the origins of Islam
- We have material evidence for the existence of Islam as early as the 7th century, e.g. Dome of the Rock, however this contradicts the standardised Quran and there are major inconsistencies
- One of the earliest surviving records of the Quran has been carbon dated between the late-6th and mid-7th century

### Muhammad

- Was born and grew up in Mecca as a member of the Quraysh tribe
- The Quraysh had many trade connections and were custodians of the Kaaba
- In c.610 he has the *visions/revelations* which form the basis of the Quran
- In c.622 he had to migrate to Medina to escape persecution
- c620s: he unites the Arabian tribes and defeats the Meccans in 630 CE

#### The Major Teachings

- Monotheism and rejection of idolatry
- Historical continuity with Judaism and Christianty
- Draws on figures such as Abraham, Moses, Jesus, etc. important to Jews and Christians. Considers them to be prophets who preached islamic messages, but whose followers deviated
- Preaches righteous living, emphasising moral conduct, behaviour, commanding right and forbidding wrong
- Daily prayers, annual fasting (Ramadan), charity and pilgrimage were important parts of his preaching

### The Early Caliphate

- The caliphate lasted from 632-661
- Caliphs were four of Muhammad's companions:
	- Abu Bakr (632-4)
	- Umar (634-44)
	- Uthman (644-56)
	- Ali (656-51)
- The latter three caliphs were all assassinated
- Shia and Sunni distinction created by a dispute over succession:
	- Sunni Muslims take the position that successors should be elected by consensus of *umma* (the community)
	- Shia Muslims say that successors should be direct descendants of Ali

</br>

### Islamic Expansions

- Various political conquests expanded Islam to the Arabian peninsula, Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Persia, etc.
- It encompassed the entirety of the Persian empire and half of the Byzantine empire
- There were also multiple diplomatic exchanges reaching as far as the Tang Empire

</br>

### Why was the Caliphate so successful?

- Imperial fatigue:
	- Byzantine-Sasanian war (602-28)
	- Built up Arab military experience for combatants on both sides
- Provincial and minority populations
	- Many minorities and regions had issues with imperial policies, e.g. the Jewish revolt, 613-14
- Arabian Mobility
	- Arab tribes were nomadic peoples
	- Many had experience in desert warfare by virtue of their location
- Unifying dynamics
	- Externalising struggle (*jihad*) united people
	- Religious ideology led to political cohesion

### Umayyads, 661-750

- Attempted to eradicate Ali's successors (Umayyads were Sunni)
- Killed Ali's son, Husain, in Karbala
- Established a dynasty that lasted for a century
- Primarily made up of garrison (military) settlements
- Relied on various taxation systems to fund the army
- Majority of subjects were non-muslim, but the elite in society were the Arab Military elite
- Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians were considered 'protected peoples', but were subject to the poll tax and certain social restrictions
