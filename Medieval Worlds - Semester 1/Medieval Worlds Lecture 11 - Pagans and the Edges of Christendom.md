# Medieval Worlds Lecture 11 - Pagans and the Edges of Christendom


### Monasticism

- Monks and Nuns attempt to escape/reject the world, whilst still living in the world
- Two types - hermitic and cenobitic monasticism. Hermits lived in isolation, completely separating themselves from society; cenobites lived in communities (i.e. monasteries and convents)
- Some anxiety about secular influence on monastic communities; monks serving too many masters

### Paganism

- Pagans are generally seen as those who live on the fringes of society, look after the environment, and are connected to the natural world
- Many European societies are implicitly taught that Paganism is something to be feared
- Paganism develops as Christianity builds in the Roman Empire
- Features of Paganism:
	- Polytheism
	- Belief that natural phenomena and objects have souls/spirits
	- Pre-christian illiterate societies (e.g. Celts, Franks, Germans, Scandinavians, etc.)
	- Ancient Greeks and Romans can also be called pagans
