# Medieval Worlds Lecture 6 - The Carolingian World


- Charlemagne crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III on **Christmas Day, 800 CE**
- Charlemagne has significant modern and contemporary significance (especially in Germany and France)

</br>

- Carolingian empire emerges from the Frankish Kingdom, originally under Merovingian rule (since c.450 CE):

**Key Figures:**

- Charles Martel (d. 741 CE)
	- Important aristocrat - mayor of the palace
	- *Carolus* (Latin for Charles) --> Carolingian
- Pippin (r. 751-768 CE)
	- Deposes the last Merovingian king
	- Anointed by Pope Stephen II in 745 CE, along with Carloman and Charles. Particularly significant because it shows that the eyes of the papacy were turning to Western Europe
- Charlemagne (r. 768-814 CE)
	- Expanded the Carolingian kingdom
	- Crowned Emperor of the Romans in 800 CE

</br>

**Imperial expansion:**

- A year without a military campaign was noteworthy
- Campaigning was a multifaceted venture:
	- A social event - networking and relationships between the elites
	- Highly lucrative - sacking rich cities where the spoils were shared amongst those involved (e.g. Pavia; the Avars; etc.)
	- Opportunities for consolidation of power - family rivals killed off (e.g. Duke of Bavaria, Carloman's children)
	- Christianisation - Saxony was a major battleground, its conquest was conceptualised as a mission for (forced) conversion

</br>

**Empire in practise**

- Carolingian culture less centred on courts
- Kings moved around from palace to palace rather than staying in a capital (e.g. Rome)
- Elites were both secular and ecclesiastical (*missi*, 'those who have been sent')
- Ideological language - e.g. Caesar, 'New Israel'
- Tolerance for legal pluralism and a sort of regional devolution
- Written word used as a tool of governance/politics

</br>

**Naturalising power:**

- Attempts to distinguish Carolingian rulers from Merovingians (e.g. facial hair, clothes, etc.)
- No rebellion against Carolingian rule that is not lead by another Carolingian; demonstrates success in naturalising power
- Worked closely with the church to practise '*correctio*', i.e. standardisation of religion and religious legislation

</br>

**Expansion of writing:**

- Explosion in the use of the written word - 1,800 remaining manuscripts from pre-800 CE, 9000 from 800-900 CE
- Carolingian script (miniscule) developed - easier to make letters out
- A mistake to think that only the clergy were involved in the explosion of literacy - many secular sources exist, although their preservation *is* largely down to ecclesiastical institutions
