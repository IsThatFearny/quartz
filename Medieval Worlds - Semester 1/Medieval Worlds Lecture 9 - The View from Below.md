# Medieval Worlds Lecture 9 - The View from Below

</br>

**Takeaways from the story of One-ox**
- The view of peasants has some absences from it - the nobility, the elites, etc. This is largely because the peasants were relatively apathetic to the ruling classes, who had little to no involvement in their day to day lives
- Legal status in the post-Carolingian world (i.e. free or enslaved) seems not to have mattered; what mattered was how wealthy an individual was
- Conspicuous absence of a judicial system in the post-Carolingian world; rather, the power was held by various manorial officials (e.g. bailiff, priest, mayor, etc.)
