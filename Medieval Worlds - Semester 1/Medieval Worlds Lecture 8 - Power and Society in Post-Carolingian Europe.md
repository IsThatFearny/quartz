# Medieval Worlds Lecture 8 - Power and Society in Post-Carolingian Europe


#### Feudalism

- Feudalism is often used as a historical keyword
- It is a part of (German) *begriffsgeschichte* - 'conceptual history'
- A main aspect of **early feudalism** is a legal arrangement involving property law
- In the **early modern** period, feudalism was extended to become an 'ideal type' of society
- Marc Bloch's conception of this included:
	- A subjected peasantry
	- Lack of salaries
	- Dominance of a militarised elite
	- Dominance of interpersonal rather than impersonal bonds
	- Fragmentation of political society
- In the **economic sense**, feudalism was a mode of production (the producers, of course, were the serfs). This perspective was largely advocated by Marx
- There are multiple contestations about our modern conception of feudalism. The following are put forward by **Susan Reynolds** and **Elizabeth Brown**. For example:
	- Feudal law didn't determine social arrangements in practice
	- Medieval societies weren't just hierarchical
	- The model of feudalism oversimplifies
- Feudalism aided the church to use land which they were not able to permanently sell on the basis of temporary leasing

- **Thomas Bisson** makes the argument that the power structure of medieval Europe broke down once the Carolingian empire collapsed - the year 1000 marks feudalism at its peak
- Post-Carolingian Europe was indeed more fragmented, but whether it was more feudal depends on one's definition of feudal
