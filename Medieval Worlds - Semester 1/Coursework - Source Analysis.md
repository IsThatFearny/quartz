### Hereford Mappa Mundi

The modern conception of a map is its purpose as a navigational aid; however, the Hereford *mappa mundi* was not created with such a purpose in mind. Rather, the map has a meaning that is more symbolic than practical. It can be argued that, rather than being intended as an accurate, proportional map of the world, is it instead intended to be a historical and eschatological record, with specific emphasis on the eschatological aspect.[^1] 

Christianity is central to the map and its imagery. For example, the depiction of Christ at the head (East) of the map implies his atemporal and omni-existence; there are various depictions of biblical scenes and locations (such as the Garden of Eden and the Holy Land), and various creatures that seem to be derived from a bestiary and are perhaps a manifestation of the effects of sin[^2]. Further to this, the decision of the map's creator to use a 'TO' layout implies that the map was centred around Christianity: the 'TO' layout serves to represent the division of the earth into three peoples, each descended from one of Noah's three sons, Shem (Asia), Ham (Africa), and Japheth (Europe).[^6] Such biblical imagery and clear Christian motifs support the notion that the Hereford map was originally created to be used in an ecclesiastical context such as an altarpiece or as guidance for pilgrims and those wishing to go through penitential rites.[^3] 

From a historical standpoint, one can observe many important events occurring throughout the map: for example, the city of Troy is depicted, as are the conquests of Alexander the Great and certain roman roads and routes. However, it would seem that such events only warrant inclusion for their merits as religious symbols: Alexander is one of three aside from Adam who have 'lordship of the world';  Troy is a town that is highly relevant to the quests of Aeneas; and of course the romans christianised much of the world during their height.[^4] 

It is important to note that, whilst the map's creator was likely trying to achieve a purpose other than geographical, such as those mentioned above, this does not necessarily mean that the map was not to be used in this way at all. Medieval scholars believed that an understanding of the physical world around them and their place in it would bring them closer to an understanding of God - after all, He is purported to have created all things, and thus an understanding of such things would serve to improve one's understanding of God's role.[^5] The map's rough geography would aid in such an understanding, and therefore its use as a geographical aid is evident.

It becomes quite clear that the creator the Hereford *mappamundi* intended the map as an ecclesiastical guide, and secondarily as a historical record of the landmark events in the Christian faith. Whether the map was to be used by pilgrims planning their route to the Holy Land; as a reaffirmation of God as 'all-encompassing'; as a method of connecting major historical world events to Christianity; or as guidance for those wishing to go through various penitential rites, there is overwhelming evidence that its purpose was as an ecclesiastical aid, and this is what its creator was attempting to achieve.
