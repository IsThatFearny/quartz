### Hereford Mappa Mundi

The modern conception of a map is its purpose as a navigational aid; however, the Hereford *mappa mundi* was not created with such a purpose in mind. Rather, the map has a meaning that is more symbolic than practical. It can be argued that, rather than being intended as an accurate, proportional map of the world, is it instead intended to be a historical and eschatological record[^1]. For example, the depiction of Christ at the head (East) of the map implies his atemporal and omni-existence; there are various depictions of biblical scenes and locations (such as the Garden of Eden), and various creatures that seem to be derived from a bestiary and are perhaps a manifestation of the effects of sin[^2]. Such biblical imagery and clear Christian motifs support the notion that the Hereford map was originally created to be used in an ecclesiastical context such as an altarpiece or as guidance for pilgrims and those wishing to go through penitential rites.[^3] 

From a historical standpoint, one can observe many important events occurring throughout the map: for example, the city of Troy is depicted, as are the conquests of Alexander the Great and certain roman roads and routes. However, it would seem that such events only warrant inclusion for their merits as religious symbols: Alexander is one of three aside from Adam who have 'lordship of the world';  Troy is a town that is highly relevant to the quests of Aeneas; and of course the romans christianised much of the world during their height.[^4]
