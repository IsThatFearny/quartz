  abstract = {The West as it stands today, has a long illustrious history of many feats, yet it makes a gruesome mistake of de-linking its past from a period of almost a thousand years by calling it the "Dark Ages". In recent times this trend has undergone some change and efforts have been made to restore that period to a more respectable status. However, still the best that could be achieved in terms of nomenclature is "Middle Ages." The present article is an endeavour to highlight the grandeur of the period that became the cause and source for later European developments on the one hand, and finding the reasons and factors responsible for the attempt to relegate the entire era as unworthy of notice and credit. Among one of those outstanding reasons was the rise, spread and influence of Islam, which for a very long period was the envy of the world, particularly in comparison to the so called "Dark Ages" of Europe. It came up with its own learning and culture, science and philosophy, medicine and statecraft, architecture and commerce that were unique in every way but were reluctantly accepted and hardly appreciated. Yet the impact could not be denied and remains a fact of history even if western authorship has continued to overlook the significance of it.},

  author = {Bakker, Gerben},
  abstract = {The nineteenth century saw the advent of news agencies that became well-coordinated global organisations with large networks of correspondents, such as Reuters, Havas, WolffContinental and Associated Press. Essential features of these agencies were substantial fixed and sunk set-up costs, high fixed operating costs, a marginal cost of supplying news to an additional customer of virtually zero, and the quasi-public good character of information, which had implications for the organisational form, marketing and pricing. To solve Arrow's fundamental paradox of information, agencies adopted subscriptions, because this made the marginal price of news zero. The news networks were operated by unique organisations whose evolution interacted with new technologies. The paper investigates how the news agencies emerged, whether and how they co-evoluted with infrastructure firms, what business models they pioneered, how they developed/discovered these models, and how they became encapsulated in an oligopolistic industry structure in the course of the nineteenth century.},

  abstract = {The current historical consensus is that English common law was somewhat confused, but that coerced servitude was legal in England before 1772, and certainly in its empire, where English law on slavery did not reach, because it was ``beyond the line'' of English justice. The common law is characterized by an effort to see continuity and consistency, and historians (despite our natural desire to track change) often look for those patterns too. Such efforts to provide a consistent overview of an England that was free and colonies that created slavery on their own{\textemdash}have obscured the vibrant struggle over slavery within the English judicial system{\textemdash}the common law{\textemdash}over more than a century. Not only did the common law on slavery change profoundly during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: the common law became an instrument of crown policy. It did so within a federal empire, wherein colonial legal norms had to adhere, in crucial ways, to that common law. English high court judges thus provided the legal foundation for an imperial common law of slavery that allowed people to be deemed absolute property. That definition of people as property was closely connected to absolutism, both in theory and practice. In theory the absolute power of kings over subjects was connected to that of masters over slaves. In practice, the crown's use of the courts to create laws without parliamentary consent (to bypass parliament) also increased crown revenue and thus their independence from parliamentary control. These powerful legal mechanisms made it possible to ``recover'' enslaved people as assets for debts, a legal definition that was essential for a market in people to function sucessfully. This history reveals the absolutist character of early capitalism, and the extent to which the character of capitalist development depends on the legal rules that define markets and justice.},

Plantation owners, shipbuilders, and merchants connected with the slave trade accumulated vast fortunes that established banks and heavy industry in Europe and expanded the reach of capitalism worldwide. Eric Williams advanced these powerful ideas inCapitalism and Slavery, published in 1944. Years ahead of its time, his profound critique became the foundation for studies of imperialism and economic development. Binding an economic view of history with strong moral argument, Williams's study of the role of slavery in financing the Industrial Revolution refuted traditional ideas of economic and moral progress and firmly established the centrality of the African slave trade in European economic development. He also showed that mature industrial capitalism in turn helped destroy the slave system. Establishing the exploitation of commercial capitalism and its link to racial attitudes, Williams employed a historicist vision that set the tone for future studies.},

  abstract = {Is there progress in philosophy? If so, how much? Philosophers have recently argued for a wide range of answers to these questions, from the view that there is no progress whatsoever to the view that philosophy has provided answers to all the big philosophical questions. However, these views are difficult to compare and evaluate, because they rest on very different assumptions about the conditions under which philosophy would make progress. This paper looks to the comparatively mature debate about scientific progress for inspiration on how to formulate four distinct accounts of philosophical progress, in terms of truthlikeness, problem-solving, knowledge, and understanding. Equally importantly, the paper outlines a common framework for how to understand and evaluate these accounts. We distill a series of lessons from this exercise, to help pave the way for a more fruitful discussion about philosophical progress in the future.},

We philosophers wrestle with the exact same problems the Pre-Socratics wrestled with. Even more outrageous than this claim, though, is the blatant denial of its obvious truth by many practicing philosophers. The No-Progress view is explored and argued for here. Its denial is diagnosed as a form of anosognosia, a mental condition where the affected person denies there is any problem. The theories of two eminent philosophers supporting the No-Progress view are also examined. The final section offers an explanation for philosophy's inability to solve any philosophical problem, ever. The paper closes with some reflections on philosophy's future.},

This article argues that it is essential to understand the Haitian Revolution, over 200 years after its triumph, in order to reflect upon the profound social importance of this event led by slaves - a feature that explains its peculiarities, historical significance and the stigma that it and the Haitian nation have suffered.},

In the complex diplomatic and economic negotiations between Haiti's first leader, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and the lieutenant governor of Jamaica, George Nugent, the two sought to answer unprecedented questions in the months before and after Dessalines's rebel forces defeated the French army. Nugent considered how British officials would regulate trade between British merchants and Haitians but was concerned that Haitian merchants and sailors would spread the spirit of rebellion throughout the New World. Could slavery and universal freedom coexist in the Caribbean without dramatic consequences for the British Empire? The full documentary evidence of how both sides aggressively pursued their objectives during 1803 and 1804 casts a new light on why Atlantic world empires and nations settled on policies of diplomatic isolation for Haiti by the end of the first decade of the nineteenth century. The Haitian Declaration of Independence raised profound questions about revolutionary legitimacy and national sovereignty and drastically expanded the ideals of the age of revolutions.},

It is argued that communica tion networks grow out of existing social/business networks, which in turn re flect previous communication and transport networks, and that the main imme diate effect of a new mode is to increase communication with existing contacts while in the longer run, new practices develop.},

Elsewhere, the British conglomerate Eastern and Associated retained its hegemony until the 1920s. Following World War I, radiotelegraphy threatened the dominance of cables.

Rather than representing the defeat of abolitionism by free trade zeal, the sugar question was a contest of two varieties of anti-slavery thought which had previously co-existed: one believing that slavery's immorality was accompanied by its productive infer{\`i}onty to fr{\'e}e labour and the other asserting that slavery's profits in this world were punished outside the marketplace. West Indian decline after the end of protection led to a revision of free labour super{\`i}or{\`i}ty, with providential externalities replacing marketplace competitiveness. The episode demonstrates how little most Butons understood the welfare of blackfieedmen to be connected to anti-slavery after emancipation. A fuller appreciation of the slave sugar debate furthermore recovers an important abolitionist strand in the new turnan 'history' of free trade.},

It explores how discourses around race and labour, which had evolved in the context of emancipation and its aftermath, resonated with the assumptions encoded in the legislation. It then examines how Black Caribbean women mobilized to push back against the exclusions which followed. In so doing, it speaks to Black women's interventions in the political life of the Third Republic to resist their exclusion from the emerging French welfare state.},

I argue for the sceptical conclusion that the existence of widespread disagreement throughout the history of philosophy, and right up until the present day indicates that philosophers are highly unreliable at arriving at the truth. If truth convergence indicates progress in a field, then there is little progress in philosophy. This sceptical conclusion, however, need not make us give up philosophizing: That we should currently be sceptical of our philosophical beliefs is a contingent fact. We are an intellectually immature species and given the existence of the deep future we have some reason to think that there will be truth-convergence in philosophy in the future.},

But not in the case of philosophy, if we abstract it from the obvious and the trivial, like the number of books on philosophy.

This review essay offers a critical rereading of existing scholarship while simultaneously suggesting new perspectives for research. Telegraphy = globalization, the history of wiring the world commencing with the Atlantic cable of 1866 seems to suggest. At the same time, this essay argues, this equation should make scholars uneasy and cautious of a possible technological determinism retracing its steps back into the middle of scholarly debates on globalization. More attention needs to be paid to whose globalization we are talking about, what the globalization of politics, markets, and media means in connection to communication, and whether the cables really started something radically new. 150 years after laying the "first" Atlantic cable, there is still room for research. New spaces, theories, and methodologies, as well as alternate user groups including women and subalterns, offer avenues to test established scholarship on global communications.},

This project not only initiated the development of world-wide subma rine telegraph networks, but also the formation of a cable community, the Class of 1866, and their subsequent networks, as for example the Society of Telegraph Engineers, that came to dominate the global cable market economi cally, politically and culturally. The Atlantic cable project of 1866 represented the central reflection point within the history of submarine telegraphy and the Atlantic cable pioneers used it to legitimate their status as exclusive cable elite. With banquets, soirees and other festivities as well as in their diaries, memoirs and official histories of the cabling of the Atlantic, the Class of 1866 greatly influenced the historic perception of its contemporaries and until today.},

  abstract = {The year 1944 saw the publication of Capitalism and Slavery in the United States. Authored by Eric Williams, a young colonial West Indian Negro and professor at Howard University, the book shattered conventional wisdom by intertwining and recasting the histories of European industrialization, African enslavement, and abolitionism. Though Williams's three-quarter century old work has been often reprinted and remains revered as something of a bible among postcolonial radicals, it has suffered a form of blasphemy in recent years. An influential and growing body of US-based historical studies invested in ``rethinking capitalism and slavery'' has cited the old study in ways that misrepresents its contentions. Capitalism and Slavery has been miscomprehended in books like Empire of Cotton: A Global History (2014) by Sven Beckert, The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism (2014) by Edward E. Baptist, Empire of Necessity: Slavery, Freedom and Deception in the New World (2016) by Greg Grandin, and River of Dark Dreams: Slavery and Empire in the Cotton Kingdom (2015) by Walter Johnson. This scholarship, though impressive in many regards, twists out of Williams' text a thesis that he never proposed. Extending a North Atlantic tradition that dates to the 1960s', the authors have tied Williams to a claim about the ``incompatibility'' between capitalism and slavery that is entirely at odds with his argument. Ultimately the new Americanist efforts to rethink the relationship between capitalism and slavery have wound up ``throwing shade'' on Williams' writing rather than illuminating it.},

However, much of this work leaves unclear what entity is the subject of these epistemic states. Furthermore, by focusing only on states like knowledge, we overlook progress in intermediate cases between ignorance and knowledge {\textendash} for example, many now celebrated theories were initially so controversial that they were not known. This paper develops an improved framework for thinking about intellectual progress. Firstly, I argue that we should think of progress relative to the epistemic position of an intellectual community rather than individual inquirers. Secondly, I show how focusing on the extended process of inquiry (rather than the mere presence or absence of states like knowledge) provides a better evaluation of different types of progress. This includes progress through formulating worthwhile questions, acquiring new evidence, and increasing credence on the right answers to these questions. I close by considering the ramifications for philosophical progress, suggesting that my account supports rejecting the most negative views while allowing us to articulate different varieties of optimism and pessimism.},

  abstract = {Eric Williams' recently published dissertation, The Economic Aspect of the Abolition of the West Indian Slave Trade and Slavery (Rowman \& Littlefield, 2014 [1938]) provides a more nuanced explanation of the "decline thesis" than what is found in Capitalism and Slavery (University of North Carolina, 1944). In light of the enormous impact Capitalism and Slavery has had on the abolition literature, it is surprising that historians engaged in this particular facet of the "Williams debate" have not invoked this earlier work. Williams, in his dissertation, makes it clear that there were three different, but overlapping economic and political-economic forces that undermined Britain's slave system in the late-eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. First, he explains that in the years leading up to the abolition of the British slave trade (1807), British sugar growers faced economic distress due to foreign competition and a subsequent collapse in sugar prices. Secondly, he observes that this downturn in the plantation's profitability was cotemporaneous with the decline in the sugar sector's relevance to the British economy, as Britain's domestic industrial sector expanded. Lastly, Williams argues that policy makers turned against the sugar planters' cherished colonial system and embraced a freer trade policy in the mid-1820s. Because of the liberalized commerce with Latin America, in particular, the United Kingdom was able to emancipate its own slaves and still enjoy the fruits of other nations' enslaved labor.},

He defends the large and surprising claim that `there is progress on all or reasonably many of the big questions'. However, Stoljar's caveats and admitted avoidance of historical evidence permits overlooking persistent controversies in philosophy of mind and cognitive science that are essentially unchanged since the 17               th               Century. Stoljar suggests that his claims are commonplace in philosophy departments and, indeed, the evidence I adduce constitutes an indictment of the widely shared view among professional analytic philosophers.},

The article attempts to place Edward I's patronage in line with the later template of Edward III. In reassessing the judgements of K. B. McFarlane and M. C. Prestwich, the article reconsiders Edward's policy of land grants in England, Wales and Scotland, and also draws upon new material such as the king's grants of deer from the royal forests, charters of free warren and the remission of debts to the exchequer.},
