# Text Elements
Biases in Decision Making ^NqUw8qnA

Consumers do not always act rationally. They might have rules-of-thumb (heuristics)
that they use to simplify decision making, and this might cause them to act irrationally. ^CeDu1MH4

Social Norms ^omIVmN3n

Say there are two restaurants, one empty,
one with a long queue. Consumers are more
likely to queue for their food, because others
are too. Other people's behaviour creates
a bias in the consumer. Social pressure
encourages consumers to do things that they
usually wouldn't, or that they know to be
harmful. Consumers are unwilling to go against
the norms of their society ^WrL7J8Pi

Anchoring ^fMzs3um2

This is a bias created by the human tendency
to rely on the first piece of information that
they are given. This piece of information
causes subsequent information to considered
less important. E.g. if a car's price is high,
but is on sale for a lower price, the consumer
is inclined to think that this is reasonable. ^zbt5tEsj

Altruism ^DDYTHFEi

Altruism is the act of being selfless and
considerate towards other people. Humans
tend to act kindly towards others when it
brings mutual benefit or when it is considered
fair. This may change the consumer's perception ^qcrYbs7A

Availability ^2FD1EjPy

Consumers will be biased towards events that
were recent, personal, or memorable. For
example, consumers are likely to think that
plane accidents are more likely to occur if
they or someone they know have been in one.
This type of bias can be spread across
populations by news and media. ^IL3ymsrl
