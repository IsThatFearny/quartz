Determinants of Aggregate Demand - Capital Investment ^4V70gTL7

Consumption + Investment + Gov. Spending + (Exports - Imports) ^JH0Aeo3U

Capital investment accounts for around 15-20% of GDP in the UK per year. About 3/4 of this
comes from private sector firms, and the remainder (1/4) is from government spending. ^yAxQcvVE

Influences on Investment ^e2g0oRQN

Rate of growth: If growth is high, firms will be making more revenue due to higher rates of consumer
spending, which means that they will have more profits available to invest.

Business expectations and confidence: If firms expect a high rate of return, they will invest more.
Firms need to be certain about the future, otherwise they will postpone investments. Expectations
about society and politics can also affect investment, e.g. a change in government or an increase in
commodity prices.

 ^rrcv6Dbs

Demand for exports: The higher demand is, the more likely it is that firms will invest. They expect higher
sales, and so they might direct capital goods into the markets where consumer demand is increasing.

Interest rates: Investment increases as interest rates fall, so the cost of borrowing is less and the
return to lending is higher. The higher interest rates are, the greater the opportunity cost of not saving
the money. High interest rates may also make firms expect a fall in consumer spending, which will discourage
investment.

Access to credit: If lenders are unwilling to lend, firms will find it harder to gain the funds for investment.

Influence of the government: The rate of corporation tax could affect investment. Lower taxes means firms
keep more profits, which can encourage investment. ^0fLDyRUh
