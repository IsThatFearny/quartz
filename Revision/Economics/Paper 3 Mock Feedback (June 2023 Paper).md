### MCQs

1) Stupid mistake - favourable weather may lead to an increase in supply, but this was not the cause of the fall in price, an increase in demand was. RTQ
2) Scarce resources - scarcity leads to opportunity cost
10) Multiplier effect must be revised. Need better understanding of the maths behind this
11) Need to revise output gaps. Better understanding needed of reasons for and indicators of
12) Monetarist economists assume V and Q to be stable. Fisher equation revision needed
15) Thinking too socialist! Workers do not control the means of production! Divorce of ownership from control means that shareholders get less of a say in management. Managers will satisfice because they have no fear of repercussions
16) Phillips curve revision needed, both short and long run. Need to look at the difference between the two
18) Increasing liquidity ratio will not increase money supply - the money is already in the economy. Quantitative easing is the only option that will bring more money into the money supply
20) Market failure revision needed - social optimum especially
21) Secondary income of current account needs to be looked at
22) No knowledge of comparative advantage/absolute advantage. Need to learn how to better calculate opportunity cost
23) Needed to look closer at the data. If one currency strengthens against another, then a currency that strengthens against said currency will strengthen against both
27) Lorenz curve and gini coefficient revision needed. Gini more so
28) Effects of shifts in LRAS needs to be revised

### 10 Marker

- Question asked for comparative data. Occasionally used this, but often used one-country data (e.g. tea market paragraph).
- Need to use a wide spread of data
- Use the obvious data - HDI was right there and not used
- Better paragraphing needed - split up points
- If criticising a figure, check that limitations are not mitigated by another piece of data
- Better phrasing - not ‘welfare’, but ‘development’. Use words in the questioning rather than paraphrasing
