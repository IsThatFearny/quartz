Market-Based vs Interventionist Policies ^GTMUIciu

Market-based policies limit the intervention of the government and allow the free market to eliminate imbalances.
The forces of supply and demand are used. Interventionist policies rely on the government intervening in the market.
 ^fNeDwHiq

Free Market Supply-Side Policies ^i4YbTaAX

To increase incentives: Reducing income and corporation tax to encourage spending and investment. This could increase
the long run productive potential of the economy, especially if labour and capital becomes more productive. This
improves the underlying trend of economic growth.

To promote competition: By deregulating or privatising the public sector, firms can compete in a competitive market,
which should also help improve economic efficiency.

To reform the labour market: Reducing the national minimum wage or abolishing it altogether will allow free market
forces to allocate wages and the labour market should clear. Reducing trade union power makes employing workers
less restrictive and it increases the mobility of labour. This makes the labour market more efficient. ^w8kTAEjI

Interventionist Supply-Side Policies ^wln9d6CJ

To promote competition: A stricter government competition policy could help reduce the monopoly power of some firms
and ensure smaller firms can compete.

To reform the labour market: Governments could try and improve the geographical mobility of labour by subsidising the
relocation of workers and improving the availability of job vacancy information.

To improve skills and quality of the labour force: The government could subsidise training or spend more on education.
This also lowers costs for firms, since they will have to train fewer workers. Spending more on healthcare helps to
improve the quality of the labour force, and contributes towards higher productivity.

To improve infrastructure: Governments could spend more on infrastructure, such as improving roads and schools. ^SUkHrZKP
