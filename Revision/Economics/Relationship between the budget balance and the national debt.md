Relationship between the budget balance and the national debt ^8Sw21RVW

The government budget is comprised of tax revenues and government expenditure. A government has a budget surplus
when tax receipts exceed expenditure. A government has a budget deficit when expenditure exceeds tax receipts in a
financial year. The government has a balanced budget when expenditure is equal to revenue.

It is important to distinguish between the government debt and the government deficit. The national debt is the
accumulation of the government deficit over time. It is the amount the government owes. The deficit (or surplus) is the
difference between expenditure and revenue at any one point.

If the government is continuously running a deficit, the size of the debt increases. If the government reduces the size
of their deficit, the rate of increase of the total debt is slower, but the debt is still increasing. It is only when the 
government runs a budget surplus that the size of the national debt decreases. ^hRh4e5ub
