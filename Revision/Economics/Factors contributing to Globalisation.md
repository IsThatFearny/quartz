Factors contributing to Globalisation ^VCCaJS0A

Trade in Goods ^WdUT09Ec

Developing countries have acquired the capital and
knowledge to manufacture goods. The efficient forms
of transport make it easier and cheaper to transfer
goods across international borders. Some developing
countries have the cost advantage of cheaper labour,
so MNCs move their production abroad. This causes
developed countries to trade with these developing
countries, so they can access the same manufactured
goods. ^A0T8ztMv

Trade in Services ^jsr4UUDk

For example, the trade of tourism, call centre services,
and software production has increased from developing
countries to developed countries. ^LmgoWbYg

Trade Liberalisation ^s4dSe2hn

The growing strength and influence of organisations such
as the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which advocates
free trade, has contributed to the decline in trade
barriers. ^EPP6tJic

Multinational Corporations ^XQGWRpa5

MNCs are organisations which own or control the production
of goods and services in multiple countries. They have used
marketing to become global, and by growing, they have been
able to take advantage of economies of scale, such as
risk-bearing economies of scale. The spread of technological
knowledge and economies of scale has resulted in lower
costs of production. ^73rH9Zdl

International financial flows ^LNExAenV

Communications and IT ^7BO8Ngoi

The spread of IT has resulted in it becoming easier
and cheaper to communicate, which has led to the
world being more interconnected. There are better
transport links and the transfer of information has
been made easier. This is sometimes referred to as the
'death of distance'. ^BjlCfaFN

This has resulted in it becoming cheaper to ship goods
across the world. This causes prices to fall, which helps
to make the market more competitive. Containerisation
means that goods are distributed in standard sized
containers, so it is easier to load and cheaper to
distribute using rail and sea transport. This helps to
meet world demand. Cargo can be moved twenty times
as fast as before, economies of scale can be exploited
and less labour is required. However, it is mainly MNCs
which have been able to exploit this, and it could result
in some structural unemployment. ^YkVnGGUQ

For example, the flow of capital and FDI across
international borders has increased. China and
Malaysia have financed their growth with capital
flows. Also, the foreign ownership of firms has
increased. There has been more investment in
factories abroad. The removal of capital controls
has facilitated this increase. ^nAoN46To
