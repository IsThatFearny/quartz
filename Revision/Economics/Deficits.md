Deficits ^qHNym6Vb

Cyclical Deficit ^QZ0KHJks

This is a temporary deficit, which is related to the business cycle. A deficit might occur during
recessions, when governments increase spending to stimulate the economy. ^batZH9xR

This is a deficit which is due to an imbalance in the revenue and expenditure of the government,
so it exists at every point in the business cycle. ^hZiLUK6m

Consequences of budget deficits and surpluses
 ^ZHNAw9fv

A fiscal deficit could be inflationary if it increases AD. More government spending could lead to
crowding out of the private sector. This leaves fewer funds in the private sector for firms to
use, since the government is borrowing money, which crowds them out of the market. It could
lead to increased interest rates. This is because the government has to offer investors an
attractive rate in order to encourage them to buy the debt. ^CNNZwILj

Structural Deficit ^KwS9oAIn
