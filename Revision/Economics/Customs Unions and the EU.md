Customs Unions and the EU ^rZb4ONcY

Countries in a customs union have established a common trade policy with the rest of the 
world. For example, they might use a common external tariff. It also has free trade
between members. The EU is an example of a customs union. Common markets establish
free trade in goods and services, a common external tariff and allow free movement of
capital and labour across borders. When the EU was established, it was a Common Market.
EU citizens can work in any country in the EU.

Other features of a customs union include:

- Safety measures for imported goods, such as for food, are common across all members

- There are common customs rules and procedures

- There is a structure for the combined administration of member states

- There is a common trade policy, which helps to create and guide trading relationships with
  countries and blocs outside the customs union. ^Juk827MD

- Free movement of goods, services, capital, and labour between nations

- Administrative provisions, laws, and regulators are approximated between member states.
  This could mean that some laws are better suited to some countries, and not so much for 
  others.

- Competition policy is common across the whole of the EU

- There are common external tariffs ^QNDpDHqH

With more trading blocs, trade has been created between members,
but diverted from elsewhere. Trade creation occurs when a country
consumes more imports from a low cost producer, and fewer from a
high cost producer. Trade diversion occurs when trade shifts to a
less efficient producer. Usually, a country might stop importing from
a cheaper producer outside a trading bloc to a more expensive one
inside the trading bloc. Moreover, protectionist barriers are often
imposed on countries who are not members, so trade is diverted from
producers outside the bloc to producers within. The UK trades mainly
with the EU, at the expense of former trade links in the commonwealth.

Reduced transaction costs: Since there are no barriers to trade or no
border controls, it is cheaper and simpler to trade.

Economies of Scale: Firms can take advantage of a larger potential
market in which to trade. For example, the EU has 500 million people to
sell to. By specialising, firms and countries can exploit their comparaitve
advantages, and the gains of efficiency and advanced technology can be
reaped.

Enhanced competition: Since firms operate in a more competitive market, they
become more efficient and there is a better allocation of resources. There
could be the long run benefits of dynamic efficiency too, although these
benefits are not always spread evenly across each member.

By being a member of a customs union, the supply of labour is increased, which
could help fill labour shortages. However, this might mean some countries lose 
their best workers.
