World Trade Organisation ^0rdJz000

The World Trade Organisation promotes world trade through reducing trade barriers
and policing existing agreements. It also settles trade disputes, by acting as the judge,
and organises trade negotiations.

Every member of the WTO must follow the rules. Those who break the rules face trade
sanctions. In addition to trade in goods, the WTO covers the trade in services and
intellectual property rights.


Trading blocs might distort world trade or adversely affect those who do not belong to
them. There could be an inefficient allocation of resources as a result of policies such
as the EU cap. Conflicts between blocs could lead to a rise in protectionism. A common
external tariff contradicts the WTO's principles, since although there is free trade 
between members, protectionist barriers are imposed on those who are not members.

Some countries might argue that the WTO is too powerful, or that it ignores the problems
of developing countries. This could be since developed countries do not trade completely
freely with developing countries, which limits their ability to grow.

Setting up a customs union or a free trade area could be seen to violate the WTO's
principle of having all trading partners treated equally. This is especially if a common external
tariff is applied. However, they can complement the trading system and the WTO strives to
ensure that non-members can trade freely and easily with the members of a trade bloc. ^0WRHntRo
