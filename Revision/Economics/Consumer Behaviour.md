Consumer Behaviour ^WWzDzHyV

Utility Theory ^AI8L8o0I

Consumers aim to maximise their utility, and firms
aim to maximise their profits. A consumer's utility
is the total satisfaction received from consuming
a good or service. 

Marginal utility is the extra
satisfaction gained from consuming one extra unit
of the good. The demand curve is downward sloping
because or diminishing marginal utility. The law of
diminishing marginal utility suggests that consumer
surplus generally declines with extra units consumed.
Consumers are willing to pay less for extra units. ^JMoZe2Lm

Economic agents respond to incentives, which can
allocate scarce resources to provide the highest
utility to each agent. For example, for an entrepreneur,
the incentive for taking risks is profit.

Rewards are positive incentives which will make consumers
better off, whereas penalties make them worse off. Where
incentives are not given properly, resources will be misallocated.
Prices in market economies provide signals to buyers and sellers,
which is an incentive to purchase or sell the good. This changes
their behaviour.

An entrepreneur wants to avoid loss and gain profit, which
encourages them to innovate, reducing production costs and
improving the quality of their products. Firms need an incentive
to engage in risk-taking, so they innovate. Without this, production
will cost more and there will be a misallocation of resources. ^Vm3shWsS
