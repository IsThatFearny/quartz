Costs of Production ^aWsOpCIF

In the short run, at least one factor of production cannot change. This means there are some fixed
costs. In the long run, all factor inputs can change. This means that all costs are variable. The
measure of the short run varies with industry. There is no standard. For example, the short run for
the pharmaceutical industry is likely to be significantly longer than the short run for the retail industry. ^1g0iffMB

Fixed costs:


Variable Costs:


Total cost:


Average cost:


Marginal Cost: ^Hb58CcGD

costs which do not vary with output. For example, rents, advertising, and capital goods are
fixed costs. They are indirect.

   costs which change with output. They are direct costs. For example, the cost of raw
   materials increases as output increases.

the cost to produce a given level of output. Calculated by:
Total Cost = total variable cost + total fixed costs.

  the cost per unit. Calculated by:
  Average Cost = Total Cost / Quantity Produced

  the cost of producing one extra unit of output. According to the law of diminishing returns,
  after a certain point, marginal costs rise as output increases. ^gm1e4qJZ
