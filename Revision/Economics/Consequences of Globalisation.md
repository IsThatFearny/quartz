Consequences of Globalisation ^fQ18QxQg

Individual Countries ^s1Rzg426

There could be trade imbalances between countries.
For example, the US runs a large current account
deficit with China, who has a large current account
surplus. There could be imbalances and inequalities
in consumers' and countries' accesses to health,
education, and markets. Within individual countries,
there could be income and wealth inequalities if the
benefits and costs of globalisation are not evenly
spread. This is evident in China, where the population
in the rural and urban areas have vastly different
levels of income and living standards. Culture could
spread across the globe. Some might say that this
has weakened culture and that there has been a
loss of cultural diversity due to global brands.
However, others will argue that the spread of culture
has been positive and helped to improve their quality
of life. ^WlFEFDvP

Governments ^9xZUNd0G

Some governments might lose their sovereignty due to
the increase in international treaties. Individual states
would find it hard to resist the force of them, and if
countries become members of organisations, they will have
to abide by their rules. ^E1hruJv1

Producers and Consumers ^ax6xOdNx

Globalisation leads to a general increase in world
GDP, which increases consumer living standards and
helps lift people out of poverty. However, it is hard
to calculate the proportion of growth which was due
to globalisation. This rise in average consumer incomes
could offset some of the lower costs of production for
firms. This is especially due to increased demand from
China, which has contributed to the increase in price
of commodities, and therefore pushed up the price of
raw materials. ^MEjWRzuU

Workers ^qwdk6lsl

Workers can take advantage of job opportunities across 
the globe, rather than just in their home country.
However, there could be structural unemployment. For example, 
in the UK after the collapse of the ship building and mining 
industries, there was a lot of structural unemployment. This 
is because it was more efficient for manufacturing to occur
abroad, so production shifted to lower labour cost nations.
However, it could be argued that countries would have had 
the change from agriculture to manufacturing to services 
anyway, and globalisation simply sped it up. When production 
shifts to lower labour cost countries, the creation of jobs 
could be seen as either beneficial or harmful. On one hand, 
MNCs could be exploiting their labour and providing poor working 
conditions in, for example, sweatshops. On the other hand, 
working in a sweatshop might provide a higher, more stable income
than any alternatives, such as agriculture. ^E8WE7Y1W

Although industrialisation and increased consumer living standards might lead to
more pollution through increased production and increased car use, consumers
might show more concern towards the environment as their average incomes
increase.
Some of the negative impacts on the environment could include deforestation,
water scarcity and land degradation.  ^mhsoSOZt

Consumers and producers can earn the benefits of
specialisation and economies of scale as firms become larger.
Firms operate in a more competitive environment, which
encourages them to lower their average costs and become
more efficient. Producers can also make their average costs
lower by switching production to places with cheaper labour.
the spread of technology has resulted in firms being able to
employ the most advanced machines and production methods. ^v3LNp1sy

The Environment ^mFUBuk7n
