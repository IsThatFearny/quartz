Characteristics of Markets ^2U1Kikpy

There are a range of market structures. The market structure is concerned with how the market
is organised. The different market structures can be depicted on a spectrum. ^Oi5hMrO0

Perfect
Competition ^UkdNwPyr

Oligopoly ^X4OHsYx5

Monopoly ^rwIpKYpN

Monopolistic
Competition ^sxCF0ZN1

Each market structure is characterised by:

The number of firms in the market: the more firms there are, the more competitive the market is.
This also includes the extent of competition from abroad.

The degree of product differentiation: The more differentiated the products, the less competitive
the market. In a perfectly competitive market, products are homogenous. Products can be
differentiated using price, branding and quality. This affects cross price of elasticity of demand.

Ease of entry into the market: This is the number and degree of the barriers to entry. Barriers
to entry. Barriers to entry are designed to prevent new firms entering the market profitability.
This increases producer surplus. The higher the barriers to entry, the less competitive the market. ^J46NLv0k
