Price discrimination, i.e. charging different prices for different consumers depending on certain criteria, has multiple benefits to firms and to consumers, but also involves drawbacks. Whilst it can be argued that said drawbacks outweigh the benefits, this essay shall argue otherwise: that the potential benefits for firms and consumers outweigh the risks and harmful elements of price discrimination, because it helps firms drive more business and aids those who need help in paying for certain goods.

Price discrimination is often argued to have a negative effect on the ‘normal’ consumer, i.e. the consumer of median age, median salary, with no extenuating health conditions, etc. This is because, often, these consumers are charged a higher price than those with extenuating circumstances. For example, entry into a theme park will often be more expensive for these consumers than it would be for, say, a child under 12 years old. Some economists argue that this leads to an inequitable distribution of income. However, it can be argued instead that the benefit that this provides to the firm and the consumer that the price discrimination is targeted at outweighs the damage done to the ‘normal’ consumer. Sticking with the example of theme parks, price discrimination in the form of lower prices for young children or families helps these families to afford entry to the theme park, and also, because prices are lower, drives demand for entry to the theme park by this demographic. This will benefit the firm’s profits: if the increase in demand outweighs the sacrifice in price, then the firm will have benefitted overall. The diagram below demonstrates this: a right shift in the demand curve from D1 to D2 as a result of lower prices causes the quantity to increase from Q1 to Q2, which demonstrates the increase in attendees that the theme park will see as a result of price discrimination. As a luxury good, theme park entry is price elastic, and so the decrease in price will cause a much larger increase in quantity demanded. Such an example of price discrimination in regular practise shows that, in this circumstance, the loss to the ‘normal’ consumer is far outweighed by the benefit to the firm and to the consumer that is targeted, and so it can be seen that price discrimination is not always damaging.

Similarly, price discrimination can aid those who need support. Take, for example, rail travel. in the UK, those under 25 and those above 65 are able to buy a railcard, which provides discounted rates. The discounts are justified by the fact that these age groups are more likely to be using public transport or not have the money to consume tickets. A reduction in price as a result of price discrimination will help the affected groups to increase their demand of train tickets, and thus achieve an equitable balance of resources. However, there is an argument to be made that firms may lose money on such concessionary schemes - the increase in demand may not be enough to supplement lost profit. In this case, it could be argued that price discrimination is, on the whole, damaging. However, this is often not the case, as in the case of rail travel where the government subsidises concessionary travel (this also applies to public transport across the country), meaning that firms are able to practise price discrimination without losing much profit. This gives support to the argument that price discrimination is not always damaging, because price discrimination in this way can help to reduce inequality by providing sometimes necessary services to those who otherwise could not afford them. This can be shown in the diagram below by a left shift in the Lorenz curve - the poorer in society will be given more of an advantage, and thus the curve will shift inwards towards perfect equality, giving the same amount of the population (P1) a higher share of income (an increase of N2-N1), as they will be relieved of the burden of buying necessities.

Firms also employ price discrimination to control demand. They can manipulate prices depending on the the time of day. For example, many eateries have ‘happy hours’ where food and drink will be cheaper. This ensures that the firm knows when a larger quantity of people will demand goods and services, and so they can maintain productive efficiency by, for example, employing more staff at that time. They can then release the staff after the busy period is over, continuing to fully employ their resources rather than having spare capacity. This is shown in the diagram below where the SRAC curve intersects with the MC curve. This is the point at which the firm is operating at full capacity (e.g. when all staff are working rather than being idle due to lack of traffic). However, there is a limitation to this type of price discrimination - a firm can never be productively efficient in monopolistic competition, which most firms that practise this type of price discrimination operate in. Thus, all this does is move firms slightly closer to productive efficiency without ever reaching it. Furthermore, time-based price discrimination, when enacted on a larger scale such as annually (e.g. Black Friday and holiday periods), firms can suffer from a cyclical cycle of profit - only making large profits at certain points of the year, and making normal profit to remain in the market at all other times. This can severely affect the profitability of the firm in the long-run. Despite this, benefits can still be seen, such as moving nearer to productive efficiency, the very possibility of which disproves the statement that price discrimination is always damaging.

In conclusion, despite some damaging effects of price discrimination on firms, it can be argued that price discrimination is not always damaging without exception. Consumers benefit substantially from it, and it promotes equality amongst different parts of society. Thus, we may conclude that, whilst it causes damage sometimes, price discrimination has a net benefit to consumers and to firms, and so should be employed when possible.
