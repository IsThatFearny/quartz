# Text Elements
Specialisation occurs when each worker completes a specific task in a production process. The concept was
famously stated by Adam Smith, who showed how, through the division of labour, worker productivity can
increase. Firms can then take advantage of increased efficiency and lower average costs of production.
Specialisation can be achieved by individuals, businesses, regions of countries, or countries themselves. ^7nrmNVnd

Specialisation and Division of Labour ^XjI32yKm

Advantages ^DSGXcrcL

- Higher output and potentially higher quality

- Greater variety of goods and services produced

- More opportunities for economies of scale, so the
  size of the market increases

- More competition, which gives an incentive for firms
  to lower their costs, which helps to keep prices down ^kkQ5EDt9

Countries can specialise in the production of certain goods. Countries trade to get the goods and services that
they are unable to produce. Countries can exploit their comparative advantage in a good, which means they can
produce a good at a lower opportunity cost to another. Absolute advantage occurs when a country can produce
more of a good with the same factor inputs. ^yuWjDO4E

Disadvantages ^HxSQEueQ

- Greater world output, leading to gains in economic
  welfare

- Lower average costs, since the market becomes
  more competitive

- Increased supply of goods to choose from

- Outward shift in the PPF curve ^kgNlr6Fa

Disadvantages ^CC30dkaO

- Work becomes repetitive, which could lower the motivation
  of workers, potentially affecting quality and productivity. 
  Workers could become dissatisfied

- There could be structural unemployment, since skills might 
  not be transferable

- Variety could decrease because only one good is produced

- Higher worker turnover ^7SFnMSHP

Advantages ^3O8uzMCY

- Less developed countries might use up their non-renewable
  too quickly, and so might run out

- Countries could become over-dependent on the export of
  one commodity, such as wheat. If there are poor weather
  conditions, or the price falls, then the economy would suffer ^bqyHz41y
