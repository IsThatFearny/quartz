Profit as an objective of firms ^clx1d6Xi

Profit is an important objective of most firms. Models that consider the traditional theory of the firm
are based upon the assumption that firms aim to maximise profits. However, firms can have other
objectives which affect how they behave. Profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost.
It is the reward that entrepreneurs yield when they take risks.

Firms break even when TR = TC.

A firm's profit is the difference between its total revenue (TR) and total costs (TC). A firm's profit
maximises when they are operating at the price and output which derives the greatest profit. Profit
maximisation occurs where marginal cost (MC) = marginal revenue (MR). In other words, each extra unit
produced gives no extra loss or no extra revenue.

Profits increase when MR > MC. profits decrease when MC > MR. ^XpPTvetn

Some firms choose to profit maximise because: it provides greater wages and dividends for entrepreneurs;
retained profits are a cheap source of finance, which saves paying high interest rates on loans; in the
short run, the interests of the owners or shareholders are most important, since they aim to maximise
their gain from the company; and some firms might profit maximise in the long run since consumers do not
like rapid price changes in the short run, so this will provide a stable price and output.

PLCs are particularly keen to profit maximise, because they could lose their shareholders if they do not
receive a high dividend. They are more likely to have short run profit maximisation as an objective,
because they need to keep their shareholders happy. ^nq7mofZ4
