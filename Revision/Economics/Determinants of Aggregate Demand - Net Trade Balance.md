Consumption + Investment + Gov. Spending + (Exports - Imports) ^mwbhmzWf

Determinants of Aggregate Demand - Net Trade Balance ^TQ3mAxuq

This is the value of the current account on the balance of payments. A positive value indicates a surplus, whilst
a negative value indicates a deficit. The UK has a relatively large trade deficit, which reduces the value of AD. ^ezDgldYQ

Influences on the balance of payments ^LObRP75p

Real income: During periods of economic growth, when consumers have higher incomes and they can afford to consume
more, there is a larger deficit on the current account. When consumers increase their spending, they consume more 
domestic products as well as more imports. During periods of economic decline, real incomes fall, and historically
this has led to improvements in the UK's current account.

Exchange rates: A depreciation of the pound means imports are cheaper, and exports are more expensive, so the
trade deficit narrows. Depreciations make the currency relatively more competitive against other currency, depending
on which currency the pound depreciates against - a larger effect is seen if it depreciates against a major currency.
The demand for UK exports has to be price elastic to lead to an increase in exports. ^1IdXcl8W

State of the world economy: A decline in economic growth in one of the UK's export markets means there will be a fall
in exports, because consumer spending in those economies will fall due to a fall in real incomes.

Degree of protectionism: This is the act of guarding a country's industries from foreign competition, such as tariffs,
quotas, regulations or embargoes. If the UK employed protectionist measures, then the trade deficit would be reduced,
because the UK will be importing less. However, since protectionism leads to retaliation, exports might decrease too,
which undoes the effect of reduced imports.

Non-Price Factors: The competitiveness of a country's goods and services, which is influenced by supply-side policies,
impacts how many exports the country has. A country can become more competitive through innovation, improvements in
quality, niche markets, lower labour costs, higher productivity, or improved infrastructure. This will increase exports.
Trade deals and membership of trading blocs can influence exports. This may open a country up to, or close a country
off from, significant export opporunities. ^0rg88NmW
