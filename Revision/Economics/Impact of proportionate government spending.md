Impact of proportionate government spending ^n8MDIiR4

Governments spend money on supply-side policies to improve human capital and boost long-run growth. Human capital
is important for competitiveness. The government could invest in youth apprentice schemes, for example, to make
people more employable and productive from a young age.

Education and training can mean higher value products can be made and productivity can be improved.

Fiscal policy aims to stimulate economic growth and stabilise the economy. The government could influence the size
of the circular flow by changing the government budget, and spending and taxes can be targeted in areas which
need stimulating. ^4gVSEy9z

Productivity and Growth ^7EvW1CTV

Crowding Out ^QlXYEhw0

Governments might have to fund its spending using taxes or running a budget deficit. This leaves fewer funds in the
private sector for firms to use, since the government is borrowing money, which crowds them out of the market. When
the government borrows a lot of money, interest rates might increase, which discourages spending and investment among
the private sector. This reduction is the 'crowding out' of investment. Sometimes, crowding out refers to the government
provision of a good or service, which would otherwise be provided by the private sector. ^aoTp8QdF

Level of Taxation ^sXDlevni

The tax rate might increase if the government debts get too high. If confidence is lost in the government's ability to
repay the debt, governments might have to raise interest rates to encourage investors to buy bonds, so that they can
finance the debt. It could lead to higher taxes and austerity measures, especially if the debt becomes uncontrollable.

In the UK, the size of government spending is about 40% of GDP. This means that citizens in the UK have a lower tax
burden than in a country such as Switzerland, where government spending is 60% of GDP. ^D77ALvmw

Equality and Living Standards ^0h5EHA9W

Progressive taxes could be used to reduce inequality, since the poorest in society pay the smallest proportion of their
income as tax. Redistributive measures and welfare payments could be used to help those on lowest incomes.

Also, government spending on housing and the provision of public services, such as education and healthcare, helps
provide equal opportunities for people from all income backgrounds. This ensures that even those on low incomes can afford
a good standard of healthcare and education. By providing these services, the government ensures that all members of
society can achieve a minimum standard of living.  ^hbVKvzJB
