Causes of Cyclical Instability Continued ^UBlOUUz0

Destabilising speculation and animal spirits ^1vJQgdPK

Destabilising speculation leads to changes in the price level in a market, as a result of
speculation. Speculators purchase assets when they believe the price is likely to appreciate.
Conversely, assets are sold when the price is believed to depreciate. This can affect the
actual price of assets in the economy. Keynes coined the term 'animal spirits' when
describing instincts and emotions of human behaviour, which drives the level of confidence in
an economy. If firms expect a high rate of return, they will invest more. Firms need to be
certain about the future, otherwise they will postpone their investments. Expectations about
society and politics could affect investment. For example, if a change in government might
happen, or if commodity prices are due to rise, businesses may postpone their investment decisions. ^IxAJYo38

Herding ^Mz52AbAE

Herding is the act of reacting to the behaviour of other economic agents rather than the market.
This might be because some investors think other economic agents are better informed about the
market, so they follow their actions. This can cause instability in the market. ^tpTehimN
