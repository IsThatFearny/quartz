# Policies to reduce emissions

### Subsidise sustainability

One solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to subsidise the use of sustainable resources and products involved in green practises. For example, the government could provide a subsidy in the purchase of paper bags for supermarkets. This would reduce the amount of plastic, polluting bags that the supermarkets would use, because the cost of their substitute, paper bags, has decreased. A subsidy prevents the higher costs associated with certain sustainable resources from being passed on to consumers, and therefore firms are incentivised to use these resources (as they will not lose out on profit). The diagram below demonstrates this: the subsidy provided is shown in a shift in the supply curve from S1 to S2, bringing the price down from P1 to P2, and increasing the quantity from Q1 to Q2.

However, there are limitations to the use of subsidies. Firstly, because they are provided by the government, funding a subsidy will lead to an increase in government spending. This may be financed by excess borrowing, which will increase the budget deficit, or by using increased taxation, which will cause a welfare loss to consumers. The government must also weigh up the extent to which taxation will affect the consumer as opposed to how the effects of climate change will, so as to avoid government intervention. This may require costly research.

### Indirect Taxation

Levying an indirect tax on good which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions will reduce consumption. This is because the price of the good will increase, causing demand to decrease because consumers will not want to spend more money on the good. Firms are left with two options: to reduce the price of the good to bring demand back into equilibrium; or to use more sustainable resources to make their good so as to avoid the indirect tax and maintain profits (or at the very least, prevent further loss). This can be seen on the diagram below, where a shift in the demand curve occurs from D1 to D2. Firms will have to reduce price by P2 - P1 to maintain profits and prevent further loss.
