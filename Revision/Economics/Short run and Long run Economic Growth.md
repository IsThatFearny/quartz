Short run and Long run Economic Growth ^UdCWOD82

Short run growth is the percentage increase in a country's real GDP and it is
usually measured annually. It is caused by increases in AD.

Long run economic growth occurs when the productive capacity of the economy
is increasing and it refers to the trend rate of growth of real national output
in an economy over time. It is caused by increases in AS.

The potential output of an economy is what the economy could produce if
resources were fully employed. ^odW8j6Im
