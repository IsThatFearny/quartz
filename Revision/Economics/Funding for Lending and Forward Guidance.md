Funding for Lending and Forward Guidance ^tFf8lkJL

Worsening conditions in the Euro area meant that UK banks were faced with higher funding
costs. In order to support them, the government introduced the funding for lending scheme,
which aimed to lower these costs and provide cheaper funding to banks and building societies.


Forward guidance is used by central banks to detail what the future monetary policy will be
to the general public. This is with the intention of reducing uncertainty in markets. For example,
the MPC might state that they will keep the interest rate at a certain level until a specified
level. ^CvLmi0E2
