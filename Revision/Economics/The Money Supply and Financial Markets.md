# Text Elements
The money supply is the stock of currency and liquid assets in an economy. It includes cash and money
held in savings accounts. Narrow money is the physical currency (notes and coins), as well as deposits
and liquid assets in the central bank. Broad money includes the entire money supply. Cash could be in
restricted accounts, which makes it hard to calculate the money supply. It includes liquid and less
liquid assets.

In the money market, liquid assets are traded. It is used to borrow and lend money in the short term.
The capital market is where equity and debt instruments are bought and sold. These can then be put
to long-term productive use by firms and governments. The Foreign Exchange (FOREX) market is where
currencies are traded, mainly by international banks. It determines what the relative value of different
currencies will be. ^HPG79wTH
