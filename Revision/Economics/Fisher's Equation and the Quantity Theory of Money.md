Fisher's Equation and the Quantity Theory of Money ^myeWUwZ9

The Quantity Theory of Money states that there is inflation if the money supply increases at a faster
rate than national income. Fisher's equation of exchange is:



T can be used instead of Q, although using Q means that PQ is nominal national income and overcomes
the difficulties associated with the inclusion of intermediate transactions. M refers to the supply of
money, V is the velocity of circulation, P is the price level, and Q is the quantity of real goods sold 
(real GDP). T represents transactions, however this is difficult to measure. Therefore, the value
of total expenditure on goods equals the value of total output. ^Xvv3ABij

MV = PQ ^1XS6y4R9

The equation assumes that velocity is constant, and that Q is independent of the supply of money.
Only supply-side factors affect Q. It is assumed that V is constant because the frequency that
workers are paid does not change often. The equation argues that increasing the money supply causes
inflation.

When the money supply increases, consumers have more money to spend. This causes AD to shift to the
right. Firms then increase supply in the short run. A positive output gap occurs, which is inflationary. As
a result, more workers are employed, so wages increase. This means costs increase for firms, so they
increase prices. This inflationary pressure means the real value of money falls. Since money can buy less,
there is a contraction in demand. Workers demand higher wages to make up for the increase in inflation.
This leads to a left shift in the SRAS curve. The output in the economy returns to equilibrium, but the
price level is higher. ^AlESD31V
