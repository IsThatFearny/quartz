| Transport currently contributes to the highest amount of emissions in 2017 - 125.9, compared to the next highest which is from Energy at 112.6 | Other areas of the industry have been focused on recently, such as energy supply, which has decreased from 277.9 to 112.6 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e |
| Transport has remained relatively static, showing that not much focus has been given to transport throughout time                              |                                                                                                                                             |
| Making public transport more accessible and cheaper prevents the emissions from lots of cars on the roads                                      |                                                                                                                                             |
