Balance of Payments Disequilibrium ^HmQQKv5a

A current account surplus means that there is a net inflow of money into the circular flow of
income. The UK has a surplus with services, but a deficit with goods. The UK has a net current
account deficit. This means the UK spends more on imports from foreign countries than they earn
from exports to foreign countries. If the deficit is large and runs for a long time, there could be
financial difficulties with financing the deficit.


- Appreciation of the currency: A stronger currency means imports are cheaper and exports are
  relatively more expensive, which means the current account deficit could worsen.

- Economic growth: when consumer incomes increase, demand increases. This could increase demand
  for imports. This is especially true of countries where consumers have a high propensity to import.
  
- More competitive: if a country becomes more internationally  competitive, such as with lower
  inflation or if there is economic growth in export markets, exports should increase. This also
  occurs when a country becomes more productive, since that causes average unit costs to fall.
  This could cause the current account deficit to improve, or increase the current account
  surplus.

- Deindustrialisation: in the UK, the manufacturing sector has been declining since the 1970s. The
  goods that the UK previously made domestically now have to be imported, which worsens the deficit.

- Membership of trade unions: the UK has traditionally had negative current transfers, since fees
  are paid for membership of the EU

- Attractiveness to foreign investors: A capital account surplus could be caused by incoming finance
  from investors buying UK bonds, securities, and financial derivatives. This could help fund a current
  account deficit. ^GUBOzhGV
