Economies and Diseconomies of Scale ^ZIodBzGe

Internal Economies of Scale ^YvsvAWub

Internal economies of scale occur when a firm becomes larger. Average
costs of production fall as output increases.

Risk bearing: When a firm becomes larger, they can expand their production
range. Therefore, they can spread the cost of uncertainty. If one part is
not successful, they have other parts to fall back on.

Financial: Banks are willing to lend loans more cheaply to larger firms, because
they are deemed less risky. Therefore larger firms can take advantage of
cheaper credit.

Managerial: Larger firms are more able to specialise and divide their labour.
They can employ specialist managers, which lowers average costs.

Technological: Larger firms can afford to invest in more advanced and
productive capital, which will lower their average costs.

Marketing: Larger firms can divide their marketing budgets across larger outputs,
so the average cost of advertising per unit is less than that of a smaller firm

Purchasing: Larger firms can bulk-buy, which means each unit will cost them less.

Network: gained from the expansion of ecommerce. Large online shops can add extra
goods and customers at a very low cost.

External Economies of Scale ^rBhVBG5c

These occur within the industry. For example, local roads might
be improved, son transport costs for the local industries will
fall. Also, there might be more training facilities or more research
and development, which will also lower average costs for firms in
the local area. ^5z8ahjc2

Diseconomies of Scale ^rNlzLvCY

These occur when output passes a certain point and average costs
start to increase per extra unit of output produced.

Control: It becomes harder to monitor how productive the workforce is,
as the firm becomes larger

Coordination: It is harder and complicated to coordinate every worker
when there are thousands of employees.

Communication: Workers may start to feel alienated and excluded as
the firm grows. This could lead to falls in productivity and increases
in average costs, as they lose their motivation. ^cGxlSGXf
