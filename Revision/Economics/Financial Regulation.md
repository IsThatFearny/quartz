Financial Regulation ^bGUQ4j7Z

Governments might regulate banks with regulation and guidelines. This helps to ensure that the
behaviour of banks is clear to institutions and individuals who conduct business with the bank.

Some economists argue that the banks have a huge influence in the economy; if they failed it
would have huge consequences. Therefore, it is important to regulate the banking industry.

The UK banking industry is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The FCA regulates financial firms to ensure that they
are being honest to consumers and they seek to protect consumer interests. The FCA also
aims to promote competition, which is in the interests of consumers. The PRA promotes the
safety and stability of banks, building societies, investment firms, and credit unions, and 
ensures policyholders are protected.

The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) regulates risk in banking and ensures that the financial
system is stable. It clamps down on unregulated parts and loose credit. The committee monitors
overall risks to the financial system as well as regulating individual groups. ^ksHgYiTn
