# Text Elements
Objectives of a commercial bank and conflict between objectives ^a57aP1u5

The liquidity of assets is how easy it is to turn the assets into cash. Liabilities are payable on demand, so in
order to be profitable banks must have cash and liquid assets. If liquidity is prioritised, profits will be low, so banks
need a balance between the two objectives.

Assets in commercial banks are liquid to different extents. Cash is the most liquid asset, whilst deposits are the next
most liquid. Loans and long-term bonds are the least liquid assets in a commercial bank.

If banks can borrow easily and cheaply, they are likely to keep fewer liquid assets. The more expensive and difficult it is
to get a loan, the more liquid assets are likely to be kept. ^eD2NGxYZ

Liquidity ^74QhF2tB

Profitability ^ssqjCAkb

Banks need to earn profits to pay their depositors interest, wages, and general expenses. Holding a lot of funds in cash
means profitability is limited. However, liquidity and safety are generally prioritised over profitability, which is considered to
be a supplementary for the bank's survival. ^CtoQVZs8

Security ^Ad0pNL02

Banks face risks and uncertainties about how much cash they can get, and whether loans will be repaid or not. Banks
therefore have to try and maintain the safety of their assets. A bank has to keep high proportions of their liabilities
with itself and the central bank. However, following these principles means that banks only hold their safest assets, so more
credit cannot be created. This means that banks' profits are lower and the bank might lose customers. The bank needs a
balance between the risk level and their profits. Too much risk could be harmful ^85lfItmE
