# Text Elements
The Functions of Money ^CCKajjq6

A medium of exchange ^sEcMMC47

Without money, transaction were conducted through bartering. Goods and services were traded
with other goods and services, but people did not always get exactly what they wanted or
needed. The goods and services exchanged were not always of the same value, which also
posed a problem. Exchange could only take place if there was a double coincidence of wants.
Using money eliminates this problem. ^d3etLxpR

A store of value ^vTQ0yn3K

Money has to hold its value to be used for payment. It can be kept for a long time without
expiring. However, the quantity of goods and services that can be bought with money fluctuates
slightly with the forces of supply and demand. ^hQHEZW45

Money can allow for debts to be created. People can therefore pay for things without having
money in the present, and can pay for them later. This relies on money storing its value. ^NLNti12u

A measure of value ^C2QE7qJE

Money provides a means to ensure the relative values of different goods and services. For
example, a piece of jewellery might be considered more valuable than a table because of the
relative price, measured by money. Money also puts a value on labour. ^oEXUpC0r

A method of deferred payment ^rASD4XI0
