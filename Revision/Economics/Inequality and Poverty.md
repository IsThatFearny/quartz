# Inequality and Poverty

</br>

#### Definitions

**Equity:** fair treatment according to circumstances

**Equality:** fair treatment no matter the circumstances of the individual

**Income Inequality:** The difference between incomes of the rich and the poor

**Wealth inequality:** The difference in net worth between the rich and the poor

</br>

#### How can poverty be measured?

The World Bank’s international poverty line is below $2.15 USD per day. If someone lives below this line, then they are considered to be in poverty internationally. This can be done by taking surveys with large sample sizes, taking averages of certain areas, etc.

**Difficulties with measuring poverty?:** Not everyone in poverty can be surveyed, or accessed to take down statistics. International poverty levels do not take into account per-country/per-region circumstances, such as development of infrastructure and public services

</br>

#### Absolute vs Relative Poverty

**Relative Poverty/Low Income:** Households with income below 60% of the median in that year

**Absolute Poverty/Low Income:** Households with income below 60% of the median in a base year (adjusted for inflation)

</br>

#### Causes of Poverty, UK and Sri Lanka

**UK:** High unemployment, preventing people from being able to bring in any income and keeping them below the poverty line; poor education, preventing people from earning high wages and forcing them into unskilled, low-wage jobs; inability to work due to health issues, where benefits may not be enough to keep people above the poverty line

**Sri Lanka:** Poor infrastructure and welfare system; primary employment in agriculture, which is a very volatile and unprofitable industry; lack of generational opportunity and poor upbringing

</br>

#### Gini Coefficients, UK and Sri Lanka

**UK:** 32.4

**Sri Lanka:** 37.7

#### Reducing inequality and poverty through taxation

**Progressive tax:** As incomes rise, a higher proportion of income is paid in tax (e.g. increasing the top tax bracket of the UK tax system). This will decrease the gap between the poor and the rich because the rich pay proportionally more

**Regressive tax:** As incomes rise, the proportion of income paid in tax decreases. This will increase inequality, as the rich will keep more of their money than those that are poorer

**Proportional tax:** Tax is levied proportionally no matter the income level, e.g. 20% tax no matter whether someone is making £24,000 a year or £500,000 a year

**Direct taxes:** Direct taxes can lower inequality and poverty because, generally, they affect the richer in society (e.g. the UK’s tax system)

**Indirect taxes:** Indirect taxes (e.g. VAT) have a bigger effect on the poorer in society, because they take up a higher proportion of their income
