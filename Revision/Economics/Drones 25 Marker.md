In recent years, worldwide sales of drones have increased exponentially, being purchased for all manner of purposes. However, there have been multiple incidents which have brought into question whether their utility is worth the risk. This essay shall analyse the advantages and disadvantages of drones, and whether the current regulation that is in place is too restrictive, sufficient, or not restrictive enough. It shall be determined that drones should be encouraged, as long as regulation is present to prevent issues.

Drones can be used for a wide variety of purposes, and often bring about positive externalities in consumption (where net benefit to society is greater than the benefit to private individuals). Extract F gives the example of drones used for humanitarian purposes. One firm has developed drones which can carry emergency supplies to areas suffering from humanitarian disasters. These can carry 50 kilos of food, which can feed up to 50 people per day. This is clearly a positive aspect of drone usage. Here, the Marginal Social Benefit (MSB) outweighs the Marginal Private Benefit (MPB), because wider society benefits more than the individual. This is demonstrated on the diagram below. The net benefit to society can be seen in the shaded area. Drones can also be used to protect humans. Often, humanitarian organisations or military personnel have to go into war zones or dangerous areas to provide aid. This carries inherent risks (exemplified by the bombing of the World Central Kitchen volunteers in Gaza recently). Because drones can be used remotely, the risk to human life is almost entirely removed. Furthermore, there have been trials by Amazon to use drones to deliver short-range parcels, which significantly reduces costs for firms, allowing them to increase supply. This is represented on the below diagram by an outward shift in the Supply curve from S1 to S2, causing an increase in Quantity from Q1 to Q2. This also lowers the price level for the consumer from P1 to P2. However, this may also have negative consequences. Replacing delivery drivers with drones may cause increased unemployment in the industry, which will lead to a net welfare loss for the workers. Whilst it can be argued that these delivery drivers could be employed to fly the drones, or to repair and maintain them, this relies on a lack of occupational immobility: as delivery driving is a relatively unskilled job, it may be difficult and costly to train these workers to do these jobs, or to transfer their existing skills. Training costs such as these may increase costs, reducing supply to S3. However, overall, the net benefit is positive, and so drones can be said to be advantageous in this scenario.

There are, however, also numerous downsides to the use of drones. Extract F makes reference to a cost of £50 million to the air travel industry after 1000 flights were cancelled due to the presence of drones near Gatwick airport in 2018. This was out of fear of collision between planes and drones, the rate of which has been increasing every year from 2014-2018. This could pose substantial risk to those on board planes. This is a negative externality in consumption, which is represented on the diagram below by the Marginal Private Benefit outweighing Marginal Social Benefit. The risk to those flying (i.e. the net welfare loss) is demonstrated by the shaded area. In addition to this, concerns have been raised over privacy, as drones can access areas which are usually off-limits. This will also cause a net welfare loss, as shown in the diagram. There have been suggestions, however, that drone frequency blocking technology could be employed to prevent this. The production of drones causes negative externalities as well. They require rare earth metals for their computer systems, and lithium for their batteries. The exploitation and gathering of these materials is carbon-intensive, causing damage to the environment, and those who work for the companies that supply these raw materials are often underpaid, treated unfairly, and generally exploited. This causes negative externalities in production, represented on the diagram below by Marginal Social Cost outweighing Marginal Private Cost. This can, however, be mitigated by ensuring good practise in purchasing raw materials, and government regulation to prevent exploitation. These disadvantages are certainly important to consider, however the previously discussed positive externalities outweigh the negative externalities, and so we can conclude that governments should encourage the use of drones.

In conclusion, governments should encourage the use of drones, because they have a net benefit on society. The issues that they bring can largely be mitigated with correct government intervention - laws on privacy and spying with drones, legislation surrounding sustainability of production processes, and rules on where people can fly drones (as well as anti-drone technology) must be sufficient to decrease the social cost of drones even further. As long as this is done, drones should be widely encouraged to increase the effect of positive externalities.
