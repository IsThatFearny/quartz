Monetary Policy Instruments - Quantitative Easing ^NUK09nKW

This is used by banks to help stimulate the economy when standard monetary policy is no longer effective. 
The Bank of England electronically creates more money, and uses this to buy government and banks bonds.

As banks now have more money, they will naturally lend more to households and firms, thus increasing overall 
demand which will restimulate the economy. This assumes banks will not simply sit on the cash, which they may 
do if concerned about their clients' abilities to repay loans.

Now that the central bank has also bought up government bonds (gilts), the government has the funds to spend 
more in the economy in the hopes of boosting it.

Alternatively, if the Bank of England wants to initiate contractionary monetary policy, they will stop the purchase 
of bonds. This means that banks will hold back on lending and governments will delay spending on infrastructure. 
This will reduce the overall rate of inflation. ^9QsI2ogL

Limitations of Quantitative Easing ^b3aunbCw

As the supply of the pound increases, the UK experiences a depreciation of its currency on FOREX markets.
Although this makes exports cheaper, imports become more expensive, and because the UK imports a lot of raw
materials from overseas, it could trigger cost-push inflation.

QE also lowers long-term interest rates, because the supply of money has increased. This makes bonds less
attractive to potential investors, as the rate of return is lower, so without anyone buying government bonds,
there is less investment in the country which prevents the productive capacity of an economy from expanding. ^wlF1HWTo
