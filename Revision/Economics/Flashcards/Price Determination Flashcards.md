#### Competitive markets

<!--ID: 1711964131104-->

#### Complementary goods
Goods in joint demand; these goods are often bought together, e.g.

<!--ID: 1711964131108-->

#### Composite demand
Demand for a multi-purpose good.
<!--ID: 1711964131112-->

#### Condition of demand

position of the good's demand curve.
<!--ID: 1711964131115-->

#### Condition of supply
A determinant of supply other than the good's price, that sets the
position of the good's supply curve.
<!--ID: 1711964131119-->

#### Customer sovereignty
Consumers can collectively govern production in a market via

The price where planned demand matches planned supply.
<!--ID: 1711964131173-->

<!--ID: 1711964131180-->

<!--ID: 1711964131205-->

#### Inferior good
A good for which demand rises as incomes fall.
<!--ID: 1711964131213-->

<!--ID: 1711964131219-->

#### Normal good
A good for which demand rises as incomes rise.
<!--ID: 1711964131226-->

Measures the responsiveness of a good's supply to a change in
price.
<!--ID: 1711964131232-->

<!--ID: 1711964131237-->
