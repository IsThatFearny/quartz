# Quantity Theory of Money


**Increases in the money supply will lead to increases in the price level**

- The monetarist theory is that there is too much money chasing too few goods.

- Increases in the money supply lead to increases in AD, which lead to increases in the price level

#### The Fisher Equation

The Fisher Equation lies at the heart of the Monetarist theory:

$$MV = PT$$
M is the amount of money in circulation; V is the velocity of transactions; P is the average price of each transaction; and T (or Q) is transactions/output in a period of time. The right hand side of the formula involves the nominal national income/value of output.

**Monetarist Assumptions:**

- Velocity of circulation is predictable and assumed to be constant
- Transactions/output is assumed to be constant

Any increase in the money supply will create the same percentage increase in the price level. This leads monetarists to believe that the money supply must be strictly controlled.
