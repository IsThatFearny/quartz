Functions of a Central Bank ^KZcBw0nX

The central bank manages the currency, money supply and interest rates in an economy.
Central banks issue physical cash securely and use methods to prevent forgery, so that
people trust the money. The central bank can regulate bank lending to ensure that there
is stability in the financial system. ^wu6uCoUZ

Banker to the government ^UlFWKXxl

The central bank provides services to the government. It collects payments to governments
and makes payments on behalf of the government. It maintains and operates deposit
accounts of the government. The central bank also manages public debt and issues loans.

The bank can also advise the government on finance, including the timing and terms of new loans. ^YPzxo8GL

Banker to the banks ^tPUYR1kU

The Bank of England is considered to be a 'lender of last resort'. If there is no other method
to increase the supply of liquidity when it is low, the bank will lend money to increase this supply.

If an institution is risky or close to collapsing, the bank might lend to them if they have no other
way of borrowing money.

The bank can protect individuals who deposit funds in a bank and might otherwise lose them. It
also aims to prevent a 'run on the bank', when consumers all withdraw deposits at once, because
they fear that the bank will collapse.

Usually, banks will avoid borrowing from the lender of last resort, because it suggests to the
government that the bank is experiencing financial difficulties and won't display confidence to their
depositors. ^RfUdhnCm
