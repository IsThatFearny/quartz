# Text Elements
Characteristics of Perfect Competition ^WccSzCLt

- Many buyers and sellers
- Sellers are price-takers
- Free entry to and exit from the market
- Perfect information
- Homogenous goods
- Firms are short-run profit maximisers
- Factors of production are perfectly mobile

In this market, price is determined by the interaction of supply and demand. In a competitive market,
profits are likely to be lower than a market with only a few large firms. This is because each firm in
a competitive market has a very small market share, which means that their market power is very
small. If firms make a profit, then new firms will enter the market, due to low barriers to entry,
because the market seems profitable. The new firms will increase supply in the market, which lowers the
average price. This means that the existing firms' profits will be competed away. ^dqKCIeKh
