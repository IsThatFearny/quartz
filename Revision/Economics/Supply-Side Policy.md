Advantages and Disadvantages
of Supply-Side Policy ^3yKDh9Vn

Supply-side policies aim to improve the long run productive potential of the economy. The economy
can experience supply-side improvements in the private sector, without government intervention.
For example, there could be improvements in productivity, innovation, and investment. ^MrYpun0O

Strengths and Weaknesses of Supply-side policy ^4p7zn92U

Supply-side policies are the only policies which can deal with structural unemployment, because the
labour market can be directly improved with education and training.

Demand-side policies are better at dealing with cyclical unemployment, since they can reduce the
size of a negative-output gap and shift the AD curve to the right.

There are significant time lags associated with supply-side policies.

Market-based supply-side policies, such as reducing the rate of tax, could lead to a more unequal
distribution of wealth. ^rSnF8Nex
