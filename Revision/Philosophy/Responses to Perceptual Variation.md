Responses to Perceptual Variation ^jxf7eoH2

Just because we don't always see a single colour does not show that Direct Realism is false, and we
can still say that we see the table and its colour under normal conditions. In seeing its colour, as some
variant of brown, we see the table and its properties. In terms of shape, we have an even better reason
to claim that the table is rectangular rather than obtuse - we can use its shape to perform various
actions - we can only get a table through a narrow door if is rectangular rather than obtuse. ^Q86e6luN

A relational property is a property that something has only in relation to something else. For example, 'being
north of' is a relational property. We can only say what this property is by mention of two separate
subjects.

Having established the concept of relational properties, we can apply this to perception. We can be aware of
a range of properties, some of which the object has independent of our minds, and some of which it has in
relation to being perceived. A rectangular table has the property of 'looking obtuse'. This property is
distinct from 'being obtuse', and so a table can be rectangular and look obtuse. The property of 'looking
obtuse' is a relational property.

Direct Realism can therefore claim that in perceiving physical objects, some of the properties we perceive
are relational properties while others are not. It doesn't have to claim that all the properties of physical
objects are mind-independent as long as there is a clear sense in which we are directly aware of physical
objects themselves. ^FqYZ9PwS
