Virtue Epistemology - Zagzebski ^9eFKdi65

1. p is true,
2. you believe that p, and
3. your belief is a result of you 
exercising your ‘epistemic’ or ‘intellectual’
virtues. ^OGTqFr9P

Virtue Epistemology argues that knowledge is a form of achievement
for which we deserve credit. It focuses on the agent and their
actions in forming their beliefs ^dpdWk5Cb

What is a virtue? ^pDqBKdnE

A virtue is a state of a person that is good by way of
helping the person achieve some good purpose or goal. Moral
virtues aim at moral goods such as wellbeing. Zagzebski defines
a virtue as having two components

1) A virtue motivates us to pursue what is good, e.g. in the case
of knowledge, we are motivated to seek truth

2) A virtue gives us the ability to be reliable in forming true beliefs

 ^Kt3cNL03

Someone who has an intellectual virtue will reliably believe what is
true, but not always. While a belief that is the product of a person 
exercising their virtues is epistemically good, it is not completely good
if it is false. Similarly, it is not completely good if the belief
is only accidentally true.

The morally best action will be the one that aims to help, succeeds,
and does so as a result of acting in the way that a virtuous person
would act. ^EeupTCJ2
