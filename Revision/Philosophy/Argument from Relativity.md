# Argument from Relativity
</br>

- Different societies and cultures have different moral codes (However this does not show that there is no objective morality)
- This fact reveals something about the nature of moral discourse, namely that moral judgements reflect a society’s way of life
- Realists claim that different moral codes are all ways of getting at the Truth
- Morality is a different discipline from science - it is not a course of ongoing discovery; it does not change according to new evidence. A more satisfactory explanation of moral relativity is that it arises from different ways of life, and changes according to society’s needs
- The **realist response:** all societies share general codes or principles e.g. don’t kill the innocent
- **Mackie replies:** at best, this shows that there are some objective fundamental morality principles; moral judgements are still relative. Most people experience morality as intuition, and this differs according to upbringing and experience

#### Criticisms

- Mackie presents an argument based on ‘how people think’ but moral realism is presenting what morality is. What is morally acceptable/permissible is not the same as what is morally right
- Moore’s intuition is not ‘gut reaction’ but a reasoned process, and this is how most people experience morality. We have intuitions about fundamental principles and then debate and draw our moral rules and judgements from thse.
- Mackie misunderstands the realist claim: an objective moral truth can be circumstantial
