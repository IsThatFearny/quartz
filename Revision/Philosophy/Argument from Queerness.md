# Argument from Queerness

- If moral properties exist, then they must be unlike any other property. They are not factual properties, but also motivational ones.
- How can objective/factual properties be motivational ones? Just to know e.g. ‘the world is spherical’ is not to be motivated to act in any way
- Moral properties are not natural properties - they are not discovered by scientific endeavour and are intrinsically motivating, so they must be non-natural if they exist
- If some actions have moral properties, e.g. murder has the moral property of being wrong, how can we know this? We cannot empirically test or reason to this knowledge
- Intuition suggests a special way of gaining this knowledge but it does not actually explain how this knowledge is gained
- Arguably, there are other propositions which face the same issue, e.g. maths and necessary truths. Mackie’s argument is an empiricist one
