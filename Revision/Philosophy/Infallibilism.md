Infallibilism ^JX6OZe6i

Gettier makes the assumption that Smith's beliefs are justified. However, it can be argued that Smith's reasons
 are not sufficient for justification.

Infallibilism avoids Gettier Cases altogether by bridging the gap between truth and knowledge, making it near impossible
for justification to exist without certainty or truth. ^Uej0bdfb

However, it is rare justification rules out any possible errors, and infallibilism entails that we have very little knowledge. 
Knowledge is more than just certainty. In addition, infallibilism does not seem to contrast between the statements 
'S is not mistaken' and 'S cannot possibly be mistaken'. It therefore commits the fallacy of equivocation. ^HNIIbcjp

Objection ^I7clkCGu
