# Arguments - P1, P2, C1, etc.

</br>

### Omniscience and free will

P1. For me to do an action freely, I must be able to do it or refrain from doing it. 

P2. If God knows what I will do before I do it, then it must be true that I will do that action. 

C1. Therefore, it cannot be true that God knows what I will do before I do it and be true that I don’t do that action. 

P3. If it is true that I will do that action, then nothing I can do can prevent it from coming true in the future that I am doing that action. 

C2. Therefore, if God knows what I will do before I do it, then I cannot refrain from doing that action in the future. 

C3. Therefore, if God knows what I will do before I do it, then that action is not free.

</br>

## Ontological Arguments

### Anselm’s ontological argument

P1. By definition, God is a being greater than which cannot be
conceived.

P2. (We can coherently conceive of such a being, i.e. the concept is
coherent.)

P3. It is greater to exist in reality than to exist only in the mind.

C1. Therefore, God must exist.

</br>

### Descartes’ ontological argument

(P1. I have the idea of God.) 

P2. The idea of God is the idea of a supremely perfect being. 

P3. A supremely perfect being does not lack any perfection. 

P4. Existence is a perfection. 

C1. Therefore, God exists.

</br>

### Objection to ontological arguments from Hume’s fork

P1. Nothing that is distinctly conceivable implies a contradiction. 

P2. Whatever we conceive as existent, we can also conceive as nonexistent. 

C1. Therefore, there is no being whose non-existence implies a contradiction.

</br>

### Kant’s objection: Existence is not a predicate

P1. If ‘God does not exist’ is a contradiction, then ‘God exists’ is an analytic truth. 

P2. If ‘God exists’ is an analytic truth, then EXISTENCE is part of the concept GOD. 

P3. Existence is not a predicate, something that can be added on to another concept. 

C1. Therefore, EXISTENCE is not part of the concept GOD. 

C1. Therefore, ‘God exists’ is not an analytic truth. 

C2. Therefore, ‘God does not exist’ is not a contradiction. 

C3. Therefore, we cannot deduce the existence of God from the concept of God. 

C4. Therefore, ontological arguments cannot prove that God exists.

</br>

### Malcolm’s ontological argument

P1. Either God exists or God does not exist. 

P2. God cannot come into existence or go out of existence. 

P3. If God exists, God cannot cease to exist. C1. Therefore, if God exists, God’s existence is necessary. 

P4. If God does not exist, God cannot come into existence. 

C2. Therefore, if God does not exist, God’s existence is impossible. 

C3. Therefore, God’s existence is either necessary or impossible.

P5. God’s existence is impossible only if the concept of God is selfcontradictory. 

P6. The concept of God is not self-contradictory. 

C4. Therefore, God’s existence is not impossible. 

C5. Therefore (from C3 + C4), God exists necessarily.

</br>

## Design arguments

### Design argument from analogy

P1. In ‘the fitting of means to ends’, nature resembles the products of human design.

P2. Similar effects have similar causes. 

P3. The cause of the products of human design is an intelligent mind that intended the design. 

C1. Therefore, the cause of nature is an intelligent mind that intended the design.

</br>

### Paley’s Design argument

P1. Anything that has parts organised to serve a purpose is designed. 

P2. Nature contains things which have parts that are organised to serve a purpose. 

C1. Therefore, nature contains things which are designed. 

P3. Design can only be explained in terms of a designer. 

P4. A designer must be or have a mind and be distinct from what is designed. 

C2. Therefore, nature was designed by a mind that is distinct from nature. 

C3. Therefore, such a mind (‘God’) exists.

</br>

### Swinburne’s Design argument

P1. There are some temporal regularities, e.g. related to human actions, that are explained in terms of persons.

P2. There are other temporal regularities, e.g. related to the operation of the laws of nature, that are similar to those explained in terms of persons.

C1. So we can, by analogy, explain the regularities relating to the operation of the laws of nature in terms of persons.

P3. There is no scientific explanation of the operation of the laws of nature.

P4. (As far as we know, there are only two types of explanation – scientific and personal.) 

C2. Therefore, there is no better explanation of the regularities relating to the operation of the laws of nature than the explanation in terms of persons. 

C3. Therefore, the regularities relating to the operation of the laws of nature are produced by a person. 

C4. Therefore, such a person, who can act on the entire universe, exists.

</br>

## Cosmological arguments and objections

### The Kalam argument

P1. The universe is composed of temporal phenomena – things that occur and exist in time – that are preceded by other temporal phenomena that are ordered in time. 

P2. An infinite regress of temporal phenomena is impossible.

C1. Therefore, the universe must have a beginning. 

P3. Everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence. 

C2. Therefore, there is a cause of the existence of the universe.

</br>

### Aquinas’ Second Way

P1. We find, in the world, (sustaining) causes and effects.

P2. Nothing can causally depend on itself. (To do so, it would have to have the power to sustain its own existence, but for that, it would already have to exist.) 

P3. (Sustaining) causes follow in (logical) order: the first causally sustains the second, which causally sustains the third, etc. (Think of nuclear fusion sustaining sunlight sustaining plant growth.) P4. If you remove a cause, you remove its effect. 

C1. Therefore, if there is no first cause, i.e. a sustaining cause that does not causally depend on any other cause, there will be no other causes. 

P5. If there is an infinite regress of causes, there is no first cause. 

C2. Therefore, given that there are (sustaining) causes, there cannot be an infinite regress of causes. 

C3. Therefore, there must be a first cause, which is not itself caused. 

P6. God is the first cause. 

C4. Therefore, God exists.

</br>

### Aquinas’ First Way

P1. Some things in the world undergo change. 

P2. Whatever changes is changed by something, i.e. change is caused. The cause must be something else. Something potential can only be made actual by something that is already actual. A property can’t cause itself to exist. 

P3. If A is changed by B, and B is changed, then B must have been changed by something else again. 

P4. If this goes on to infinity, then there is no first cause of change. 

P5. To remove a cause is to remove its effect. 

P6. Therefore, if there is no first cause of change, then there are no other causes of change, and so nothing changes. 

C1. Therefore, there must be a first cause of change, i.e. something that causes change but is not itself changed. 

P7. The first cause of change is God. 

C2. Therefore, God exists.

</br>

### Descartes Cosmological Argument

P1. If I cause my own existence, I would give myself all perfections (omnipotence, omniscience, etc.). 

P2. I do not have all perfections. 

C1. Therefore, I am not the cause of my existence.

P3. A lifespan is composed of independent parts, such that my existing at one time does not entail or cause my existing later. 

C2. Therefore, some cause is needed to keep me in existence. My existence is not uncaused. 

P4. I do not have the power to cause my continued existence through time. 

C3. Therefore, I depend on something else to exist. P5. I am a thinking thing and I have the idea of God. 

P6. There must be as much reality in the cause as in the effect. 

C4. Therefore, what caused me must be a thinking thing and have the idea of God. 

P7. Either what caused me is the cause of its own existence or its existence is caused by another cause. 

P8. If its existence is caused by another cause, then its cause is in turn either the cause of its own existence or its existence is caused by another cause. 

P9. There cannot be an infinite sequence of causes. 

C5. Therefore, some cause must be the cause of its own existence. 

P10. What is the cause of its own existence (and so, directly or indirectly, the cause of my existence) is God. 

C6. God exists. 

C2. Some cause is needed to keep me in existence.

P11. There cannot be an infinite chain of causes because what caused me also causes my continued existence in the present.

P12. My parents, or any other supposed (temporal) cause of my existence, do not keep me in existence. (They are not a sustaining cause.) 

P10. The only cause that could keep me in existence is God. 

C6. God exists.

</br>

### Aquinas’ Third Way

P1. Things in the universe exist contingently. 

P2. If it is possible for something not to exist, then at some time, it does not exist. 

C1. If everything exists contingently, then it is possible that at some time, there was nothing in existence. 

P3. If at some time, nothing was in existence, nothing could begin to exist. 

C2. Since things do exist, there was never nothing in existence. 

C3. Therefore, there is something that does not exist contingently, but must exist. 

P4. This necessary being is God. 

C4. God exists.

</br>

### Liebniz’s argument from contingency

P1. The principle of sufficient reason: every true fact has an explanation that provides a sufficient reason for why things are as they are and not otherwise (even if in most cases we can’t know what the reason is). 

P2. There are two kinds of truth: those of reasoning and those of fact. 

P3. Truths of reasoning (e.g. mathematical truths) are necessary, and their opposite is impossible. When a truth is necessary, the reason for it can be found by analysis. We understand the reason for it by understanding why it is necessary. 

P4. Truths of fact (e.g. truths about physical objects) are contingent, and their opposite is possible. For contingent truths, reasons can be given in more and more detail, because of the immense variety of things in Nature. But all this detail only brings in other contingent facts. For example, if we want to explain why I am as tall as I am, we have to refer to many factors, such as genes and upbringing, but each of these truths is itself contingent. 

C1. Each of these further contingent facts also needs to be explained. For example, why do I have the genes I do, why did I have the upbringing I did? 

C2. Therefore, when we give explanations of this sort we move no nearer to the goal of completely explaining contingencies. The sequence of contingent facts doesn’t contain the sufficient reason for any contingent fact. 

C3. Therefore, to provide a sufficient reason for any contingent fact, we must look outside the sequence of contingent facts. 

C4. Therefore, the sufficient reason for contingent facts must be in a necessary substance. 

P6. This necessary substance is God. 

P7. This necessary substance is a sufficient reason for all this detail, which is interconnected throughout. 

C5. So there is only one God, and this God is sufficient.

</br>

### Objection: The impossibility of a necessary being

P1. Nothing that is distinctly conceivable implies a contradiction. 

P2. Whatever we conceive as existent, we can also conceive as non-existent. 

C1. Therefore, there is no being whose non-existence implies a contradiction.

</br>

## The problem of Evil

### Outline of the problem of Evil

P1. If God is supremely good, then he has the desire to eliminate evil. 

P2. If God is omnipotent, then he is able to eliminate evil. 

P3. If God is omniscient, then he knows that evil exists and knows how to eliminate it. 

C1. Therefore, if God exists, and is supremely good, omnipotent and omniscient, then God will eliminate evil. 

C2. Therefore, if a supremely good, omnipotent and omniscient God exists, evil does not exist. 

P4. Evil exists. 

C3. Therefore, a supremely good, omnipotent and omniscient God does not exist.

</br>

### Argument against the free will theodicy

P1. Determinism is true. 

C1. Therefore, our choices have causes. (For instance, those causes might be part of human nature, part of the external environment, our upbringing or social situation, or even previous states of the brain.) 

C2. Therefore, each choice we make has a particular set of causes and takes place in a particular situation. 

C3. Therefore, given those causes and situation, no choice is possible other than what we actually choose. 

P4. If we couldn’t make any other choice, then we do not have free will. 

C4. Therefore, we don’t have free will.

</br>

### Plantinga’s defence of free will

P1. A world containing creatures that are significantly free is better
than a world containing no free creatures.

P2. God can create significantly free creatures.

P3. To be significantly free is to be capable of both moral good and
moral evil.

P4. If significantly free creatures were caused to do only what is
right, they would not be free.

C1. Therefore, God cannot cause significantly free creatures to do
only what is right.

(C2. Therefore, God cannot create a world containing creatures that
are significantly free but which contains no evil.)

C3. Therefore, God can only eliminate the moral evil done by
significantly free creatures by eliminating the greater good of
significantly free creatures.

</br>

## Religious Language

### Verificationism

P1. The verification principle: all meaningful claims are either analytic or empirically verifiable. 

P2. ‘God exists’ is not analytic. 

P3. ‘God exists’ is not empirically verifiable. 

C1. Therefore, ‘God exists’ is not meaningful.

</br>

### The University Debate (Flew)

P1 For a truth claim to be meaningful, there must be some possible state of affairs it denies or rules out. 

C1. To meaningfully assert a claim, someone must accept that it rules out some possible state of affairs. 

P2. The occurrence of a state of affairs that a claim rules out demonstrates that the claim is false. 

C2. To meaningfully assert a claim, someone must be willing to withdraw it if the state of affairs it rules out were to occur. 

P3. Religious believers refuse to specify which state of affairs would lead them to withdraw the claim that ‘God exists’. 

C3. When religious believers say ‘God exists’, they do not rule out any state of affairs. 

C4. The claim that ‘God exists’, when made by religious believers, is meaningless.

</br>

## Substance Dualism

### Descartes’ conceivability argument

P1. I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as something that thinks and isn’t extended.

P2. I have a clear and distinct idea of body as something that is extended and does not think. 

P3. If I have a clear and distinct thought of something, God can create it in a way that corresponds to my thought. 

C1. Therefore, God can create mind as something that thinks and isn’t extended and body as something that is extended and does not think. 

C2. Therefore, mind and body can exist independently of one another. 

C3. Therefore, mind and body are two distinct substances.

</br>

### Descartes’ conceivability argument (simpler)

P1. It is conceivable that mind can exist without body.

C1. Therefore, it is possible that mind can exist without body.

C2. Therefore, mind and body are distinct substances.

</br>

### Conceptual Interaction Problem#

P1. Physical things only move if they are pushed.

P2. Only something that is extended and can touch the thing that is moved can exert such a force.

P3. But the mind has no extension, so it can’t touch the body.

C1. Therefore, the mind cannot move the body.

</br>

P1. The movement of a physical object is only initiated by some physical force, exerted at some point in space. 

P2. If dualism is true, then the mind is not in space and cannot exert any physical force. 

C1. Therefore, if dualism is true, the mind cannot cause any physical object to move. 

C2. Therefore, either dualism is false or the mind cannot cause (any part of) the body to move.

P3. The mind can cause the body to move. 

C3. Therefore, dualism is false.

</br>

### Problem of other minds: argument from analogy

P1. I have a mind. 

P2. I know from experience that my mental states cause my behaviour. 

P3. Other people have bodies similar to mine and behave similarly to me in similar situations. 

C1. Therefore, by analogy, their behaviour has the same type of cause as my behaviour, namely mental states. 

C2. Therefore, other people have minds.

</br>

## MBTIT

### Conceivability argument

P1. It is conceivable that, for any type of mental state, someone has a particular type of mental state without having the brain state with which, the identity theory claims, it is identical. 

P2. What is conceivable is metaphysically possible. 

C1. Therefore, it is metaphysically possible that for any type of mental state, it can exist in the absence of the brain state with which the identity theory claims it is identical. 

P3. If one thing can exist in the absence of a second thing, they are not the same thing. 

C2. Therefore, mental states cannot be brain states.

</br>

## Behaviourism

### Multiple Realisability of mental states

P1. People with the same mental state behave differently, both in different circumstances and even in the same circumstance. 

P2. It is not possible to draw up a finite list of hypothetical conditionals or statements of the conditions of verification that describe all the ways someone with that mental state may behave. 

C1. Therefore, the claim that mental states can be analysed in terms of behaviour is false. 

C2. Therefore, philosophical behaviourism is false.

</br>

P1. People with the same mental state behave differently, both in different circumstances and even in the same circumstance. 

C1. Therefore, what makes it true that two people have the same mental state is not that they have the same behavioural dispositions. 

C2. Therefore, philosophical behaviourism is false.

</br>

### Asymmetry between self-knowledge and knowledge of others

P1. The analysis of mental states in terms of behavioural dispositions (or conditions of verification) rules out an asymmetry between selfknowledge and knowledge of other people’s mental states. 

P2. Yet it seems obvious from experience that there is such an asymmetry. 

C1. Therefore, philosophical behaviourism is false.

</br>

## Functionalism

### Phenomenal Properties and Functional States

P1. Qualia, by definition, are intrinsic, non-Intentional properties of conscious mental states. 

P2. Intrinsic, non-Intentional properties cannot, by definition, be completely analysed in terms of their causal roles (or as machine-table states). 

C1. Therefore, if qualia exist, some mental properties cannot be analysed in terms of their causal roles (or as machine-table states). 

P3. Functionalism claims that all mental properties are functional properties which can be completely analysed in terms of their causal roles (or as machine-table states). 

C2. Therefore, if qualia exist, functionalism is false. 

P4. Qualia exist. 

C3. Therefore, functionalism is false.

</br>

## Property Dualism

### Mary/Knowledge argument

P1. Mary knows all the physical facts about seeing colours before being released from her black-and-white room. 

P2. On being released, she learns new facts about seeing colours. 

C1. Therefore, not all facts are physical facts, e.g. some facts about colours are not. 

C2. Therefore, phenomenal properties are non-physical and physicalism is false.

</br>

### Mary does not gain propositional knowledge, but does gain acquaintance knowledge

P1. Mary (before her release) knows everything physical there is to know about other people when they see colour.

P2. Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to know about other people when they see colour (because she learns something about them on her release).

C1. Therefore, there are truths about other people (and herself) when they see colour which escape the physicalist story.


C2. Therefore, phenomenal properties are non-physical and physicalism is false.

</br>

### Philosophical Zombies: Conceivability

P1. It is conceivable that there are zombies. 

P2. If it is conceivable that there are zombies, it is metaphysically possible that there are zombies. 

C1. Therefore, it is metaphysically possible that there are zombies. 

P3. If it is metaphysically possible that there are zombies, then phenomenal properties of consciousness are neither physical properties nor supervene on physical properties. 

C2. Therefore, phenomenal properties of consciousness are neither physical properties nor supervene on physical properties. 

C3. Therefore, physicalism is false and property dualism is true.

</br>

### Philosophical Zombies are not conceivable

P1. A zombie is a physical duplicate of a person with phenomenal consciousness, but without phenomenal consciousness. 

P2. (If physicalism is true,) A physical duplicate is a functional duplicate. 

C1. Therefore, a zombie is a physical and functional duplicate of a person, but without phenomenal consciousness.

P3. (If physicalism is true,) Phenomenal properties are physical properties realising particular functional roles. 

C2. Therefore, a physical and functional duplicate of a person with phenomenal consciousness has phenomenal consciousness. 

P4. A physical and functional duplicate of a person with consciousness cannot both have and lack phenomenal consciousness. 

C3. Therefore, (if physicalism is true,) zombies are inconceivable.

</br>

## The Tripartite View

### Infallibalism

P1. No one can know what is false.

C1. Therefore, if I know that p, then I can't be mistaken about p.

C2. Therefore, for justification to secure knowledge, justification must guarantee truth.

C3. Therefore, if I am justified in believing that p, I can't possibly be mistaken.

C4. Therefore, if it is possible that I am mistaken, then I can't be justified in believing that p.

C5. Therefore, infallibilism is true.

</br>

## Direct Realism

### Perceptual Variation

P1. There are variations in perception. 

P2. Our perception varies without corresponding changes in the physical object we perceive. (For instance, the table remains rectangular, even as the way it looks to me changes as I look at it from different angles.) 

C1. Therefore, the properties physical objects have and the properties they appear to have are not identical. 

C2. Therefore, what we are immediately aware of in perception is not exactly the same as what exists independently of our minds. 

C3. Therefore, we do not perceive physical objects directly.

</br>

### Argument from illusion

P1. We perceive something having some property F (e.g. a pencil that is crooked).

P2. When we perceive something as having some property F, then there is something that is F. (Something we see is F.)

P3. In an illusion, the physical object does not have the property F (the pencil is not crooked).

C1. Therefore, in illusions, what has the property F is something mental, a sense-datum.

C2. Therefore, in illusions, we see sense-data, and not physical objects, immediately.

P4. Illusions can be ‘subjectively indistinguishable’ from veridical
perception.

C3. Therefore, we see the same thing, namely sense-data, in both illusions and veridical perception.

C4. Therefore, in all cases, we see sense-data, and not physical objects, immediately.

C5. Therefore, direct realism is false.

</br>

### Argument from hallucination

P1. In a hallucination, we perceive something having some property F. 

P2. When we perceive something as having some property F, then there is something that is F. 

P3. In a hallucination, we don't perceive a physical object at all. 

C1. Therefore, what we perceive must be mental . sense-data. 

P4. Hallucinations can be experiences that are ‘subjectively indistinguishable’ from veridical perceptions. 

C2. Therefore, we see the same thing, namely sense-data, in both hallucinations and veridical perception. 

C3. Therefore, in all cases, we see sense-data, and not physical objects, immediately. 

C4. Therefore, direct realism is false.

</br>

## Indirect Realism
### Argument for indirect realism

P1. There are many perceptual experiences in which what we experience are not the properties of physical objects. 

P2. When we perceive something as having some property F, then there is something that is F. 

C1. In such cases, given that what we perceive is not the way the world is, what we perceive are sense-data. 

P3. Such cases are subjectively indistinguishable from veridical perception. 

P4. When two perceptual experiences are subjectively indistinguishable, they are perceptual experiences of the same thing. (This claim is the best hypothesis, given P3.)

C2. Therefore, we always perceive sense-data (not just in cases in which what we perceive is not the way the world is). 

P5. Nevertheless, except in hallucinations, it still makes sense to say we perceive the world. In cases of both veridical perception and illusion, the sense-data we perceive are caused by and represent physical objects. This representation can be accurate or inaccurate in certain ways . physical objects may be as they appear to us, or they may differ in certain ways. 

C3. Therefore, we perceive physical objects indirectly, via sense-data.

</br>

### The existence of the external world is the best hypothesis

P1. The fact that sense-data are private means that no two people actually ever perceive the same thing, unless we can say that there are physical objects that they both perceive (indirectly). 

P2. People have very similar sense-data if they are at the same place and time. 

P3. The best explanation of this is that there are physical objects causing their sense-data: they both perceive the same physical object. 

C1. So physical objects exist.

</br>

P1. Either physical objects exist and cause my sense-data or physical objects do not exist and do not cause my sense-data. 

P2. I can't prove either claim is true or false. 

C1. Therefore, I have to treat them as hypotheses. (A hypothesis is a proposal that needs to be confirmed or rejected by reasoning or experience.) 

P3. The hypothesis that physical objects exist and cause my sense-data is better. (This is essentially P5 in the general argument for indirect realism)

C2. Therefore, physical objects exist and cause my sense-data.

</br>

## Idealism
### Berkely on secondary qualities

P1. A cloud from a distance looks pink, but up close, it loses its colour (or appears grey). 

P2. A solid physical object, viewed through a microscope, appears to have different colours than those it has when viewed normally. 

P3. Different animals perceive the colours of objects differently. 

P4. If colours really existed in physical objects, then to change the colour, it would be necessary to change the object itself. But, of course, different kinds of light . daylight, candlelight, etc. . change the colour of an object without changing the object. 

C1. Therefore, all colours are appearances, not properties of physical objects.

</br>

### Berkely’s attack on the primary/secondary quality distinction

P1. What looks small to me may look huge to a small animal.

P2. What looks small from a distance looks large when viewed close up. 

P3. What looks smooth to the naked eye appears craggy and uneven under a microscope. 

P4. If you look at a circle straight on, it looks circular. But if I'm looking at it from an angle, it looks elliptical. We see it differently, but it doesn't change. 

P5. Even motion isn't constant. We measure the speed of motion by how quickly our minds work . to a creature that responds much faster than us, e.g. a housefly, our fastest movements appear leisurely. 

P6. In the case of colour, when an object appears to have many colours, depending on how it is perceived, we can't say that it has one real colour which is independent of how we perceive it. 

C1. Therefore, P1-P5 show that we can't say that an object has one real shape or size or motion, independent of how it is perceived. 

C2. Therefore, the primary qualities of objects are just as mind-dependent as secondary qualities.

</br>

### The immediate objects of perception are mind-dependent objects

P1. Everything we perceive is either a primary or a secondary quality. 

P2. Both primary and secondary qualities are mind-dependent. 

C1. Therefore, nothing that we perceive exists independently of the mind: the objects of perception are entirely mind-dependent.

</br>

### An argument against mind-dependent physical objects: we perceive physical objects

P1. As argued previously, all we perceive are primary and secondary qualities, not mind-independent physical objects. 

C1. Therefore, our experience cannot verify the hypothesis that there is a mind-independent physical world. 

P2. Worse still, the hypothesis of ‘physical substance’ is not one that is even suggested by experience. 

C2. So close að|ention to experience supports the claim that all there is (all we can say there is) is what we can experience. 

P3. What we experience are ideas. 

C3. Therefore, our experience supports idealism, not realism.

</br>

### Berkely’s Master Argument - confusion

P1. Thoughts cannot exist outside the mind . thoughts are psychological events or states. 

C1. Therefore, my thinking of a tree is not mind-independent. It is impossible (inconceivable) that there is a thought of a tree when no one is thinking of a tree. 

P2. But what a thought is about, e.g. a tree, is not the same thing as the thought itself. 

C2. Therefore, just because my thinking of a tree is mind-dependent, it does not follow that what I am thinking of is also minddependent. It is not impossible (inconceivable) to think that a tree may exist when no one is thinking of it. (Or, at least, the ‘master’ argument doesn't show this. If mind-independent physical objects are inconceivable for some other reason, then this thought is impossible.)

</br>

### Idealism and God

P1. As (the ideas that comprise) physical objects are mind-dependent, there are three possible causes of my perceptions: ideas, my mind, and another mind.

P2. Ideas (including the ideas that comprise physical objects) don't cause anything. 

P3. If (the ideas that comprise) physical objects depended on my mind, then I would be able to control what I perceive. 

P4. But I can't. Perception is quite different to imagining; in perception, we are more passive. the sensations just occur to us, and we can't control them. Imagination is voluntary, but perception is involuntary. 

C1. Therefore, (the ideas that comprise) physical objects don't depend on my mind. 

C2. Therefore, (the ideas that comprise) physical objects must exist in another mind, which then wills that I perceive them. 

C3. Given the complexity and systematicity of our perceptions, that mind must be God.

</br>

### Idealism and the cause of our perceptions

P1. Mað|er in the normal sense of the word, i.e. as mindindependent and possessing primary qualities, cannot exist (as argued previously). 

C1. Therefore, to talk any sense about mað|er, we must think of it as our perceptions of it. 

P2. What we perceive. primary and secondary qualities. are ideas. 

C2. Given that ideas are passive, whatever causes our perceptions must be a mind, not matter.

</br>


### Ideas cannot be part of God’s mind

P1. My perceptions and sensations are part of my mind. What I perceive and feel is in my mind, not God's mind. 

P2. God can't have the sorts of perceptual experiences I have . God doesn't perceive as I do, and does not undergo sensations, such as pain. P3. The ordinary objects of my perception change and go out of existence, but God's mind is said to be unchanging and eternal. 

C1. Therefore, what I perceive and feel can't be part of God's mind.

</br>

### Idealism leads to solipsism

P1. The mind is that which (actively) perceives, thinks and wills, while ideas are passive.

P2. I am aware of myself as capable of this activity. C1. Therefore, I am not my ideas, but a mind. 

P3. Being a mind myself, I have a ‘notion’ of what a mind is. 

C2. Therefore, it is possible that other minds exist. 

P4. My perceptions don't originate in my mind. 

C3. Therefore, they are caused by some other mind. 

C4. The complexity, regularity, etc., of my experience indicates that this mind is God.

## Innatism

### Locke’s argument against innate knowledge: children and idiots

P1. If there is innate knowledge, it is universal. 

P2. For an idea to be part of the mind, the mind (the person) must know or be conscious of it: ‘it seems to me nearly a contradiction to say that there are truths imprinted on the soul that it doesn't perceive or understand. No proposition can be said to be in the mind which it has never known or been conscious of’. 

C1. Therefore, innate knowledge is knowledge that every human being is or has been conscious of. 

P3. Children and ‘idiots’ do not know theorems in geometry or ‘It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be’. (They do not know these claims, because they do not understand them.)

C2. Therefore, these claims are not innate. 

P4. There are no claims that are universally accepted, including by children and ‘idiots’. 

C3. Therefore, there is no innate knowledge.

## Rational Intuition

### Clear and distinct ideas

P1. ‘In this first item of knowledge there is simply a clear and distinct perception of what I am asserting.’ 

P2. If clarity and distinctness do not guarantee truth, then I cannot know that I exist. 

P3. I do know that I exist. 

C1. Therefore, ‘as a general rule whatever I perceive very clearly and distinctly is true’.

</br>

### Clear and Distinct Ideas and God

P1. God exists. 

P2. By definition, God is supremely perfect. 

P3. 'The natural light makes it clear that all fraud and deception depend on some defect'. 

P4. (By definition, something that is supremely perfect can have no defects.) 

C1. Therefore, it is not possible for God to deceive us.

</br>

### God’s existence against the evil demon argument

P1. God is supremely powerful. 

P2. If God is supremely powerful, then an evil demon could only deceive me if God allowed it. 

P3. If an evil demon is deceiving me, then I have no way of correcting my false opinions. 

P4. If I have no way of correcting my false opinions, then God is a deceiver. 

C1. Therefore, if God permits an evil demon to deceive me, then God is a deceiver. 

P5. God is not a deceiver. 

C2. Therefore, God will not permit an evil demon to deceive me.

</br>

### Descartes’ Trademark Argument

P1. I have the concept GOD.

P2. The concept GOD is a concept of something infinite and perfect. 

P3. As a mind, a thinking substance, I can think up (create) many ideas, including ideas of people and physical objects. 

P4. But I am finite, while the concept GOD is a concept of something infinite.

C1. Therefore, it is a concept of something with more reality than my own mind. 

P5. The cause of the concept GOD must have as much reality as what the concept is of.

C2. Therefore, my mind could not have created it. 

P6. The only possible cause is God. 

C3. Therefore, God exists.

</br>

### Descartes’ Ontological Argument


P1. I have the idea of God. 

P2. The idea of God is the idea of a supremely perfect being. 

P3. A supremely perfect being does not laðz any perfection. 

P4. Existence is a perfection. 

C1. Therefore, God exists.

</br>

### Empiricist response to Descartes’ Ontological Argument

P1. Nothing that is distinctly conceivable implies a contradiction. 

P2. Whatever we conceive as existent, we can also conceive as nonexistent. 

C1. Therefore, there is no being whose non-existence implies a contradiction.

</br>

### Descartes’ concept of a physical object

P1. When I melt a piece of wax, it loses all of its original sensory qualities (the particular taste, smell, feel and shape it has). 

P2. Yet I believe it is the same wax. 

C1. Therefore, what I think of as the wax is not its sensory qualities. 

P3. What I think is the wax is what remains through the changes of its sensory qualities. 

P4. This is a body, something that is extended . i.e. has size and shape and takes up space . and changeable, i.e. its sensory and spatial properties can change. 

P5. I know that the wax can undergo far more possible changes, including changes in its extension, than I can imagine. 

C2. Therefore, my concept of the wax as extended and changeable does not derive from my imagination (and therefore it does not derive from perceptual experiences). 

C3. Therefore, I comprehend the wax as what it is (as opposed to its sensory qualities) by my mind alone. 

C4. Only this thought of the wax, and not the perceptual experience of it, is clear and distinct.

</br>

### The existence of physical objects

P1. I have a clear and distinct idea of what a physical object is. 

P2. (God exists and is supremely powerful.) 

P3. The only reason for thinking that God cannot make something is that the concept of it is contradictory. 

C1. Therefore, God can make physical objects. 

C2. Therefore, (if God exists) it is possible that physical objects exist.

</br>

P1. The imagination uses images, e.g. imagining a triangle. But the understanding does not. We cannot imagine a chiliagon, a two-dimensional figure with 1,000 sides. But we can work mathematically with it, e.g. working out its internal angles. 

P2. Imagining takes more effort than understanding. 

C1. Therefore, imagination and understanding are different. 

P3. Imagination is not essential to me, while understanding is. I cannot be me (a thinking thing) without understanding, but I can be me without imagination. 

P4. The best explanation for all these differences is that imagination depends upon having a body. (Imagination draws its ideas from the body, which makes its ideas sensory images and difficult to work with, and makes imagination not essential to a thinking thing. Being purely mental, understanding draws its ideas from itself, making them non-imagistic and easy to work with, and understanding is essential to a thinking thing.) 

C2. Therefore, it is probable that the body (a physical object) exists.
