Issues for Act Utilitarianism - Partiality ^OKnbEQOD

Act Utilitarianism argues that in our decisions, we need to consider the greatest happiness that our actions
could create, and this requires us to treat each person's happiness equally, i.e. be impartial. If Act Utilitarianism
is correct, then it seems to entirely ignore partiality - we should spend less time with the people we love and
instead spend that time helping people who need our aid. Likewise, we should spend less money on those we love
and give more to charity. This would lead to greater happiness, but is impartiality always required of us?

This conflict can be developed in various different ways. For instance, we can argue that Utilitarianism is too
idealistic, or argue that it misses something morally important in treating everyone equally. In abstract, every
person is equal, but to me, some should count more than others. It is not morally wrong to show partiality towards
those who one knows and loves. ^rDoWVkrS

One response that Mill gives is that there are very few opportunities that any of us have to benefit people 'in
general', and so only considering and contributing to the happiness of a few people is morally permissible. Partiality
is required in principle, but in reality we serve the greatest happiness by showing partiality. ^eKnrAcKC
