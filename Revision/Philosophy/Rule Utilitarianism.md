Rule Utilitarianism ^ft1EkG56




Rule Utilitarianism claims that an action is right if, and only if, it complies with those rules which, if everybody
followed them, would lead to the greatest happiness. An action is morally right if it complies with a rule that
is morally right. ^XFhWXVED

Smart's initial objection ^x9j7OKRl

Smart objects that Rule Utilitarianism amounts to 'Rule Worship'. If there is a situation in which breaking a 
rule will lead to more happiness than following it, then what reason could we have for following the rule.
The best course of action is for some people to break the rule sometimes, when it leads to the greatest
happiness to do so.

The Rule Utilitarian response to this is that we should amend the rule to allow the exception in such cases.
However, Smart points out that if we keep amending rules like this, there is no difference between Act and Rule
Utilitarianism. Furthermore, all amendments to rules lead back to the utility principle, to maximise the greatest
happiness. Rule Utilitarianism collapses into Act Utilitarianism. ^FCR670Zb

The Rule Utilitarianism argues that morality should be understood as a set of rules. It needs to provide general
guidance over the long term, something that people can rely on and remember. We need to take in the bigger picture.
Since we are to have rules, then the aim of these should be to maximise happiness. Even if an action fails to
maximise happiness in a particular situation, it is still right if it follows a happiness-maximising rule. ^dun1sGwO
