Time-Lag Argument ^szpK6VMq

There is an argument to be made that we do not see things directly, as there is a time-lag between a
physical object and our perception of it. We see the sun indirectly, through light waves. Therefore, we can
argue that what we perceive is the physical medium by which we detect physical object. So, we don't
perceive physical objects directly. ^GtekXCye

The Direct Realist can respond that this is a confusion between how we perceive and what we perceive.
If we compare two pairs of questions:

1) 'Can you see the lake?' and 'Can you see the light reflecting off the lake?'
2) 'Can you see the paper' and 'Can you see the light reflecting from the paper?'

In (1), we can turn our attention from the lake to the light reflecting off it - we can talk literally
about seeing the light. But in (2) there is no difference in what one is supposed to see. To see the light
that the paper reflects is the same as seeing the paper. Direct Realism can therefore argue that
we don't perceive light waves directly and physical objects indirectly. ^ZWpyPzpz
