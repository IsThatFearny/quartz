# Empiricist Responses to Scepticism

</br>

### Locke

Locke presents two arguments: 

1) The coherence of my sense suggests that there is a mind-independent reality causing my perception, e.g. when i See a fire, I also feel the heat and smell the smoke. The fact that the same object is being experienced by different senses suggests a common reality.
2) Perception is involuntary - I cannot choose what I perceive. I can imagine whatever I like, e.g. a sunny afternoon, but when I open my eyes, I cannot avoid or change what I perceive, e.g. rain. Therefore there must be a mind-independent reality which I experience.

### Russell

Russell argues that the existence of the external world is the most plausible theory in correspondence with our experience and perception. He gives the example of a cat:



</br>

### Berkeley

Berkeley claims that we have immediate experience of the external world, but that this world is mind-dependent, rather than mind-independent.

The sceptic argues that we cannot be certain that our perceptions accurately reflect the external world, but Berkeley shows that what we perceive *just is* what exists; the content of perception is ideas, which we perceive immediately. Berkeley rejects the distinction between appearance and reality (which scepticism relies on).

### Reliabilism

Perception is a reliable cognitive process which produces a hgih percentage of true beliefs.

Scepticism is too restrictive and narrow; we can generally rely on and trust our senses to tell us the truth about the external world. Therefore, I should trust my sense and put scepticism to one side.
