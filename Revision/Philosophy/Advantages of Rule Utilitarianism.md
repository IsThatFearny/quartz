Advantages of Rule Utilitarianism ^zLALjqhq

1) Problems with calculation: We don't have to calculate the consequences of each action to see if it is
right. We only need work out rules once, and we can do it together (i.e. Mill's secondary principles). Rule
Utilitarianism gives rules a formal place in its theory.

2) Fairness, Individual Liberty, and Rights: A rule forbidding the torture of children will clearly cause more
happiness if everyone followed it than a rule allowing it. Therefore it is wrong to torture children. More
generally, individuals have rights, which are rules, because if people have to follow these rules (i.e. respect
people's rights) then this will lead to the greatest happiness. Rules requiring fairness and justice will
produce greater happiness in the long run that rules that do not, and this will prevent the tyranny of the
majority

3) Partiality: A rule that allows partiality to ourselves, our family and friends will create more happiness
than a rule that requires us to be impartial all the time. Partial relationships are of moral importance
because they are necessary to happiness. Of course, we shouldn't be completely partial. We still need to
consider the general happiness, but we only need act in a way that, if everyone acted as such, would promote
the greatest happiness. ^9Ok5WlSp


4) Moral integrity: The best rule, perhaps, will be one that allows exceptions to other rules, i.e. a rule that
allows people not to follow other rules if they conflict with one's integrity.

5) Intentions: A rule prohibiting murder is not a rule prohibiting self-defence, because the intentions are
different. Whether an action complies with a rule or not depends in part on the individual's intention in
performing the act. Two actions may have the same consequences, and yet one is right and one is wrong,
because they are different types of action and so fall under different moral rules. ^VzGSB2o1
