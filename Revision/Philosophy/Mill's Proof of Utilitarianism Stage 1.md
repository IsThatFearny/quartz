Mill's Proof of Utilitarianism: Stage 1 ^z92xyaqO

1) The sole evidence that something is desirable
is that people desire it

2) No reason can be given why the general happiness
is desirable except that each person desires his own
happiness

3) Each person takes their own happiness to be good,
and so adding each person's happiness to the happiness
of others, the happiness of everyone is good for people
in general  ^Uqf8GboE

Fallacy of Equivocation ^fioELngF

Moore objects that Mill commits the fallacy of equivocation,
i.e. he confuses two meanings of a word. The word 'desirable'
can have two meanings, Moore argues: either 'worthy of being
desired' or 'capable of being desired'. If the former is Mill's
intended definition, then his proof is sound, but if it is the
latter, then it does not hold, as people desire all sorts of
things that do not maximise happiness in any way.

Moore, however, misinterprets Mill's argument. Mill is arguing
that people in general desire happiness. Unless people in general
desire what is not worth desiring, then we have good evidence
that happiness is desirable. There is nothing that everyone wants
that is not worth wanting.

 ^7mEJsN7M

Fallacy of Composition ^3F7daJHf

However, this again misunderstands Mill's argument. At no point does Mill
defend the idea of impartiality in ethics. He assumes that ethics, by its
very nature, is concerned with what is good in general. He is not attempting
to infer that we ought to be concerned for the happiness of others. It 
therefore follows from his assumption that ethics is impartial that we
should be concerned with the general happiness. ^iDDtooKw

Some philosophers argue that Mill commits the fallacy of composition, 
i.e. the inference that because some part has a property, the whole 
of which it is a part has said property. Mill seems to argue that, 
because each person desires their own happiness, everyone desires 
everyone's happiness. But this doesn't follow. For example, suppose 
that every girl loves a sailor. From the fact that for each girl, there
is some sailor whom she loves, we cannot infer that there is one sailor
which every girl loves. Substitute the former instance of 'sailor' with 
'own happiness', and the latter with 'general happiness', and we see
that there is a fallacy committed here  ^KG3DbgVp
