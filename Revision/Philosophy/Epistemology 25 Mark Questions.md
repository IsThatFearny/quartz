## Tripartite View

### How should propositional knowledge be defined?

Propositional knowledge has many proposed definitions. In this essay, I shall test various definitions such as Justified True Belief, No False Lemmas, and Sosa’s Virtue Epistemology against multiple counter-examples, and will argue that Sosa’s virtue epistemology provides the correct definition of propositional knowledge.

Propositional knowledge is knowledge that can be expressed by a declarative statement (‘knowledge-that’). It has truth value (i.e. a proposition is either true or false), and can be a priori and a posteriori, analytic and synthetic. It exists as opposed to ability knowledge (‘knowledge-how’), which is our knowledge of how to do something such as ride a bike. Ability knowledge is subconscious and difficult to explain; and acquaintance knowledge, which is our knowledge of a place or person, such as my knowledge of Oxford or of my best friend.

Previously, the commonly accepted definition of knowledge was Justified True Belief (henceforth, JTB). This definition claimed that S knows that P if and only if: P is true; S believes that P; and S’ belief that P is justified. This would, at first glance, seem to be a sound definition. However, in the mid-20th century, Edmund Gettier proposed two counter-examples that seemed to disprove JTB as a theory of knowledge. The first runs as follows: Smith and Jones are both applying for a job; Smith overhears the boss saying that Jones will get the job; at the same time, he sees Jones counting out 10 coins from his pocket; he thus forms the belief that ‘the man with 10 coins in his pocket will get the job’; however, Smith gets the job, and to his surprise, he also has 10 coins in his pocket. So, it would seem that his belief is true (the man with 10 coins in his pocket did indeed get the job), he believes it, and it is justified (the boss would know who was going to get the job, so the information was reliable). This creates a scenario where Smith has knowledge by pure coincidence under JTB, and Gettier objects that this cannot be correct. 

In an attempt to overcome this counter-example, a second definition can be offered, namely that of ‘No False Lemmas’. This theory claims that S knows that P if and only if: P is true; S believes that P; and S’ belief that P does not arise from a false lemma (i.e. a false claim part way through a thought process). In the case of Smith and Jones, it would seem that No False Lemmas prevents Smith from having knowledge through luck, because the boss’ claim is a false lemma, and his belief arises from this, and therefore is discounted as not being knowledge, despite being true and believed. However, a second counter-example can be proposed which challenges this definition. Zagzebski introduces her example of ‘Dr Jones and the Virus’, which runs as follows: Dr Jones is treating Smith, her patient. He is presenting with symptoms of Virus X, and his bloodwork and lab results indicate the same. So, Jones concludes that he has Virus X. However, these symptoms and results have actually arisen from Virus Y, which is, by all appearances, almost identical. But, by coincidence, after these tests have been done, Smith is infected with Virus X. Therefore, when Dr Jones forms her belief that ‘Smith has Virus X’, it is a true belief, and it has not arisen from a false lemma, as all the evidence was correct. This counter-example is successful, and it cannot therefore be argued that JTB + No False Lemmas is the correct definition of knowledge.

Neither of the preceding definitions have been able to overcome coincidental knowledge in the counter-examples presented. Zagzebski argues that this is because there is a ‘truth-gap’ between truth and any third condition that attempts to strengthen justification, and whilst this truth-gap is present, counter-examples can be created to disprove theories.

Sosa’s account of Virtue Epistemology overcomes this. To understand this, we must first define an intellectual virtue. Zagzebski’s definition is that an intellectual virtue (in a similar way to Aristotle’s account of virtue) is one that is motivated to find the truth, and succeeds in this endeavour. Sosa claims that S knows that P if and only if: P is Accurate (the belief is true); S’ belief that P is Adroit (S is intellectually virtuous); and P is true as a result of an act of intellectual virtue - it is Apt. This is known as Sosa’s ‘Triple A’ Virtue Epistemology. In defining knowledge as such, Sosa is able to overcome counter-examples such as those above because the knowledge in these is not *apt*. Aptness bridges the truth-gap between truth and the third condition by directly linking the two, and so coincidental knowledge is not possible. In the case of Smith and Jones, Smith’s belief that ‘the man with 10 coins in his pocket will get the job’ is not apt, because its truth does not arise from an act of intellectual virtue - it is merely a coincidental connection. Similarly, in the case of Dr Jones and the virus, Dr Jones’ belief that Smith has Virus X is not counted as knowledge, because it is again, not apt - there is no link between the truth of her belief and the use of intellectual virtue. 

Sosa’s definition bridges the gap between truth and the third condition, and as a result is able to overcome counter-examples modelled on this truth-gap. Other definitions such as JTB and No False Lemmas cannot do this, and so it can clearly be shown that Sosa’s Virtue Epistemology is the strongest definition of knowledge.

## Direct Realism

### Assess Direct Realism

Direct Realism is the claim that we perceive the mind-independent external world exactly as it is. However, it is a highly contentious view, and can be objected to in various ways. Thus, in this essay, it shall be argued that Direct Realism is false.

Mind-independent objects are those which are not dependent upon our perception for their existence - rather, they rely on some other cause. Direct Realism claims that we perceive these directly, without any alteration in their objective appearance.

One issue that can be raised with Direct Realism is the argument from time-lag. We may object that we do not perceive the mind-independent external world directly, because what we perceive has a time-lag. For example, the sun at the present moment looks different to our perception of it because it is 8 light-minutes away, and so we see the sun as it was 8 minutes ago. If we perceived directly, then it would seem that we would have to perceive the sun as it is at the present moment. Even when perceiving objects that are closer, there is a time lag between the reflection of light waves from objects and our perception of said light waves. Therefore, it can be argued that due to the time-lag of our perception, we do not perceive mind-independent physical objects directly, and thus direct realism is false. However, the Direct Realist can respond to the argument from time-lag. They can argue that the argument confuses what we perceive and how we perceive it. For example, we perceive the sun, but we perceive it via light waves. Direct Realism can still claim that we perceive the sun directly, but just as it was minutes ago. We still directly perceive the light waves that it emits, and the workings of physics do not apply to our perception in this way. Whilst Direct Realism is weakened by this objection, the Direct Realist response is strong enough to overcome this objection.

We can also object to Direct Realism by arguing from illusion. Take, for example, a pencil that is in water. As it enters the waterline, there seems to be a kink in the pencil, making it look crooked. It is, of course, not crooked, and its appearance is just a result of refraction. However, Direct Realism would have to claim that the pencil is in fact crooked, because it argues that we perceive mind-independent physical objects exactly as they appear. Therefore, if the pencil *appears* crooked, then it *is* crooked. This seems absurd, and so we can argue that Direct Realism cannot hold. The Direct Realist can respond by appealing to relational properties. A relational property is a property that relates to something else. For example, ‘being to the north of’ is a relational property. The Direct Realist would argue that the pencil in water has the relational property of ‘looking crooked in water’ (the property is related to water and is therefore relational), but is not crooked in reality. This allows Direct Realism to maintain the claim that we perceive mind-independent physical objects directly, because our perception of the pencil as crooked is a result of relational properties - it simply appears crooked in certain circumstances.

However, another issue with Direct Realism can be raised, which raises serious doubts over its plausibility. Similarly to an illusion, a hallucination causes us to perceive something deceiving. However, we cannot respond to hallucination by appealing to relational properties, because the content of our hallucinations are mind-dependent, and do not really exist. Therefore, they cannot have relational properties, because our hallucinations have no bearing in the mind-independent external world. The Direct Realist has no response to this, and so we can argue that Direct Realism fails entirely because it cannot account for our perception of hallucinations. We have no way of distinguishing hallucination from objective reality, and this lack of distinction causes Direct Realism to collapse.

In conclusion, despite sound responses to the objection from time-lag and illusion, Direct Realism’s failure to account for hallucinations and inability to distinguish them from objective reality causes us to conclude that it cannot hold. If we take Direct Realism to be true, then we must accept the possibility of our reality being a deception, a hallucination. This is clearly absurd, and so we must replace Direct Realism with a different theory of perception.
