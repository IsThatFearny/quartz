Issues for Act Utilitarianism - Justice ^gPMOUiqg




Mill discusses the problem of whether Utilitarianism can give a plausible account of justice. He argues that,
at its heart, justice is about the moral rights of the individual. We think of each of the following as a
violation of justice: ^4HGMqAsD

Violating someone's legal rights; violating someone's moral rights (laws are sometimes ^HEMhcOR8

wrong); not giving someone what they deserve; breaking a contract or promise; failing to be impartial when 
required; and treating people unequally. ^TEyGjtOd

Justice is distinctive because it relates to actions that harm a specific individual, who has the right that we
do not harm them in this way. Duties of justice are 'perfect' duties, which we must always fulfil, no matter
when or how. ^4Z4KiYOJ

The question is, why do we have the rights that we have? Mill argues that our interests that are protected
by rights are concerned with security, as we depend on security for protection from harm and for the ability to
enjoy what is good without fearing that it will be taken from us. These contribute most to happiness in the long
term. ^D95J54Dn
