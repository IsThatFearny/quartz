# Malcom's Ontological Argument + One Criticism


Ontological arguments deduce the existence of God from the concept of God; in thinking about what God is, we can conclude that God must exist. Malcolm’s version is as follows: 

- A being whose non-existence is inconceivable is greater than one whose non-existence is conceivable
- Necessary existence is a perfection
- If God exists, he has necessary existence (this is part of the concept of God)
- If God does not exist, it is impossible for him to exist (as his existence would be contingent, rather than necessary)
- Therefore God’s existence is either necessary or impossible
- His existence is only impossible if the nature of God is self-contradictory/incoherent, which it isn’t
- Therefore, God’s existence is necessary

However, we can say that God’s non-existence is not dependent on whether his nature is incoherent. His non-existence is logically impossible, in that we cannot bring about the existence of something which cannot be brought into existence.
