# Text Elements
Utilitarianism can be argued to be attacking our moral integrity, as it seems to require that we set our moral values
aside.

The example of George aids us in understanding here. George is a chemist who is looking for work. He has a wife and children,
and his lack of a job is putting considerable stress on the family. It is suggested to George that he get a job in a lab that
researches chemical weaponry. George is strongly opposed to chemical warfare and so wants to refuse the job. But it is
pointed out to him that if he refuses the job, someone else will take it and do it more effectively.

Utilitarianism argues that George should take the job., because it would maximise the general happiness. However, this conflicts
with his moral values. Utilitarianism takes this into account, and maintains that the happiness would outweigh suffering. This
makes it clear that Utilitarianism does not take into account moral values. 

Mill could respond that integrity is central to happiness, and it doesn't maximise happiness to require people to act against their
integrity. But we can object yet again that Mill is appealing to a rule and so gives up on Act Utilitarianism. ^mhs8MYvq
