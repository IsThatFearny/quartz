Issues for Act Utilitarianism - A discussion on Justice ^QCJKtPBL

Perhaps a clearer objection involving justice is that Mill's theory of rights doesn't offer a strong defence of individual rights in particular
cases. If the ground of rights is the general happiness, then it would seem that the grounds on which our rights are protected are insecure.
Utilitarianism cannot offer any reason to respect our rights in situations such as the Trolley Problem.

Mill might respond that this approach to conflict between rights and happiness in individual case misunderstands Utilitarianism. We need to
consider happiness in the 'largest sense'. Rights protect our permanent interests, and thus serve the general happiness considered over the
long term. We should establish the system of rights that brings about the most happiness, and then defend these rights.

But the objection now must be that Mill has given up on Act Utilitarianism as a whole. He seems to recommend that we disregard the
consequences of our actions, and instead create rights, which are a kind of rule, and enforce them even when they conflict with the utility
principle. It seems, therefore, that Mill must adopt Rule Utilitarianism/ ^nLEIgLPJ
