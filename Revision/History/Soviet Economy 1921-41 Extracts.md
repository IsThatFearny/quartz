# Soviet Economy 1921-41 Extracts

> **Extract A** 
> 
> The Russian economy was certainly in need of rescue in 1921, but by 1924 it had already begun to revive. From 1924, industrial reconstruction proved rapid and recovery was even more marked in agriculture. Further change from 1928 set new priorities and by 1932 the regime could boast some real achievements. Gross industrial production actually surpassed the targets set by the first five-year plan and the value of machinery more than quadrupled. These were impressive results and while the industrialisation drive continued unrelentingly, agriculture was also transformed as peasants were brought under administrative control and collectives established. The greatest economic spurt occurred during the three good years of 1934–36. Thereafter, investments were channelled into armaments, but although agriculture lagged behind, with a major crop failure in 1936, the Soviet economy was in a strong position on the eve of war. By 1941 the USSR had closed the gap with the West and Stalin’s forced pace of industrialisation would undoubtedly contribute mightily to Soviet victory.

> After the failure of the NEP which had only managed to restore agricultural and industrial production to its 1913 level by 1928, the first three five-year plans increased industrial output considerably. This was because they brought many new resources, including the labour of former peasants, into the industrial system and used the powers of the state to direct those resources into a few chosen areas. All other aspects of the economy were downplayed or neglected: agriculture, housing, retail trade, services and consumer industries. This could not last: even industrial workers needed those neglected sectors of the economy, without which their work and lives suffered. Even some heavy industries – chemical and electric, for example, were relatively neglected with damaging cumulative effects. The problem was that the planned economy was not really ‘planned’ at all. Construction projects were launched before anyone knew whether they could be completed, or if they would be needed when they were. Russia’s seemingly impressive economic development of the 1930s was lop-sided and unsustainable.

> The NEP, permitting small-scale capitalism after 1921, proved successful and was popular with workers and peasants, but it was ideologically unsound. Capitalism had to be destroyed by a state-led industrialisation drive. However, this could only be achieved through high levels of economic coercion directed at the ordinary workers and farmers and it worked far better in theory than in practice. Coordinating planning and meeting targets could only be achieved by imposing harsh penalties. There are numerous examples of over-optimistic planning which created a constant tension between planners and producers. The pressure to meet targets meant that every failure was liable to be interpreted as an act of economic sabotage. What on paper appeared an effortless statistical picture of growth was, in practice, a constant cycle of crisis and undisguised militaristic coercion. By 1941 Stalin’s Soviet Union had a record of extraordinary violence against the very men and women, in factories and fields, who struggled to put the economic plans into reality.

The main argument of Extract A is that the Soviet economy developed to the point where it had caught up with the west by 1941. This argument is supported by the statement that “By 1941, the USSR had closed the gap with the West”. However, I find this argument to be unconvincing for a number of reasons. The extract does make some claims which are accurate and convincing, such as the claim that the Russian economy was in need of rescue in 1921, which can be substantiated by the fact that Russian coal production and GNP was only 10% and 20% of Britain’s respectively, and the fact that gross output had reduced by over 20 million tonnes from 1913-21. However, it makes many more assertions that are much less convincing. The extract claims that “agriculture was transformed as peasants were brought under administrative control and collectives established”. This claim is largely inaccurate, as only 20% of households remained collectivised by the end of 1930, below Stalin’s target of 25% and far below the rate at which it had been in March 1930, at 58% under forced collectivisation. This shows that the majority of peasants were not brought under administrative control, and few collectives were established, and considering that the extracts argues for these factors to have contributed to Soviet industrial development, we can thus argue that the extract’s argument is unconvincing. The extract also argues that “by 1932 the regime could boast some real achievements”. Whilst the First and Second Five Year Plans did have some success, such as the doubling of coal and iron output by 1932 and the opening of the Moscow Metro in 1935, and the Volga Canal in 1937, this success was overshadowed by various failures of the plans: electricity output targets were only half achieved (the aim was a 600% increase, the reality was a 300% increase), the consumer and housing industry failed to take off, and under the Second Plan, light industry output stagnated. The extract omits these failures, which counteract the overall argument significantly. In light of the evidence to the contrary of the argument, it must be concluded that the main argument of extract A is wholly unconvincing.

The subsidiary argument of extract A is that Stalin’s economic and industrial policies were major contributors to winning World War II. This argument is supported by the statement that “Stalin’s forced pace of industrialisation would undoubtedly contribute mightily to Soviet victory”. I find this statement largely convincing. Stalin’s ‘great turn’ and his series of Five Year Plans brought a marked upturn in Soviet economic fortunes. The First Five Year Plan resulted in doubled coal and iron output, and a ⅓ increase in steel production; the Second Plan’s infrastructure achievements (as previously mentioned) were monumental and aided transport and power generation significantly. One of the main aims of the Third Plan is the most relevant to war: Stalin wanted to begin focusing on rearmament, knowing that the USSR was on the eve of war. A large proportion of resources and funds were allocated towards this aim, and it paid off - the Russian army were well equipped for war in 1941. These achievements clearly show that Stalin’s economic policies contributed greatly to a Soviet victory, and therefore support the subsidiary argument. A limitation, however, is the agricultural policy failure of Stalin in the form of collectivisation, which meant that the army were not fed as well as they needed to be to maintain an efficient fighting force. However, this limitation is somewhat mitigated, because this was partly out of Stalin’s control - the major crop failure in 1936 was due to weather conditions and poor harvest, rather than incorrect agricultural policies. Therefore, it can still be successfully argued that Stalin’s contribution to Soviet victory in World War II was large, and the subsidiary argument of extract A remains largely convincing.

Extract A, on the whole, is only partially convincing. The main argument fails to be so, due to the failures of Stalinist economic and agricultural policies in catching up to the West by 1941. However, the subsidiary argument redeems the extract to an extent, because it is convincing its argument that Stalin contributed greatly to Soviet victory in World War II. 

The main argument of extract B is that Stalinist-era economic policies only partially succeeded in their aims. This argument is supported by the statement that “The first three five year plans increased industrial output considerably… all other aspects of the industry were downplayed or neglected”. I find the argument to be wholly convincing, as there is strong evidence in support of it. Indeed, industrial output increased significantly, with Iron and Coal output doubling and steel output increasing by ⅓. However, electricity production only increased by 300%, half of the target set in 1928 of 600%; chemical production and light industry faltered, with consumer goods and housing seeing very little significant increase in output. Many industrial workers lived in barracks or slums, and their lack of housing and availability of consumer goods meant that their productivity was significantly hindered. Indeed, the extract claims that “even industrial workers needed these neglected sectors of the economy, without which their work and lives suffered”. This significantly supports the argument, because it demonstrates how there was success in some areas of the economy, but very little in others. Thus it can be concluded that the main argument is wholly convincing.

The subsidiary argument of extract B is that central economic planning was not at all planned, which is supported by the statement that “the planned economy was not really ‘planned’ at all”. I find this argument to be highly convincing. The extract also claims that “Construction projects were launched before anyone knew whether they could be completed”. A prime example of this is that of ‘Magnitogorsk’. Building of this huge industrial complex in a remote area near the Ural mountains began in 1929, before the architect had even finished his plans. The industrial city began production half-built, with a small, unskilled workforce, living in harsh conditions. Production targets were not met, and many died whilst undertaking dangerous work. Magnitogorsk is the most extreme example, but industrial areas such as this sprang up around Russia under Stalin, with little direction on what they were to produce, how much, and how. This is clear evidence that the economy was unplanned, and so the subsidiary argument can be shown to be highly convincing.

Extract B is entirely convincing in both arguments. The failure of the Five Year Plans to meet their targets shows that, whilst some areas of the economy saw success, even those that were specifically targeted as areas for development such as chemical production and light industry failed to meet their production goals. Furthermore, the subsidiary argument succeeds, exemplified by the failures of large industrial production hubs such as Magnitogorsk.

The main argument of extract C is that the coercion that was necessary to increase economic productivity at the same time failed to achieve its aims. Supported by the statement that “[an industrialisation drive] could only be achieved through high levels of economic coercion… it worked far better in theory than in practise”, I find this argument to be, on the whole, relatively convincing. There is substantial evidence for the failure of this strategy. Many of those who did not cooperate with state grain requisitioning or similar practises were accused of being a ‘kulak’, labelled an enemy of the state, and then deported or executed. However, not only did this policy remove approximately 10 million of the best farmers, but it scared regular peasants away from producing any surplus. Some even went so far as to kill 30% of their livestock in the mid-1930s in order to prevent the Kulak label being placed upon them. This significantly damaged the economic and agricultural productivity of Russia. This clearly demonstrates how counter-productive the methods used to promote rapid industrialisation was. Furthermore, collectivisation is another good example: what started at first as a mandatory policy had to be reduced to voluntary participation, due to a large amount of peasant uprisings and lack of cooperation. By the end of 1930, only 20% of households were collectivised, down from 58% in March 1930. This again shows how forced cooperation resulted in the opposite of what was desired, and reinforces the argument. Thus, we may conclude that the main argument of extract B is wholly convincing.

The subsidiary argument of extract C is that the NEP was a successful policy. This argument is supported by the statement that “The NEP, permitting small-scale capitalism after 1921, proved successful”. However, I find this statement to be extremely unconvincing. The NEP, despite being popular with some, primarily those who benefitted from the allowance of small-scale capitalism, dubbed NEPmen, was largely an economic failure. Only 50% of peasants were capable of producing a surplus at this time, and so at least half were unable to move past subsistence farming and sell their produce for profits. The middle class remained small, although profitable. Add to this the Scissors Crisis of 1923, in which industrial prices skyrocketed whilst agricultural prices stagnated, causing a major imbalance, and we can see all the makings of a major economic failure, a conclusion which supports the subsidiary argument of the extract.

Overall, extract C is only partially convincing. Whilst the main argument is very convincing, the argument being heavily supported by a wealth of evidence in favour, the subsidiary argument on the topic of the NEP makes claims that can be debased relatively easily, with hard evidence. Thus the extract is only partially convincing when taken as a whole.
