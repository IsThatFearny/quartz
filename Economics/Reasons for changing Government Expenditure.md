Reasons for changing Government Expenditure ^bhErjMKu

In the UK, the government spends most of their budget on pensions and welfare benefits, followed
by health and education. Income tax is the biggest source of tax revenue in the UK.

Education spending in the UK has remained relatively constant. This is because it is protected so
it does not fall, but it also does not increase much either.

Social security payments are payments from the government to assist those who have low incomes.
After the war, people saw this as necessary, so there has been a general increase in spending.

Defence spending in the UK is falling. This is the area the government spends the least on.  ^hhyagX3h
