# Perfect Competition

</br>

### The assumptions of Perfect Competition

- Homogenous goods
	- All goods sold in the market are identical in size, quality and utility
- Lots of substitutes
	- Lots of rival sellers in the market
	- If the firm changes price, they will either price themselves out or not make enough to cover their costs
	- An individual must accept the market price
- No barriers to entry or exit
	- Firms have no cost to enter or leave a market
	- This allows for ‘hit and run’ tactics
- Perfect information
	- Consumers know everything about the quality and price of the firm’s product, and about their competitors
	- Producers know everything rival firm’s output, prices, production methods, profits


The key aspect of a perfectly competitive market is that firms have no market power.

- Supply increases
- Price is driven up
- Therefore profits are increased and more firms join the market
- These new entries cause supernormal profit to return to normal

### Perfect competition in the long run

- A firm will not make any supernormal profit in the long run, it will remain making normal profit
- However, in the long run, a firm will be operating at productive and allocative efficiency
</br>


### Why is perfect competition desirable?

- Removal of inefficient firms
- Low prices
- Market is responsive to demand and supply side effects
- Community surplus is maximised
- Productive and allocative efficiency are achieved

### Why is perfect competition undesirable?

- Assumptions are unrealistic
- No product differentiation so bad/boring for consumers
- No profit probably means no R&D - this means no dynamic efficiency
- Externalities are not accounted for so there may still be negative effects on third parties in production or consumption

</br>

### The ‘shut down point’

- Firms in perfect competition will only shut down if they fail to cover their average variable costs in the short run
- This is because they will have fixed costs in the short run which they need to pay
- In the long run, firms need to cover the average costs otherwise they will not break even
