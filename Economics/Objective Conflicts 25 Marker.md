# Objective Conflicts 25 Marker

> Throughout 2021 and 2022, the UK suffered from supply-side problems which caused prices to rise. Within an economic cycle, there are often trade-offs between different macroeconomic objectives. However, many economists argue that the government should do more to reduce the likelihood of these trade-offs persisting in the long run.

When managing economic policy, governments must consider their macroeconomic objectives: low inflation, a satisfactory current account balance, full employment, and economic growth. However, in the long-run, these objectives may conflict, and governments may have to implement new policy to resolve these conflicts. This essay shall explore how governments can reconcile these conflicts, and how successful these policies are, and shall conclude that the best policies to preemptively reconcile conflicts are supply-side policies, because they tend to have little effect on inflation and increase long-run productivity of the economy.

A common conflict is between economic growth and inflation. It is natural that as the rate of economic growth increases, the rate of inflation increases alongside it. This is as a result of an increase in AD (shown on the diagram below by a rightward shift in the AD curve from AD1 to AD2), which drives the price level of the economy upwards (from P1 to P2). Governments want to maintain positive economic growth without inflation, as inflation prevents domestic consumers from seeing the benefits of the economic growth. There are few demand side policies that would be effective in this situation, because demand-side policies require a trade off - to bring inflation down, growth must be sacrificed. Therefore, the most effective type of policy in this scenario will be supply-side policies. For example, governments could subsidise commonly bought goods, which would reduce their price and thus bring aggregate demand down, reducing the price down from P2 back to the equilibrium of P1. Further, the government could subsidise education and training. This would improve long-run supply, because it would lead to an increase in productive capacity, which will allow growth to be maintained, if not improved, whilst inflation is decreased. This can be shown on the diagram below by a right shift in the LRAS curve, which will return the price level to the equilibrium point of P1, and increase Real GDP from Q1 to Q3. Thus, in this situation, it can clearly be seen that supply-side policies are more effective in reconciling these macroeconomic objective conflicts, as demand-side policies such as manipulation of fiscal policy will cause sacrifice of one policy to achieve another.

Another common conflict is inflation and low employment. If inflation is high, then costs for businesses go up, causing the demand for labour to decrease, in turn causing rising unemployment. One solution to this is to stimulate demand, by using expansionary fiscal policy: lower taxes will help people to consume more, improving the profits of businesses and expanding the demand for labour, which will decrease unemployment. However, expansionary fiscal policy has the side effect of increasing inflation, which means that the two objectives remain in conflict. Likewise, contractionary policy to combat inflation will lead to higher employment, as the demand for labour will decrease. This relationship can be demonstrated on the Phillips curve below - as inflation is decreased from I1 to I2, unemployment increases from U1 to U2, and vice versa.

Thus, again governments must turn to supply-side policies to resolve this conflict. One policy that could be used to improve unemployment without affecting the inflation rate is improvements in education provision and training. If workers are more skilled, then they are more likely to be employed, reducing unemployment. The result of this can be seen on the diagram below: the opportunity cost of high employment:inflation will be decreased because workers are more likely to find employment - when compared to that above, it is clear that the opportunity cost has decreased. Instead of an inflation rate of I1 resulting in an unemployment rate of U1, an inward shift in the Phillips curve brings unemployment down to U3, and vice versa. Furthermore, the government could choose to lower the minimum wage, causing firms to demand more labour because they are able to maintain similar profit margins. This will lower inflation, and will reconcile the trade-off. It must be considered, however, that this depends on how willing workers are to work for a lower wage. It can thus be concluded that in this scenario, too, supply-side policies are the most effective option to manage conflicts in the long-run.

A third common macroeconomic conflict is between low unemployment and a stable current account balance. If people are better off financially because they are employed, then they have a higher Marginal Propensity to Import, leading to a larger current account deficit (or a decrease in the current account surplus). Therefore, the government must intervene to maintain a stable current account balance. They can achieve this by implementing contractionary fiscal policy: higher taxes and less government spending will decrease the Marginal Propensity to Import of the population, and will bring the balance back into equilibrium. However, this will also likely affect domestic industry, and will reduce the supply of the country, causing a reduction in exports as well as imports, possibly exacerbating the trade deficit rather than resolving it. As well as this, contractionary fiscal policy is likely to increase unemployment because firms make workers redundant to save costs. Therefore, for a third time, it can be seen that demand-side government policy is ineffective in resolving conflicts. And for a third time, it is supply-side policy that comes to our aid. The main policy which can be used in this case is devaluation. If the pound is made weaker, then the price of imports will increase, deterring people from buying them, and the price of exports will decrease, incentivising overseas consumers and investors to buy more of our exports. This will improve the current account balance whilst not negatively affecting employment - indeed, it may lead to higher employment. The government could also introduce protectionist policies such as introducing tariffs, which will lead to an improved import:export ratio, and protect domestic industries, helping to maintain full employment. Again, it can be shown that supply-side policies are the better solution in this circumstance.

In conclusion, all three conflicts above are best resolved by supply-side policies such as subsidies, improved education, and foreign trade measures (e.g. devaluation and protectionism). Demand-side policies often exacerbate these conflicts, whereas supply-side policies only affect one objective at a time, and if they affect the other, it is usually in a positive way. Therefore, we may conclude that the best way to reconcile macroeconomic objective conflicts in the long run is through the use of supply-side policy.
