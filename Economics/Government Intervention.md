# Government Intervention

</br>

## Indirect Taxation

An indirect rax is imposed on producers (suppliers) by the government. Examples include duties on cigarettes, alcohol, fuel, and also VAT. Taxes have the impact of changing the allocation of resources - they signal for consumers and producers to change their behaviour. They can be used to reduce the impact of externalities. 


An indirect tax is placed on the selling price of a product. It raises the firm’s costs of production. It shifts the supply curve by the amount of tax.

There are two types of indirect taxation:

#### Specific tax

A fixed amount of tax that is imposed on a product e.g. a tax of £1 per unit sold

#### Ad Valorem

The tax is a percentage of the price, e.g. VAT. The amount of tax will rise as the price increases

### Burden/Impact of Taxation
</br>

#### Government

The government is the only stakeholder that gains. It receives revenue from the tax

</br>

#### Consumers and Producers

The amount of tax passed on to consumers depends on PED.

##### Relatively Inelastic PED

When PED is relatively inelastic, the indirect tax will be paid mainly by the consumer.

##### Relatively Elastic PED

</br>

### Evaluation of indirect taxes

#### Advantages

- Cost of negative externalities is internalised in the price of the good
- Revenue is gained to offset the externality

#### Disadvantages

- It can be difficult to put a monetary value on the cost of the externality
- If PED is inelastic demand will not be reduced
- An increase in costs of production may reduce business competitiveness
- Loss of consumer surplus/welfare/inequitable

</br>

## Subsidies

A subsidy is an amount of money given directly to firms by the government to encourage production and consumption. A subsidy increases supply and reduces price.

##### Relatively Inelastic Subsidy

#### Advantages

- The cost of externalities is internalised - it is covered by the subsidy
- Consumer preferences can be changed

#### Disadvantages

- Opportunity cost of government spending - they will have to raise revenue or borrow
- A subsidy will have little impact if PED is inelastic

</br>

## Regulation

These are rules that are enforced by a government and usually backed up with legislation. They are used to control the activities of consumers and producers and change behaviour.
</br>

### Evaluation of Regulation

- Expensive for firms to make changes - can increase costs of production and reduce competitiveness
- Monitoring firms to ensure they are following the legislation is expensive
- Regulation may be too strict, or not strict enough
- Might be unpopular politically
</br>

### Education - reducing information failure

Education about the costs and benefits of consuming demerit and merit goods can help to reduce market failure. This can happen through advertising.

#### Advantages

- Successful campaigns can change behaviour in the longer term

#### Disadvantages

- It can take many years for people to change their behaviour
- Opportunity cost for the government
</br>

### Direct Provision

A government will directly provide the good that they believe society needs.

#### Advantages

- This is the only way that the good/service would be provided
- Allows the government to gain efficiency of a large scale operation

#### Disadvantages

- The cost will have to be paid by the tax payer or government borrowing
- There may be an opportunity cost
- The intervention may fail due to the government not fully understanding the problem.

## Price Controls

### Maximum prices/price ceiling

A maximum price may be set to increase consumption of a merit good or make a necessity more affordable.

E.g. Energy price caps, CEO pay/bonuses limits, etc.

##### Evaluation

- Excess demand is a problem
- May lead to unfairness - some not able to purchase the product - rationing
- Black/parallel market may develop - some people will be prepared to pay a higher price

### Minimum price/price floor

These price floors are most commonly associated with minimum wages in the labour market or guaranteed price support schemes for farmers or other producers
