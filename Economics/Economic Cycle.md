# Economic Cycle

The economic cycle is when GDP growth fluctuates around the trend or underlying growth rate.
</br>

## The Four Stages
</br>

### 1) Boom

Output (GDP) rises strongly and unemployment falls (maybe close to full employment). Inflation at or above target.

### 2) Slowdown

Output is rising but at a slower rate. Unemployment rate stops falling. Disinflation may occur.

### 3) Recession

Output falls over two successive quarters. Rising unemployment. Disinflation or possible deflation.

### 4) Recovery

Output starts to rise again. Unemployment peaks. Return of inflation.
