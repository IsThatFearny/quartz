# Monetary Policy

</br>

## Impact of monetary policy on the exchange rate

### Hot Money Flows

- Changes in the base rate will affect exchange rates due to changes in "hot money" flows.
- 'Hot Money Flows' are when investors transfer their holdings of currency to take advantage of higher interest rates
##### Decrease in interest rate
- A fall in the interest rate will likely lead to a fall in the domestic currency (depreciation)
- This is because foreign investors will transfer their deposits to higher interest paying banks abroad
- This means that Pounds will be sold, which will increase supply and decrease the value of the currency relative to others

##### Increase in interest rate

- A rise in the interest rate will likely lead to an increase in the domestic currency (appreciation)
- This is because foreign investors will transfer their deposits from lower interest paying countries to UK banks. This means Pounds will be bought, which will increase demand and increase the value of the currency relative to others

##### Summary

- A decrease in the interest rate, ceteris paribus, should lead to a fall in the exchange rate (depreciation)
- This will lead to both demand-pull and cost-push inflation

- An increase in the interest rate, ceteris paribus, should lead to a rise in the exchange rate (appreciation)
- This will lead to both demand-pull and cost-push deflation

## The Quantity Theory

- The theory of Quantitative easing rests on the idea that inflation is influence by the money supply
- The relationship between the money supply and the price level is given by the ‘fisher equation’, $mv = pt$, where M = money supply, V = velocity of money, P = price level, and T = output

### Monetarists vs Keynesians

- Monetarists believe that the money supply is the only determinant of inflation - if you increase the money supply then prices will rise (given a lag time)

- Keynesians believe that inflation depends on the economic cycle, e.g. increases in money supply do not always feed through to consumers

## Evaluating Monetary Policy
</br>

When evaluating monetary policy, we must consider:

- The size of the change in the interest rate 
- The size of the output gap
- Confidence levels amongst consumers and firms
- Banks willingness to lend and pass on lower rates
- How quickly the transmission mechanism can take effect
