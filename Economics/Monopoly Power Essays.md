# Monopoly Power Essays


> Critics of the world’s five most valuable multinational technology firms (Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft) argue that there ought to be greater government intervention to protect consumers’ interests. Several European governments are considering imposing new taxes on the revenues of such firms, rather than their profits.

Imposition of a tax can serve multiple purposes: to increase government revenue, deter the consumption of a good, or to reduce inequality. In this case, it is indirect taxes which are levied (because it is on a good or a service), such as VAT. This will have a significant effect on consumer and producer surplus.

If a tax has unitary elasticity, then the consumer and producer surplus will be equal, because firms face the same burden as a result of the tax as the consumer. This changes depending on the elasticity of the good or service. If it is price inelastic, then an increase in the price as a result of an indirect tax such as VAT will cause the consumer surplus to decrease, and the producer surplus to increase, because consumers will continue to consume the good at a higher price, even if it is to their detriment. The opposite will occur if the good or service is price elastic: consumption will decrease as the price increases, and so the producer surplus decreases, and the consumer surplus increases - firms have to absorb more of the costs in order to maintain the level of demand that allows them to remain in the market. The three diagrams below demonstrate this. The first diagram represents unitary elasticity, the second high inelasticity, and the third high elasticity. The blue shaded areas represent the producer surplus, and the red shaded areas the consumer surplus. A shift in the supply curve from S1 to S2 as a result of levying an indirect tax will cause the price of the good or service to increase from P1 to P2, and the quantity to decrease from Q1 to Q2, and the consumer/producer surpluses to change as previously explained.

> Discuss whether governments should consider increasing the regulation and taxation of technology firms which have acquired significant global monopoly power. [25 marks]

In recent years, various ‘big tech’ firms such as Meta, Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc. have risen to dominate the global technology market in their various fields. This has raised the question of whether increased monopoly regulation is required in order to allow consumers more choice in which firms they consume from. This essay shall argue that more regulation and taxation is required to limit the monopoly power of these firms across the world to prevent the exploitation of consumers. Many of these firms have monopoly power in their respective fields, i.e. they have over 25% market share in a global market. Apple dominates the market for mobile phones, Microsoft for computers, Google for the internet, and Meta for social media. A market in which there is a monopoly supplier creates a situation in which consumers’ choice is reduced, and they may be forced to pay high prices (monopoly firms are price-makers, especially if they are an absolute monopoly - they can drive the price as high as they wish - to an extent - without fear of being undercut by other firms). Governments may therefore wish to increase regulation and taxation in order to prevent this exploitation.

Increasing the amount of regulation that monopolies are subject to can be achieved in multiple ways. One way that regulation can be increased is through setting price ceilings. A government can set a limit to the prices that a firm can sell their goods and services at. This prevents firms with price-making power from increasing their prices to the point where it is detrimental to consumers, and reduces exploitation. This is shown on the diagram below. The price at which monopolies are able to sell at without government intervention is represented by Pe. The price ceiling is represented by P2. This shows a clear decrease in the price that consumers are charged, decreasing their exploitation by firms with monopoly power.

There are some disadvantages to this method. Firstly, the government must set the price ceiling at the right price - if it is too low, then they might force the monopoly out of business, because they are not making the revenue required to break even and remain in the market in the long run. Failure to do this will lead to government failure. To ensure that this is correctly implemented, research must be undertaken, which will have extra costs for the government, as will the implementation and enforcement of the price ceiling. However, despite these disadvantages, the increase in regulation will cause a net welfare benefit, because consumers are protected from exploitation by firms with monopoly power, and, if the price ceiling is set in the right place, firms are able to continue making profits (although at a slightly reduced level).

Taxation can also be used to regulate monopolies. Monopolies can cause market failure (as shown in the diagram below - the deadweight loss is shown by the shaded area). To rectify this, the government can levy windfall taxes on these firms. Recent examples abound - the UK government has levied high windfall taxes on major monopolies in the energy sector, taking back some of the supernormal profits that these firms make out of exploitation of consumers. This extra government revenue can be used to provide subsidies on goods produced by monopoly firms, or to use on other public spending initiatives. This will reduce the effect of the market failure caused by monopolies, and decrease the net welfare loss (represented by the shaded area) that is placed on society by firms with monopoly power. The diagrams demonstrate this: the original market failure is shown by Marginal Private Benefit (MPB) outweighing Marginal Social Benefit (MSB); this is then shown to be corrected in the adjacent diagram - the gap between the MSB and the MPB has closed. If the government implements this to perfection, then the gap will be fully closed, but as this is unlikely, some level of market failure will still exist.

There is an argument to be made that windfall taxes are single-use, and their frequent use may cause firms to leave the domestic economy. In certain countries, such as the US, the investment of tech firms is too great to risk losing, and so taxation would have to be managed very carefully in order to prevent a loss of investment from these firms. Additionally, as previously mentioned, it is usually very difficult for firms to completely remove market failure from a market, and so taxation is not a perfect solution. However, its use brings about a net positive change, and therefore it should be encouraged in order to prevent the market failure that arises from firms with monopoly power.

It must be noted that, because these firms hold global monopoly power, a regulation/taxation campaign from individual countries will not have a large effect. The source of many tech firms’ monopoly power is that they have a large user base across the world, and so they can reallocate resources from one country to another to maintain their market share. Any effort to regulate and tax monopolies must be cohesive from one country to another. Whilst some may argue that this is difficult to achieve, we need only look to the EU for an example - recently, Apple was accused of being anti-competitive and abusing their monopoly power by producing all of their iPhones with specific charging ports, and the EU introduced legislation to force all phones bound for Europe to be manufactured with regulation USB-C ports, to allow consumers to have more choice in buying chargers (complimentary goods to phones). This is a good example of collective regulation that is effective.

In conclusion, despite some drawbacks, the regulation and taxation of tech firms which hold global monopoly power has a net benefit to consumers, who are protected from exploitation. Whilst regulation already exists, market failure still arises, and so more regulation such as price ceilings and windfall taxes must be introduced to reduce this. As long as governments are prudent in formulating such regulation, then these policies will reduce the market power of monopolies even further.
