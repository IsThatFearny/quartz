Determinants of Aggregate Demand - Consumer Spending ^iR5GMGnU

Consumer spending is the largest component of AD, and is therefore the most significant to economic
growth, making up approx. 60% of GDP.

Disposable income is the amount of income consumers have left over after taxes and social security
charges - this is the income that consumers can choose to spend. Consumer income might come from
wages, savings, pensions, benefits, or investments

A consumer's Marginal Propensity to Consume is how much a consumer changes their spending following a
change in income, and a consumer's Marginal Propensity to Save is the proportion of each additional
pound of household income that is used for saving. MPC + MPS = 1 ^4fCTPQHR

Consumption + Investment + Gov. Spending + (Exports - Imports) ^iPGBlBfC

Influences on Consumer Spending ^kKLHwhh1

Interest Rates: If interest rates are lowered, it is cheaper to borrow and reduces the incentive to
save, so spending and investment increase. However, there are time lags between the change in interest
rates and the rise in AD, so this is not suitable if a rise in AD is needed immediately. Lower interest
rates also lower the cost of debt, such as mortgages, which increases the effective disposable income
of households.

Consumer confidence: If consumers and firms have higher confidence levels, then they will invest and spend
more, because they feel as though they will get a higher return on their spending/investments. This can be
affected by anticipated income and inflation. If consumers fear unemployment or higher taxes, consumers
may feel less confident about the economy, so they are more likely to spend less and save more, which
delays large purchases such as houses or cars. ^CQCDFRXL
