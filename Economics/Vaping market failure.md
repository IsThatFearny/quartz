# Vaping market failure

</br>

## Assess the effectiveness of the proposed ban on disposable vapes for reducing market failure

</br>

### Point 1

- A ban reduces the supply of vapes. By removing supply, demand is also removed, and all externalities from vaping are no longer existent.

#### Evaluation

- There is the possibility of the emergence of a black market, which would meant that the externality is not entirely removed.
