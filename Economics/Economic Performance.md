# Economic Performance

</br>

## Causes of Economic Growth

1) Short run economic growth ("actual growth") - an increase in real GDP due to an increase in AD

2) Long run economic growth ("potential growth") - an increase in the productive capacity of the economy (LRAS)

</br>

## Growth and Productivity

- Productivity is output per worker per hour (the efficiency of production)
- Greater productivity means we can produce more good with the resources we have available. It also lowers unit costs of production which can lead to lower prices
- By improving the quality of its factors of production, e.g. through spending on education and training or research into new technologies.
