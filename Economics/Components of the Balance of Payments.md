# Components of the Balance of Payments

</br>

### The relationship between the accounts

- The current account is always offset by the capital and financial account so that the sum of these accounts - the balance of payments - is zero
- Countries that run deficits spend more on imports than they earn from exports and borrow from the rest of the world to make up the difference.
- Conversely, surplus economies earn more from exports than they pay for imports; they lend the difference abroad, accumulating claims on foreigners in the process

### Causes of a Current Account Deficit (M > X)

- Overvalued exchange rate
- Decline in export (manufacturing) sector
- Higher inflation
- Uncompetitive exports
- High consumer spending

</br>

### Curing a Current Account Deficit

- Deflation: contractionary monetary/fiscal policy which reduce AD. This is an expenditure reducing method
- Direct controls: import controls - tariffs/quotas and supply side policy. Expenditure switching policy.
- Devaluation: lowering the exchange rate via formal devaluation. Expenditure switching policy

### Impact of using devaluation to reduce a Current Account deficit#

- The Marshall-Lerner Condition and the J-Curve Effect - an economic model that shows the impact on the countryâ€™s balance of trade following a currency devaluation/depreciation - the trade balance worsens before it gets better
- The J-Curve is an example of how time lags can affect economic policy. It also shows the link between microeconomic principles (elasticity) and macroeconomic outcomes (current account)

![[J-Curve]]

</br>

The J-curve is caused by time lags such as:

- Ongoing contracts - firms cannot take advantage of the currency devaluation immediately
- In the short run buyers may not be responsive to the currency devaluation so continue to buy imports at higher prices
- Lack of information means that firms are not fully aware of the currency devaluation or its relevance to them

</br>

Devaluation/depreciation will only have an impact on the deficit in the *Marshall-Lerner Condition* holds. It will only work to reduce a deficit if the PED for imports plus the PED for exports is *greater than 1*.
