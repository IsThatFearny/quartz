What is the Basic Economic Problem? ^CYQ9MeFS

The basic economy problem is scarcity. We as humans
have unlimited wants, and yet only finite resources, and so we
must make choices about how to use these resources to best serve us  ^Wn7tfhvc

For example, if you have £1 to spend at a shop, and you can choose between
chocolate or crisps, you have to make a choice because of scarcity. This introduces
opportunity cost. ^E1FnmPXO

Opportunity Cost ^EUj6jwR5

The opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the next best alternative 
forgone. In the above example, the opportunity cost of choosing 
the crisps is the chocolate bar. 

Opportunity cost is very important to economic agents. Producers might have to
choose between hiring more staff or buying a new machine; governments may have to
choose how to allocate their budget in the best way. Neither can do both, and so
they have to make a choice between multiple options. ^ub9U6AlZ
