> Explain how the data in Extract D (Figure 2) show that in the UK, between 2004 and 2017, changes in the demand for rail travel contributed to changes in the price of rail travel.

In 2004, ticket prices, inflation (as measured by the RPI), and the amount of passenger kilometres were at a base of 100. Whilst the rise in ticket prices is partly contributed to by inflation (which rose by 45% between 2004 and 2017), it is clear that the increase in passenger kilometres (here synonymous with demand for rail travel) contributed as well. Figure 2 demonstrates that ticket prices rose by 70% during the period, and passenger kilometres rose by 60%. This proportional increase is greater than the increase in inflation, and so it can be concluded that changes in the price of rail travel were contributed significantly to by changes in the demand for rail travel.

> Extract E (lines 10-11) describes the British railway sector as a ‘natural monopoly’, which was split up into 'no less than 100 pieces' when it was privatised
> 
> With the help of a diagram, explain why breaking up a natural monopoly in rail may affect long-run average costs

A natural monopoly usually exists because there are large sunk costs involved in entering the market for the service provided, and therefore barriers to entry are very high. This means that only a firm deeply entrenched in the market has access to the infrastructure required in order to efficiently operate and make normal profits, and only that firm has access to the economies of scale required. If a natural monopoly is broken up, then these benefits are reduced: economies of scale which allow a firm to operate efficiently and reduce costs are removed, and the infrastructure that is used is split between different firms. Each firm will now have higher long-run average costs because of a lack of economies of scale and the cost of maintaining and using infrastructure. Additionally, long-run average costs will rise due to inefficiency: when railways were privatised in the UK, the disconnection between Network Rail and the train companies created extra costs in communicating between the two firms which were once part of the same entity and therefore had lower costs when communicating. Additionally, the Spanish rail network exemplifies this: Spanish rail firms ordered trains that were the wrong size for the tracks that the network used, and this arose from a miscommunication between the firm that owned the railways and the firms that ran the trains. This increased long-run average costs significantly. The increase in long-run average cost can be seen on the diagram below, demonstrated by a right shift in the LRAC curve from LRAC1 to LRAC2.

> Extract F (lines 9-10) suggests that ‘the British public really don’t care about who runs the trains; what they care about is reliability, comfort and price.’

> Use the extracts and your knowledge of economics to evaluate the case for renationalising railways in the UK.


At the present time, the British railway system is under the ownership and control of multiple different firms: Network Rail has a monopoly over the laying and maintenance of train track; and other firms such as LNER and ThamesLink operate the train services. However, there is a strong case to be made for renationalisation. In this essay, I shall evaluate whether this case is strong enough to overcome the significant advantages of privatisation, looking specifically at the profit incentive for private firms, the risk of government failure, and the costs of renationalisation, and shall conclude that keeping the railway network renationalisation would be preferable to keeping the system private.

Most private firms which operate in competitive markets have an incentive to make profit, so that they are able to pay out dividends and to achieve dynamic efficiency to re-invest in their firm to make increased profit in the long term. This profit incentive means that they cannot risk reducing profit. Therefore, prices will be kept low to avoid losing an advantage over other firms in close competition, and to maintain positive profit levels. As the diagram below shows, increasing price for train tickets will decrease demand (as demonstrated by a move from P1Q1 to P2Q2), and therefore decrease overall profit (as demonstrated by the shaded area). Additionally, services will be kept efficient, clean, and reliable, so as not to lose demand and therefore profit. This means that the consumer gets a comfortable and reliable service.

However, this profit incentive can be largely unimportant if there is little choice for consumers (i.e. the firms are monopolies). This occurs often: there are only two operators to choose from when travelling from Peterborough to London - LNER and ThamesLink - both of which offer different services, meaning that each has a monopoly over their sector of the market. This means that they can control the price to a much larger extent than is desirable for fair competition and for fairness to consumers. This is a significant limitation to privatisation, and is such a common occurrence that it is almost guaranteed to be an issue. If the industry were to be renationalised, then choice would be limited, but the price would have to be set at a fair rate due to political incentive and the ability to hold the railway operator responsible (i.e. the electorate can use their voting power to have their say over how the railways should be operated). Additionally, it can be argued that for such services, the profit incentive should not matter, as the rail network is an essential part of the infrastructure of the country. Thus, we can conclude that in this instance, privatisation is severely limited, and nationalisation is a better option.

It can be argued that there is a risk of government failure if the government were to renationalise the rail industry. This is because the lack of profit incentive, a lack of expertise, and political motivations influence the way that a government-run industry operates. Government failure results in negative externalities in consumption, as there will be a net loss to the taxpayer as their money is invested in ways that are perhaps not the most efficient. This can be seen in the diagram below, where Marginal Private Benefit outweigh Marginal Social Benefit, and there is substantial deadweight loss (the extra money that the taxpayers are paying) representing negative externalities in consumption.

However, a mitigating argument can also be proposed, namely that there is an incentive to run the trains well and efficiently, due to the political risk involved in managing such an important industry. There is a substantial chance that the decisions made in managing such an industry will affect the voting decisions of the electorate, and therefore the government will want to run the industry efficiently and reduce deadweight loss to prevent the loss of electoral support. Therefore, we may conclude that in this situation, the risks of nationalisation do not outweigh the negative aspects of privatisation, and so renationalisation remains the best method of running the railways.

Another argument against nationalisation is the costs of running the industry. As well as a large buyout cost, the burden on the taxpayer is more than likely to increase, unless the government can make budget cuts elsewhere (a rather unlikely prospect considering that most governments attempt to maximise spending where they can). If a government does not want to increase the burden on the taxpayer, or to cut spending elsewhere, then they might borrow the money in order to keep the trains running. This will worsen the budgetary position, and increase the national debt, which is a very negative consequence indeed.

However, it can be argued that the government already subsidises many firms, even the railways, and the burden to the taxpayer would not increase as much as it might do if this subsidy wasn’t provided. This means that the overall cost of renationalising would be reduced significantly, perhaps even limited simply to the one-time cost of buying out all firms involved.

Nationalisation has many benefits, the most consequential of which have been stated above. It also improves communication between industries (e.g. the separation of Network Rail and service providers has caused communication issues and therefore a reduction in efficiency). Overall, we may conclude that the mitigating factors against possible issues with renationalisation are enough to overcome the potential benefits of privatisation.
