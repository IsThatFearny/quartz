# Market Structure

</br>

## Perfect Competition

</br>

### The assumptions of Perfect Competition

- Homogenous goods
	- All goods sold in the market are identical in size, quality and utility
- Lots of substitutes
	- Lots of rival sellers in the market
	- If the firm changes price, they will either price themselves out or not make enough to cover their costs
	- An individual must accept the market price
- No barriers to entry or exit
	- Firms have no cost to enter or leave a market
	- This allows for ‘hit and run’ tactics
- Perfect information
	- Consumers know everything about the quality and price of the firm’s product, and about their competitors
	- Producers know everything rival firm’s output, prices, production methods, profits


The key aspect of a perfectly competitive market is that firms have no market power.
</br>
### Perfect Competition Diagram
![[Perfect Competition Diagrams|1000x500]]
- Supply increases
- Price is driven up
- Therefore profits are increased and more firms join the market
- These new entries cause supernormal profit to return to normal

</br>

### Perfect competition in the long run

- A firm will not make any supernormal profit in the long run, it will remain making normal profit
- However, in the long run, a firm will be operating at productive and allocative efficiency
</br>


### Why is perfect competition desirable?

- Removal of inefficient firms
- Low prices
- Market is responsive to demand and supply side effects
- Community surplus is maximised
- Productive and allocative efficiency are achieved

### Why is perfect competition undesirable?

- Assumptions are unrealistic
- No product differentiation so bad/boring for consumers
- No profit probably means no R&D - this means no dynamic efficiency
- Externalities are not accounted for so there may still be negative effects on third parties in production or consumption

</br>

### The ‘shut down point’

- Firms in perfect competition will only shut down if they fail to cover their average variable costs in the short run
- This is because they will have fixed costs in the short run which they need to pay
- In the long run, firms need to cover the average costs otherwise they will not break even


## Oligopoly
</br>

### Structure

- A few large firms control the market
- Firms must be interdependent - the actions of one directly affect another
- High barriers to entry and exit
- Goods are usually differentiated

Oligopolies are measured using *concentration ratios*. A concentration ratio measures the market share of the nth largest firms in the market and is meant to give an indication of the level of competition. The measure used can be sales, employment, or any other relevant indicator. The higher the concentration ratio, the less competitive the oligopoly is said to be.

### Competitive oligopoly

A competitive oligopoly is when oligopolies compete to try and gain market share.

#### Kinked demand curve

![[Kinked Demand Curve]]


- If a firm raises their price and another firm maintains price, then the former loses revenue
- If a firm lowers their price, other firms will follow. This will lead to a ‘price war’. Revenue falls for all firms
- Price are ‘sticky’ at P1

#### Implications for kinked demand curve

- Kinked demand curves help explain why prices are sticky, so firms return to ‘non-price competition’. This leads to better customer service, promotions/offers, and a user friendly interfaces.
- It can also explain why large amounts are spent on advertising and marketing, and demonstrates *interdependence* - why change the price and risk losing your market share?
- However, in the real world, prices do change - price wars are common in the supermarket industry
- Firms may sacrifice profit for sales in the short term
- Brand loyalty may be strong enough to allow for price rises, for example, Apple.

</br>

### Collusive oligopoly

#### Collusion can fail due to…

- Falling market demand - gives firms an incentive to lower price
- The successful entry of non-cartel firms into the industry
- The exposure of illegal price-fixing by market regulators


## Monopolistic Competition
</br>

### Assumptions of monopolistic competition

- Imperfect information
- Low barriers to entry or exit
- Slightly differentiated goods (this means that firms are price-makers because they can change the price of their goods)
- Low market concentration
- Lots of smaller sellers

### Chain of reasoning

If goods are not homogenous —> then goods are not perfect substitutes —> this causes demand to become more inelastic

### Monopolistic competition diagram

![[Monopolistic Competition Diagram]]

The outcomes of this are:

- Firms are still profit maximising
- Only normal profit (AR = AC)
- Firms are productively and allocatively inefficient

## Monopoly

</br>

A monopoly is a dominant seller of a good or service in a market. Monopolies are usually defined according to their market share:

- $>$ 25% = ‘legal’ or ‘working’ monopoly
- $>$ $40% = ‘dominant’ monopoly
- Two firms with > 80% market share combined = duopoly

A natural monopoly is a market that can only support one supplier due to the massive fixed costs involved (e.g. water companies)

</br>


### Assumptions of monopoly

- One dominant supplier
- Very different products
- Very limited information
- High barriers to entry - no hit and run tactics
- Price makers - large degree of flexibility - inelastic demand, few substitutes, brand loyalty

</br>

### Long-run monopoly

- In the long run, a monopoly will always be able to profit maximise
- Abnormal (supernormal) profit will be made and sustained, because significant barriers to entry exist

</br>

### Efficiency

- A monopoly is productively inefficient - it doesn’t produce at AC = MC
- It is also allocatively inefficient - it doesn’t produce at P = MC. This leads to deadweight loss
- However, a monopoly can be dynamically efficient - abnormal profits can lead to research and development, which leads to lower costs and/or better quality products

</br>

### Natural monopoly

- A natural monopoly occurs in markets where the fixed costs of production are very large but the marginal costs are very small
- The first firm enjoys a cost advantage as it is able to exploit economies of scale throughout its output range
- As extra users are added, ATC continues to fall
- As a result, the market can only support one firm (any more would be inefficient and a waste of resources)

## Competition Policy

Competition policy concerns actions by the government to make markets more competitive. It comprises policy towards monopolies, mergers, and restrictive trading practices. 

Governments will seek to intervene in markets to protect consumers, unless: a) economies of scale allow firms to produce at a lower average cost, or b) low entry and exit barriers allows for a degree of contestability.

</br>

### Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)

The Competition and Markets Authority is the government agency responsible for advising on and implementing UK competition policy. The CMA uses market structure, conduct, and performance indicators to check for monopoly abuse, e.g. concentration ratios and consumer complaints. Relatively few firms are investigated - in the UK the threat of regulation is seen as satisfactory.

</br>

### Monopoly Policy

- ‘Monopoly busting’ - breaking up of a monopoly (very rare - last example was the break up of the British Airports Authority in 2011)
- Use of price controls - not as popular these days (e.g. energy price capping)
- Taxing monopoly profits (e.g. windfall taxes)
- Making markets more contestable (e.g. offering subsidies to startups or deregulating)

</br>

### Merger Policy

- The term ‘merger policy’ covers all types of acquisition; friendly or hostile, willing or unwilling
- A takeover or merger is investigated if it is expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition and/or consumer exploitation

</br>

### Restrictive trading practices

- Independent restrictive practices are undertaken by a single firm, e.g. engaging in price discrimination, abusive advertising practices, or refusal to supply a particular resale outlet
- Collective restrictive practices are undertaken by a group of firms (cartel), e.g. price fixing amongst firms in a market, market sharing, or bid rigging
- If a firm is found to have acted in a way that restricts competition, it can be fined or the director of the firm disqualified
