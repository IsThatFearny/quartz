# Profit

In economic theory, firms are assumed to be profit-maximisers. This means setting output where MC = MR (this is mathematically true). However, there are other objectives which firs may pursue at various time in their growth or depending on the market in which they operate.

### The role of Profit

- Firms require at least normal profit (AR = AC) to remain in business
- Firms desire supernormal profit to allow them to re-invest into their product or processes, pay shareholderâ€™s dividends or simply as a reward for risk-taking
- Supernormal profit also acts as an incentive to join a market for those outside
- Profit is also a source of tax revenue for the government
- Some firms use profit to reward workers through performance-related pay, which can boost productivity

### Types of profit

Normal profit: the minimum level of profit required to keep entrepreneurs satisfied and remain in business. AR = AC

Supernormal profit: any profit over and above normal profit. AR > AC

Subnormal profit = any losses incurred. AR < AC

### Advantages and Disadvantages of maximising profits
