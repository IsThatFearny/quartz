# Economic Methodology and the Economic Problem

</br>

## Economics Overview

</br>

### Economics is the study of scarcity

> "Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends (unlimited wants) and scarce means (resources) which have alternative uses"
> ~ Lionel Robbins
> 

</br>

### Economics is a [[Economics/Glossary#Social Science|Social Science]]

A social science is the scientific study of human society and social relationships

</br>

### How is Economics similar to science?

1) Uses theories and models to understand Economic forces and events
2) Uses statistical data to prove a hypothesis
3) Organising Experiments to test theories

### How is it different?

1) Does not tend to use experiments to confirm ideas
2) Relies on observations of real life events in order to confirm hypothesis


</br>

## How does Economics approach the world?

</br>

### [[Economics/Glossary#Positive Economics|Positive Economics]] (Objective)

The study of *what is* and the way the world actually works. Can be tested and are statements that are provable, e.g. 'A tax on plastic carrier bags will reduce the volume of plastic waste'

</br>

### [[Economics/Glossary#Normative Economics|Normative Economics]] (Subjective)

Matters of opinion and reflect value judgements. Statement of opinion, although can be tested by facts, e.g. 'the government should increase the minimum wage to Â£15 per hour to reduce poverty'

</br>

### [[Economics/Glossary#Value Judgements|Value Judgements]]

Beliefs of individuals and societies about what is right or wrong, good or bad
</br>

### Economics and politics

Politicians will make decisions based on: 

- The views of the electorate
- Actions of pressure groups
- Views of individual politicians
- Media reports

</br>

### The Purpose of Economic Activity

The central purpose of economic activity is the production of goods and services to satisfy needs and wants. A need is something that we require to  survive (food, water, shelter, etc), whereas a want is something that would improve our lives (luxuries such as technology, nicer houses, etc.) Satisfying needs and wants means improving *economic welfare*
</br>

### [[Economics/Glossary#Economic Welfare|Economic Welfare]]

The economic well being of an individual or group within an economy
</br>
</br>


## The Economic Problem

The resources used to produce these goods and services are finite. The economic problem is about how to allocate our scarce resources when *wants are infinite*
</br>

### The Basic Economic Problem

- *What should we produce* using the factors of production at our disposal?
- *How should we produce it* given the factors of production you have access to?
- *For whom should we produce?* Who should have access to the goods and services provided

</br>

### Factors of Production

Factors of production are inputs into the production process.

-   Land - minerals, ocean, agricultural land
-   Labour - workforce
-   Capital - machinery, technology
-   Entrepreneurs  
</br>

### How might factors of production be improved to increase productivity or quantity?

-   Land - Land reclaiming, intensive farming/fishing, vertical farming, crop cycle
-   Labour - Motivation, incentive, 'happier workers are harder workers'
-   Capital - Developments in technology, purpose-made machines
-   Entrepreneurs - Higher profit for less risk, more gain from investments, subsidise small businesses  
</br>

### Rewards for factors of production
- Labour - Wages
- Land - Rent
- Enterprise - Profit
- Capital - Interest
</br>

### The environment is a scarce resource
- Renewable - Availability depends on management by humans
- Non renewable - Availability is limited

</br>

### Opportunity Cost
This is a theory that relates to the idea of scarcity. The opportunity cost of any choice or decision is measured in terms of the alternatives that have to be given up. 'The next best alternative forgone'

### Free and economic goods
A free good is a good with zero opportunity cost. This means it can be produced by society in as much quantities as needed with little or zero effort. 

An economic good is a good or service that has a benefit (utility) to society. Economic goods have a degree of scarcity and therefore opportunity cost.

</br>
</br>

## The means of answering the economic questions
</br>

### Economic Systems
The way in which an economy is organised and run, including alternative views on how resources are best allocated
</br>

### Command Economy
- Scarce resources owned by government
- Price mechanism plays little part
</br>

### Free Market
- Resources allocated by price
- Limited role for government
- Protection of property rights
</br>

### Economic Modelling - Opportunity Cost

#### Production Possibility Curve/Frontier

A PPC/F is 'a diagrammatic representation of the maximum combination of 2 products that an economy can produce when all of its resources are used efficiently in a time period'

![[PPC Graph]]

By increasing the production of guns, this country has to decrease the production of wheat.

##### Assumptions

1) Fixed Production - Only two products are made in varying combinations. It is a simplified version of real world markets
2) Scarcity - Limited and fixed amount of resources in an economy at any moment in time - there is a trade off between the 2 products
3) Constant State of Technology - Technology is held constant - in reality this would change
5) Efficiency - Resources are used in an efficient way - no waste. maximum physical output is produced

##### How can PPC's be used?

- To find opportunity cost
- To show scarcity
- Unemployment of resources
- To show efficiency

##### Constant Opportunity Cost
- A linear PPC suggests constant opportunity cost
- This is less realistic
