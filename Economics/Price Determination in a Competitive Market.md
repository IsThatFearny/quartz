# Price Determination in a Competitive Market
</br>

## Demand Theory

![[Market Demand Curve]]

</br>

###### Demand

The quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to buy at a given price in a given period of time

###### Effective Demand

Desire backed up by a willingness and ability to pay

###### Law of Demand

As a good's price falls, more is demanded
</br>

### Changes in price and their impact on demand


![[Extension and Contraction of Demand]]

#### Factors that shift demand

![[Factors that shift the demand curve]]

This graph shows the demand curve for an object

D is the normal demand curve

D2 is a decrease in demand (shift to the left)

D1 is an increase in demand (shift to the right)

</br>

### Ceteris Paribus

All other factors remaining constant (Assumptions made when drawing single demand)

Breaking it causes shifts in the curves
</br>

## Supply Theory
</br>

Supply: The willingness and ability of producers to supply output onto a market at a given price in a given period of time
</br>

### The Law of Supply

As the price of a product rises the quantity supplied of the product will usually increase

![[Supply Curve]]

![[Supply Curve (With Contraction and Extension)]]

![[Shifts of Supply]]

Rightward Shift - Increase in supply at each and every price
Leftward shift - Decrease in supply at each and every price

</br>

## Determination of equilibrium prices

The equilibrium is the price at which demand is equal to supply and there is no tendency for change.

The price in market equilibrium is the equilibrium price and the quantity is the equilibrium quantity. This is also known as the market clearing price.

## Microeconomic Disequilibrium

</br>

### Excess Demand

This is when consumers wish to buy more than firms wish to sell, with the price below the equilibrium price

### Excess Supply

This is when firms wish to see more than consumers wish to buy, with the price being above the equilibrium level

![[Excess Supply and Demand Curve]]

### Consumer Surplus

This is a measure of the welfare that people gain from consuming goods and services. There is a gain to buyers who can purchased a product at a lower price than they are willing and able to pay

### Producer Surplus

This is a measure of producer welfare. There is a gain to firms that receive a price higher than the price they are willing and able to supply at

</br>

### Inter relationships between markets

A change in one market can cause a change in the other
