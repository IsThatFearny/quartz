> [!question]
> Using the data in Extract A (Figure 1), calculate the number of workers doing weekly
> platform work in 2019 for each worker doing monthly platform work in 2019.
> 
> Give your answer to two decimal places. [**2 Marks**]

$\frac{9.6}{11.8} = 0.81$. 0.81:1 weekly:monthly platform work

> [!question]
> Explain how the data in Extract A (Figure 2) show that the incentive for workers to
> become self-employed increased between 2009/10 and 2018/19. [**4 Marks**]

In 2009/10, the median real earnings (after direct taxes) for those who were self-employed was £15,800. By 2018/19 the same measure was at £16,500, having increased in the intervening decade by £700 (accounting for changes in the price level). Meanwhile, the median real earnings after tax of those who were not self-employed decreased in the same time period, from £21,900 to £21,600. A rise in salary in self-employed industry and a decrease in salary in other industries where workers are employed by someone else is highly likely to increase the incentive to become self-employed. Whilst the salary is still higher when not self-employed, an increase in that salary will increase the amount of workers who move to self-employment, because it becomes a more attractive option.

> 
> With the help of a diagram, analyse how a trade union might achieve higher pay for its

Trade Unions achieve their goals (the main one of which is usually higher pay) by utilising ‘free collective bargaining’ - that is, the union can use the threat of a mass strike, or even carry one out, in order to force the hand of firms to pay higher wages. This is because often, trade unions hold monopoly or near-monopoly power over the supply of labour. Therefore, if workers go on strike, especially in an industry where there is high union membership, then the productive capacity of a firm will be significantly reduced in the short run. As a result of this, the revenue made by the firm will decrease as will the quantity produced, and thus the firm loses profits. This is an unsustainable position for most firms, and in the long-run they may be forced to leave the market, and as such they will be forced to negotiate with a trade union who demand higher wages. The trade unions will demand higher wages than the market equilibrium, and, if negotiations are successful, then they can raise the wage rate to Wtu, creating a new equilibrium at WtuQtu.

The ‘gig-economy’ is the term for labour markets which primarily operate by using zero-hour contracts and hourly rates, rather than a yearly salary. These workers are often either younger or the poorer in society, and it is therefore argued by some that they need due protection. Whilst it can also be argued that government intervention is unnecessary to protect the interests of these workers, this essay will argue the former view, because the gig-economy often leads to the exploitation of those working in it and this exploitation often cannot be solved by free–market forces.

As previously stated, the gig-economy primarily comprises workers who are either young and cannot work all the time (e.g. a Sunday job or a job after school/university) or those who are unable to or choose not to work in industries with consistent hours and a yearly salary (e.g. people with little education or freelance workers). The volatility of the demand for labour in these markets disadvantages workers significantly. For example, the demand for workers in a restaurant might be highest at lunch, but some younger workers are unable to work these shifts due to being in education. Therefore, they miss out on what might be the better paid shifts. Similarly, the volatility of demand for labour may cause seasonal issues: those working as sports coaches, for example, may find that their labour is only demanded in the season in which their sport is played. Therefore, they may be paid for half of the year, but get little work for the rest of the year. This disadvantages these workers significantly, and rather than being solved by free-market forces, the gig-economy is often allocatively inefficient and exacerbates the instability of the labour market. Therefore, government intervention can be introduced in order to protect the interests of these workers.

One example of government intervention that could be introduced is an improved benefits system for those in part-time work. Unemployment benefits in the UK are often only given to those who are not in work at all, and therefore those in the gig-economy may not see these benefits. This may come in the form of a subsidy towards energy bills or other essentials, or may just be monthly cheque for a certain amount. This would allow gig-economy workers to support themselves when the demand for labour is lower than they might like, e.g. in the off-season or when they cannot get any shifts in their job. This can be demonstrated in the diagram below: a worker in the gig-economy may only be able to
