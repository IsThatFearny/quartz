> **Extract B: Are energy firms exploiting their market power?**

> The UK energy market was privatised in the early 1990s and is dominated by six firms, British Gas, EDF Energy, E.ON, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE. These firms supply, produce and own energy reserves. Gas is the main source of fuel used by electricity generators. The increase in household fuel bills has been a cause of rising inflation in recent years. In autumn 2013, prices were increasing at three times the rate of inflation. Energy prices have risen faster than average earnings and 6.5 million households were spending over 10% of their incomes on energy and so experiencing ‘fuel poverty’. Are the oligopolistic energy utilities exploiting their monopoly power? Firms raise prices quickly when their wholesale costs increase, but are slow to reduce them when market conditions change. The energy regulator, OFGEM, doesn’t regulate prices or profits, but aims to promote greater competition in the market. OFGEM has found no evidence of collusion between energy suppliers to date. Wholesale energy costs are responsible for around half the final domestic bill. Suppliers buy energy on the wholesale market from energy producers. Contracts are complex and firms buy energy to cover their future needs. A generator may sell energy to a supplier within the same company before it is sold on to the consumer. The determination of wholesale prices and their link to retail prices aren’t clear. UK households faced over 1756 different price plans in early 2013. This makes it difficult for consumers to compare rates and few consumers switch supplier. In 2013 OFGEM intervened to fix the maximum number of price plans to four per firm; this should bring greater price transparency.

> Do UK consumers pay too much for energy? Department of Energy & Climate Change research shows domestic electricity prices were fourth lowest and gas prices second lowest in a survey of 15 EU countries. Firms claim profits, averaging a return of 5% in 2012, are not excessive and are used to fund much-needed investment in both infrastructure and future energy supplies. Will Morris, Group Managing Director of SSE, claims many factors are responsible for driving up prices: “Buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers, and government-imposed levies collected through bills all cost more than last year.” Ed Miliband, Leader of the Opposition in the UK, promised that a future Labour government would impose “a price freeze for twenty months because the market is not working”, and that the regulator would make the market more competitive. In the longer term, the UK needs to become less dependent on imported energy and use ‘greener’ sources such as wind, solar and nuclear. One in five UK power stations will be obsolete by 2023 and there is a risk of power shortages in coming years. The Government guarantees high prices to firms producing energy from renewable and nuclear sources but these costs are then passed on to consumers. The Government claims that high guaranteed prices for power generators makes good long-term sense. Gas prices are expected to rise over the longer term, despite the discovery of shale gas in the UK. Could more be done to encourage households to reduce their demand for energy? Energy conservation could result in lower bills but few households are making use of the ‘Green Deal’ scheme to make homes more energy efficient.

From 2009 to 2013, the amount of profit that firms have taken per bill has risen proportionally higher than costs have rise. The average household bill has risen by 24.01%, whereas the profit taken per bill has risen by 850% from £10 per bill to £95 per bill. Such a large increase, out of line with inflation of energy bills, is clear evidence of exploitation, because firms have been able to raise their prices to increase profit, which causes the costs for households to increase - this is possible because consumers have no other choice in how they supply their energy. Further to this, the fact that the costs of the energy itself makes up just over half of the overall price is another example of how firms are exploiting their power - they are overcharging consumers.

The energy industry is often oligopolistic, with very few firms involved. This is largely due to high sunk costs and high barriers to entry (only a certain amount of firms have access to the required infrastructure). This may result in collusive behaviour between suppliers, in order to make as much profit as possible. If firms collude, then they are able to raise their prices without sacrificing demand through one firm undercutting another. This means that prices across the industry will increase significantly for all firms involved in the collusive behaviour. The reasons for this can be demonstrated using Game Theory. Assuming the presence of two firms, there are four possible outcomes: 1) Firm A raises prices, Firm B lowers their price. Firm A will lose customers because Firm B is undercutting them in price; 2) Firm B raises prices, Firm A lowers their price. Ditto outcome, vice versa; 3) Both firms lower their prices, resulting in a net loss of profits for both firms; 4) Both firms raise prices, resulting in a net gain of profits for both firms. Without collusion, firms will not raise their prices, because they do not want scenario 1 or 2 to occur. If firms collude, then they are willing to raise prices, because they have an assurance that their competitors will not undercut them, and they will increase their profits. The diagram below demonstrates this: if firms lower their prices without colluding (from P1 to P3), then they will sacrifice proportionally more output, and vice versa with raising prices. If collusion takes place, then the demand curve will lose its kink, and prices will no longer be sticky at P1Q1.

Due to the naturally oligopolistic nature of the UK energy industry, significant market failure often occurs in the industry, causing the exploitation of consumers and a loss of consumer welfare. There are multiple ways to offset this market failure: through the imposition of a maximum price, as Ed Miliband suggests; by levying a windfall tax on excess profits made by energy firms; or by introducing anti-collusive measures in industries. This essay shall conclude that anti-collusion measures are the best solution to offsetting market failure, because they 

There are various ways in which the UK energy industry can cause market failure. Due to the nature of competition in the industry, which is highly oligopolistic, firms are able to raise their prices and exploit consumers. It is often difficult for consumers to change energy supplier, because a single supplier might have control of the local energy infrastructure (a natural regional monopoly), and thus consumers have no choice but to accept higher prices, short of moving elsewhere. This can be demonstrated on the diagram below, which demonstrates that the effects of raising prices on consumers: if consumers have no choice of energy supplier as a result of a regional monopoly, then firms can raise prices from P1 to P2 without risking losing any profit, as they might do in a competitive industry. This will result in market failure, as resources are not allocated correctly. This can be seen in the red shaded area, representing the consumer burden and the producer surplus. Thus, policies must be introduced to offset this, and return price to P1Q1 (the equilibrium).

One way of achieving a reduction in price is through the setting of a maximum price or price ceiling for energy costs, as has recently been seen in the UK. By setting a price which energy suppliers cannot charge above, the exploitation of consumers is prevented. The recent UK price ceiling has been moved in line with inflation, preventing major firms from raising their prices higher than is necessary. This will serve to reduce market failure significantly, as consumer exploitation will decrease substantially, due to the price-making power of firms with high market power being decreased. This can be seen in the diagram below - a price ceiling of Pmax prevents firms from raising their prices above this level, resulting in higher consumer surplus (represented by the blue shaded area).

![[Specimen Paper 1 Price Ceiling Diagram|250x250]]
However, there are various issues with the imposition of a price ceiling. Firstly, the government must set the price ceiling in the right place. If insufficient research is undertaken, then this will misinform policy-making, and may allow consumer exploitation to continue if the ceiling is set too high - the opposite may also occur, preventing firms from making sufficient profit if the ceiling is set too low, and causing government failure. Secondly, many firms may be forced to reduce their innovation and investment as a result of lower profits, because they have to continue to pay their fixed costs with lower profit margins. Despite aiding in reducing producer surplus and consumer exploitation, a price ceiling may have negative effects which are entirely undesirable for both consumers and firms. It must therefore be concluded that a price ceiling may not be an effective method of reducing consumer exploitation.

Another method in which the market failure arising from the UK energy industry could be offset is the imposition of a windfall tax on energy firms’ earnings. This has been a common policy in recent years in the UK when firms have been found to be making profits that were clearly exploitative. The revenue collected from a windfall tax can be used by the government to support those affected by exploitative prices - during the cost of living crisis in the UK, the government redistributed this income to the poorest, whose energy bills took up the highest proportion of their income across society, by subsidising their energy. This offsets the damage caused to consumers, because the burden that is placed on them (as above) is removed, and can even be turned into a consumer surplus if windfall tax revenue is high enough.

However, there are also issues with this method. Firstly, it is a one-time tax, and therefore will have to be replicated for the policy to succeed in the long-run, and if oil prices continue to increase, so will energy prices, and thus a policy which does not extend into the long-run may not be the best solution to the problem. Furthermore, windfall taxes can damage the dynamic efficiency of firms, preventing them from investing in research and development, which may be of use in bringing prices down in the long-term - for example, investment into cheap, sustainable sources of energy. Additionally, as above, if the windfall tax is levied in incorrect proportions, then government failure may occur. The potential failures of this policy cause us to conclude that windfall taxes, at least in the long-run, are damaging to efficiency and will not be able operate in perpetuity, and thus they are not the best policy to offset the market failure that exists in the energy industry.

Considering the nature of the industry - that is, highly oligopolistic - it may be argued that the reasons that firms are able to increase their prices so much is that they are colluding. The kinked demand curve model, which claims that prices are sticky at the kink in the curve, does not apply when firms are colluding, and so firms are able to increase their prices without fear of being undercut by other firms. Therefore, by introducing anti-collusion measures and legislation, the government can cause a reduction in prices by forcing the market equilibrium to remain sticky, at P1Q1 in the diagram below. Extending the powers of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), or investigating the industry more closely for illegal collusion, may both be useful policies in this effort. When wages remain sticky, consumers are charged a fair price for the industry, and the market failure resulting from high market power of the firms in the industry can be offset.

In conclusion, whilst increased regulation is sometimes argued to be an excess of government intervention, it offers better results than the use of other policies: firms remain able to maximise their various efficiencies, especially allocative efficiencies, are able to maintain normal profit and thus stay in the industry, and it establishes a long-term system of managing this market failure. This combats the negative effects of establishing a maximum price and introducing a windfall tax, and so it must be argued that the introduction of improved anti-collusive regulation is the best policy to offset the market failure caused by the UK energy industry, not the imposition of a maximum price.
