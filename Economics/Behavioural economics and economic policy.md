Choice architecture ^33uw8VC3

Choice architecture is how choices are presented to consumers.
Different designs can affect the choices that consumers make.
For example, a consumer might be offered fewer choices, to avoid
the extra time and consideration it takes to evaluate an extra
choice. A good example of choice architecture is organ donation.
Countries with an 'opt-out' system generally have higher levels of
donation than countries with an 'opt-in' system, because of the
perceived effort involved in signing in or out of the system. ^Ow19gEL7

Framing ^rmsRBODd

Framing is the way by which consumers are influenced by
how a choice is presented. For example, if consumers are
told the monthly payment for a good or service, rather
than the aggregate yearly payment, then they are more
likely to purchase the good or service because it seems
more affordable. ^fRtpkPn9

Nudges ^dMwOAZ9V

Types of Choices ^fIhhMIwC

A default choice is when a consumer is automatically enrolled
into a system, such as a pension scheme. Consumers are more
likely to participate when they are automatically enrolled.

A restricted choice is akin to the example of junk/healthier food:
the choice is restricted, but it is still there.

A mandated choice is when consumers are required to state whether
they wish to participate in an action. ^LzECpVSS

Nudges aim to change the behaviour of consumers
without taking away their freedom of choice. For
example, rather than banning something like junk
food, replacing it with a healthier food is a nudge.
This still allows consumers to make a free choice,
but it alters their behaviour to choose the healthier
option.

It is sometimes argued that nudges are manipulative
and consumers do not get a free choice. However, due
to imperfect information that exists between consumers
and firms, nudges can help prevent consumers making
irrational or poor choices, so their welfare is maximised.
