# Protectionism

Protectionism is economic policy to impose restrictions on trade in goods and services.

### Why use protectionist policy?

- To protect domestic industries from outside competition
- To maintain employment for the domestic population
- To decrease a current account deficit (M > X) â€“> AD
- To increase government revenue

### Tariffs

- Tax on imports - imports duty/customs duty
- Often used as a deliberate attempt to restrict imports
- Likely to raise final price to consumer/firms.

![[Tariff Impact]]


#### Impacts on Stakeholders

##### Domestic Producers

- Increase production (from Q1-Q3. Extension of supply)
- Their revenue increases PxQ
- Producer surplus increases
- Area d is inefficient production by domestic firms

##### Foreign producers

- They will tend to lose out - lower price and a reduced amount
- Before tariff: They sold Q1-Q2
- After tariff: They sold Q3-Q4

##### Consumers

- There is a contraction in demand
- They now pay a higher price so consumer surplus is lost
- There is an impact on discretionary income

###### The Government

- After the tariff, the amount imported is Q3 to Q4


### With International Trade

#### Winners

- Foreign producers
- Domestic consumers
	- Low prices
	- Better quality goods
- Foreign economies

#### Losers

- Domestic producers
	- Increased competition leads to loss of revenue
- Domestic economy
	- Increased Leakages

</br>

### With tariffs

#### Winners

- Government
	- Gains revenue from the tariff
- Domestic producers
	- Increased revenue

#### Losers

- Domestic consumers
	- Loss of consumer surplus
	- Increased prices
- Foreign producers
	- Loss of import market and revenue

</br>

### Why introduce a tariff?

- Promote domestic competition
	- Higher import prices make bargain-seeking consumers buy domestic goods, as they are now available at a lower price to their competitors
- Increased government revenue
	- The tariffs paid go straight to the government, and they gain increased revenue
- Decrease current account deficit
	- Increasing exports and decreasing imports will decrease the current account deficit, which is healthy for the overall economy
</br>

### Non-Tariff Barriers

#### Quotas

- A physical limit on the quantity of an imported good
- Excess demand is created leading to an increase in price
- The increase in price leads to an increase in supply - domestic producers enter the market

##### Winners

- Domestic firms
	- An increase in supply causes an increase in revenue
- Domestic economy
	- An increase in employment
- Government may receive a license fee
- May reduce current account deficit

##### Losers

- Foreign firms
	- Lose market
	- Lose revenue
- Consumers
	- Prices are higher, so consumers pay higher prices
	- Loss of consumers surplus

</br>

#### Quotas

- Financial assistance to help domestic firms compete against foreign imports by lowering the costs of production
- Helps to protect local jobs
- Helps to make firms more competitive

Two types:
- Production subsidies - most common form
- Export subsidies - targeted at protecting specific export orientated firms

##### Winners

- Domestic firms
	- More money provided to produce more/innovate more
- Foreign consumers
	- More imports for foreign consumers, more variety

##### Losers

- Government
	- Government loses money by subsidising firms
- Taxpayers
	- Subsidies are raised from taxpayer money

</br>
### Administrative barriers

Red tape: if import processes are lengthy and complicate they can act as a restriction to imports

Health and safety/environmental standards: these regulations may restrict the import of goods

Embargoes: extreme quotas. A complete ban on imports


</br>

### World Trade Organisation

- The WTO is a forum for governments to negotiate trade agreements
- It is a place for them to settle trade disputes
