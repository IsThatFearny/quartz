# Low profits and management 25 marker

</br>

**Reasons for low profits:** Poor management; government regulation; lack of demand (cyclical); high levels of competition; diseconomies of scale

#### Paragraph 1: Poor management

- Profit satisficing - if management has no incentive to increase profits, then they will cause the firm to produce to a point where the owners and shareholders are satisfied. This will cause lower profits because they are not at productive efficiency
- Principal-agent problem - if worker’s/manager’s bonuses are linked to revenue, then the firm will produce at the revenue max point for personal gain, rather than profit max
- Poor investment choices - if the firm has made investment choices which do not pay off (e.g. poor quality technology, risky assets, etc.) then their profits will be low

#### Paragraph 2: Government intervention and regulation

- Government intervention (e.g. price ceilings, environmental regulation, etc.) can cause profits to be lower. A price ceiling, for example, will prevent a firm from raising their price to the profit max point, and therefore they will make lower profit than they would wish. Similarly, a government might introduce output-restricting measures, also preventing profit maximisation and causing lower profits
	- Government intervention is often justified and applies market-wide. Low profit would usually only arise from poor implementation of regulation, causing government failure
- Protectionism - the introduction of protective measures on imports of raw materials, for example, will cause firms’ costs to increase. If they choose to pass these costs on to the consumer, then demand will decrease and the firm will make lower profits; if the firm chooses to absorb the costs, then they will *still* make lower profits as the ratio of cost:revenue will increase.

#### Paragraph 3: Lack of demand (cyclical causes)

- In a recession, demand for a firm’s goods and services may be reduced, as a result of people not having enough money to buy these goods. This is especially true if the goods produced are luxury goods, meaning that their demand is more income elastic. A decrease in demand will mean that people are buying less, and if they are buying, they are buying at lower prices, causing a loss of profit to the firm
	- Cyclical causes can apply to all firms across an industry - this means that profit will not be low when compared to other firms
- Lack of demand can also be caused by non-price factors, e.g. a better advertising campaign by another firm
- If a complement good for a firm’s good or service increases in price, or a substitute decreases in price, then demand for that good will decrease, leading to a loss of profits
	- Again, can be market wide

#### Conclusion

- Poor management is often not the cause, although it can be.
- Other external factors have more of an impact and are more often the case, such as a lack of demand (caused by multiple factors) or increased government regulation.
