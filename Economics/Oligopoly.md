# Oligopoly
</br>

### Structure

- A few large firms control the market
- Firms must be interdependent - the actions of one directly affect another
- High barriers to entry and exit
- Goods are usually differentiated

Oligopolies are measured using *concentration ratios*. A concentration ratio measures the market share of the nth largest firms in the market and is meant to give an indication of the level of competition. The measure used can be sales, employment, or any other relevant indicator. The higher the concentration ratio, the less competitive the oligopoly is said to be.

### Competitive oligopoly

A competitive oligopoly is when oligopolies compete to try and gain market share.

#### Kinked demand curve

![[Kinked Demand Curve]]


- If a firm raises their price and another firm maintains price, then the former loses revenue
- If a firm lowers their price, other firms will follow. This will lead to a ‘price war’. Revenue falls for all firms
- Price are ‘sticky’ at P1

#### Implications for kinked demand curve

- Kinked demand curves help explain why prices are sticky, so firms return to ‘non-price competition’. This leads to better customer service, promotions/offers, and a user friendly interfaces.
- It can also explain why large amounts are spent on advertising and marketing, and demonstrates *interdependence* - why change the price and risk losing your market share?
- However, in the real world, prices do change - price wars are common in the supermarket industry
- Firms may sacrifice profit for sales in the short term
- Brand loyalty may be strong enough to allow for price rises, for example, Apple.

### Collusive oligopoly

#### Collusion can fail due to…

- Falling market demand - gives firms an incentive to lower price
- The successful entry of non-cartel firms into the industry
- The exposure of illegal price-fixing by market regulators
