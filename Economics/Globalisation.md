# Globalisation
</br>

> [!note] Globalisation
> The process by which businesses or other organizations develop international influence or start operating on an international scale.

### Characteristics of Globalisation

- Expanding trade in goods and services
- Capital flows across boarders (FDI - Foreign Direct Investment)
- Labour migration
- Global rules and standards
- Global institutions, e.g. World Bank, IMF
</br>

### Costs and Benefits of Globalisation for MDCs

Globalisation can come with costs for MDCs. 

These include:

- Structural unemployment
- Inflationary pressure resulting from shortages
- Over reliance on other nations
- High levels of competition can lead to business failure

However, some argue that the developed world benefits more from globalisation and trade - this is called the ‘dependency theory of trade and development’

Benefits include:

- Access to cheaper products from abroad
- Greater export market
- Production is outsourced (less environmental damage)

### The role of MNCs in Globalisation

- MNCs are business enterprises operating in several countries to manage production or to deliver goods and services
