Characteristics of Monopolistically Competitive Markets ^MjriF9tG

A monopolistically competitive market has imperfect competition. Firms are short-run profit maximisers.

Firms sell non-homogenous products due to branding. However, there are a lot of relatively close
substitutes. This makes XED high.

The model is based on the assumption that there are a large number of buyers and sellers, which are
relatively small and act independently. Each seller has the same degree of market power as other
sellers, but their market power is relatively weak.

Firms in a monopolistically competitive market compete using non-price competition. There are no barriers
to entry or exit from the market.

Since firms have a downward sloping demand curve, they can raise their price without losing all of their
customers. This is because firms have some degree of price-setting power. 

Buyers and sellers in a monopolistically competitive market have imperfect information. ^r3UYHpqt
