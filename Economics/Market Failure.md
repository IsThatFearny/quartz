# Market Failure

</br>

A market fails when the price mechanism fails to allocate scarce resources efficiently and society suffers as a result. Market failure occurs when signalling, incentive and the rationing functions fail to operate optimally, which leads to a loss of welfare. 

#### Complete Market Failure

- No market exists - 'missing market'
- E.g. public goods

#### Partial Market Failure

- A market functions but either the price or the quantity is wrong

</br>

## Public goods, private good and quasi public goods
</br>

### Private Goods

- Where consumption by one person results in the good not being available for consumption by another
- Excludable - the owner has property rights
- Rival - One person's consumption reduces availability
</br>

### Public Goods

- A good or service one where it is impossible to prevent people form receiving the benefits of the good once it has been provided.
- They are not normally provided by the private sector because they would be unable to supply them for a profit
- Non-excludable - The benefits cannot be confined solely to those who have paid for it
- Non-rival consumption - One party's enjoyment does not diminish another's.

#### Free riders 

- With public goods, there is little incentive to pay for the consumption of the good. A free rider is someone who receives the benefit but allows others to pay for it
- The price mechanism cannot work if there are free riders
- Consumers won't choose to pay for a public good that they can get for free because other consumers have paid for it
- It is also difficult to set a price for a public good because it may be difficult to work out their value for customers
- Producers may overvalue the benefits to increase the price

</br>

### Quasi-Public Goods

- A good which is not full non-rival and/or where it is possible to exclude people from consuming it
- E.g. Motorways and major roads, police force protection
- There is a strong case for the government to provide both public and quasi-public goods
</br>

### Public Goods and Technological Change

Technological change can enable a public good to become a quasi-public good as it an change some of its characteristics to that of a private good.

</br>

## Externalities

- These occur when the production or consumption of a good or service has an effect on a third party.
- Market failure occurs when externalities are ignored.
</br>

### Marginal Private Benefits - the demand curve

- The demand curve is also known as the marginal benefit curve
- It shows the utility or benefit that the consumption of a good 

![[Marginal Private Benefit Demand Curve]]

</br>

### Marginal Private Costs - the supply curve

- The supply curve reflects the firm's costs of production
- Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit of the good

![[Marginal Private Cost Supply Curve]]

</br>

### Social Costs

- The true cost of consumption or production that is the sum of the private and external costs
- Private costs + external costs = social costs
</br>

### Social Benefits

- The true benefit of consumption or production that is the total sum of the private and external costs
- Private benefits + external benefits = social benefits

</br>

- If there are no externalities (no side effects) the intersection of the MPB curve and the MPC curve determines an equilibrium price and quantity that reflects a social optimum
- If no externalities exist, MSB = MSC


![[No Externalities Diagram]]


- If externalities exist, then:
	- A production externality creates a divergence between MPC and MSC
	- A consumption externality creates a divergence between MPB and MSB

</br>

### Negative Externalities

- These occur when production/consumption impose external costs on third parties outside of the market for which no appropriate compensation is paid
- Spillover effects of economic activity
- Ignoring negative production externalities leads to overproduction
- Negative externalities exist when there is a divergence between private costs and social costs


![[Negative Externalities]]

</br>

### Positive Externalities

- These occur when a third party benefits arising from the production or consumption of goods and services
- In other words, they occur when the social benefit is greater than the private benefit

![[Positive Externalities]]

</br>

### Negative Consumption Externalities

- Ignoring negative consumption externalities leads to over consumption
- E.g. Individuals will ignore the externalities associated with eating fast food/too much food
- This will result in the consumption of a good being higher than the socially optimal level, causing a welfare loss to society

</br>

## Merit Goods

Consumption of merit goods is believed to generate positive externalities - where the social benefit from consumption exceeds the private benefit, e.g. health programmes. 

- They will be under-consumed if left to free market sources
- This may be due to imperfect information
- They are provided by the state and private sector
- They can be rival, excludable, and rejectable


![[Market Failure Merit Goods]]
</br>


## Demerit Goods

Demerit goods deliver a lower benefit to the consumer than they realise at the time of consumption

- They are over-consumed in the free market leading to a misallocation of resources - imperfect information
- Consumers unaware of negative externalities
- May lead to government intervention
- Social cost of consumption is greater than the private cost

</br>

## Market Imperfections

</br>

### Imperfect Information

The price mechanism will only allocate resources efficiently if consumers/producers enjoy perfect information. Utility will only be maximised if behaviour is rational and hold correct information on which to base their decisions.

### Symmetric Information

The buyer and the seller have the same information.

### Asymmetric Information

Either the buyer or seller possess more information than the other party. This leads to a situation of imperfect information.
</br>

### Factor Immobility

This occurs when it is difficult for factors of production (e.g. labour and capital) to move between different areas of the economy. Immobile factors of production mean there is an inefficient use of resources - they are unused or underused. This is the cause of the market failure.

#### Labour Immobility

Labour immobility means that labour does not ‘move’ to where it is in greatest demand.

##### Geographical Immobility

Where workers find it difficult to move where employment opportunities are.

##### Occupational Immobility

As patterns of demand and employment change, workers may find it difficult to secure jobs as they lack the necessary skills.
