# The Distribution of Income and Wealth in the UK

Markets cannot ensure that everyone will secure enough income to satisfy their basic needs. Governments around the world use a variety of methods to change the distribution of income and arrive at a more socially desirable outcome.

Issues:

- Excessive inequality is both a cause and a consequence of market failure
- It is influenced by value judgements
- What is a fair distribution of income and wealth?

## Income: A flow of money to the factors of production

### Which factors affect the distribution of income?

- Land - Rent
- Labour - Wages
- Capital - Interest
- Enterprise - Profit
- Region in which you live
- Education - ‘human capital’
- Skills/experience
- Age structure

## Wealth: The current value of a stock of assets

Wealth is a stock of assets that an individual has at any particular time, this can be assets in the form of money, pension, shares or property. The ONS split wealth into four main categories:
- Property wealth - any property privately owned in the UK or abroad
- Physical wealth - value of physical assets, e.g. paintings, cars, etc.
- Financial wealth - net financial wealth is calculated by subtracting from financial asset values the value of any financial liabilities
- Private pension wealth the value of private pension schemes in which individuals can receive income either now or in the future

## Measuring Inequality

### Lorenz Curve

The Lorenz curve shows the extent of inequality. It is used to graphically represent the distribution of income. The inequality in a country can be measured by the relative share of income earned by a given percentage of the population.

### Gini Coefficient

A statistical tool that measures income or wealth inequality calculating a numerical value of a country’s Lorenz curve. The Gini Coefficient is calculated by the ratio of the area under the curve to the area under the 45 degree line, as below:
