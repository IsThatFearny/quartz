# Contestable Markets

</br>

- A contestable market is a market where there is the potential for or threat of competition
- This puts pressure on existing firms to behave more efficiently

</br>

### Assumptions of contestable markets

The assumptions of a contestable market include:

- Freedom of entry and exit
- Number of competing firms varies
- Firms compete (rather than collude)

</br>

### What makes a market more contestable?

A market will be more contestable if:
- Profits are high - so there is an incentive to enter
- Barriers to entry and exit are low - encourages hit and run competition
- Sunk costs are low - so any initial investment can be recovered easily
- Technology is shared and not subject to patents - level playing field for all firms
- Low degree of brand loyalty for existing firms - easier for new firms to gain a foothold
- Products can be easily differentiated - new firms can stand out and offer something different to consumers

### Outcomes

#### Short Run

- Existing firms will attempt to reduce the incentive for new firms to join by using ‘limit pricing’
- This means sacrificing some supernormal profit (or all if pricing where AR=AC)
- Profits will fall and consumer surplus will rise

#### Long Run

- Depends on how conditions in the market change
- If the market becomes more contestable, then normal profit will become the long run equilibrium
- If the market becomes less contestable then it is possible that existing firms may be able to increase price and return to making abnormal profit
