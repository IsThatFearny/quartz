# MRP Theory

</br>





The demand for labour is derived from:

1) **Marginal physical product (MPP)**: the addition to output when one more worker is added
2) **Marginal revenue (MR)**: the price of the product.

$$MPP \times MR = Marginal \ Revenue \ Product$$

#### Example

In this example, if the going rate for hiring another member of staff is £60 per day, Chris should employ five workers. The MC curve is a horizontal line drawn from £60 on the Y-axis to its intersection on the MRP curve. When this is cross-referenced with the X-Axis, it shows that 5 workers should be hired in order to maximise profit for the business. Hiring 6 workers would mean that the firm loses money, because the productivity of the 6th worker is so low that the money that they bring in is lower than the burden that they place on their employer.

### Demand curve for Labour

The demand curve for labour shows how many workers will be hired at any given wage rate over a period of time. The curve is downward sloping in the short run because of the law of diminishing returns, and in the long run because of the availability of capital.





The demand for labour is influenced by:

1) Productivity of labour - a rise in productivity in a specific labour market will shift the MRP curve outwards
2) Demand for the product - a rise in the price of the product will increase MR and shift the MRP curve outwards
3) Substitutability of capital - if capital becomes more advanced or the price of capital falls, this will reduce demand for labour and shift the MRP curve inwards

</br>

### Elasticity of demand for labour

Elasticity of demand for labour measures the responsiveness of labour demand to a change in the wage rate. In some labour markets, workers are easily replaced so firms are more responsive when wages rise, e.g. supermarket check-out workers vs Premier League footballers.





</br>

### Supply of Labour

Labour supply is the number of hours people are willing and able to supply at a given wage rate. It is upward sloping because people are prepared to work more hours when the pay is higher. An increase in the wage rate will lead to an extension along the Labour supply curve. W0 represents the minimum wage a worker will accept (also called the ‘reservation’).





</br>

### Factors that affect supply of labour

- An increase in extra pay
- A decrease in wages in a substitute industry
- A fall in the barriers to gaining employment in an industry
- An improvement in the non-pecuniary benefits of a job
- A rise in net migration into the country





</br>

### Perfectly competitive Labour markets

**Assumptions:**
- Labour is homogenous
- There is perfect information
- There are no barriers to entry or exit
- There are many workers and firms
- All parties are wage-takers





</br>

### Imperfectly competitive labour markets

An imperfectly competitive labour market is one where either:
1) There are many firms but only one supplier of labour (e.g. a trade union)
2) There are many suppliers (workers) but only one buyer (e.g. a monopsony)
3) There is only one buyer and one supplier of labour (e.g. a bilateral monopoly)





</br>

#### A monopoly supplier of labour (trade union)

- A trade union is an organisation of workers who combine together to further their own interests.
- By joining together workers can appoint representatives to bargain on their behalf - this is called “collective bargaining”.
- This is stronger and more effective than each worker negotiating on their own.





![[Trade Union Diagram|250x250]]

- Before the trade union, wages and employment are in
  equilibrium at W1Q1
- The union negotiates a wage floor of W2 which is now the minimum wage in the industry
- This makes the supply curve perfectly elastic up to Q3. If employers want to hire more workers, wages need to be risen above W2
</br>

#### A monopoly buyer of labour (monopsony)

- If a firm is a sole buyer of labour it is called a a monopsonist, e.g. the government employs 90% of its teachers so it is essentially a monopsonist
- A monopsonist is able to exploit its market power and force down wages as its the only employer
- As the only buyer of a certain type of labour, in order to increase production it needs to get workers in other industries to come and work for it - it does this by offering higher wages





</br>

#### Bi-lateral Monopoly (One buyer, one seller)

- Many trade unions operate where there is a sole buyer of labour - this is called a bi-lateral monopoly
- UNISON is the largest trade union in the UK with 1.4 million members and represents many public sector workers
- The impact of a trade union here is to redress the balance of power in the industry and lead to a more efficient level of employment and wage rate
