# Trade
</br>
A feature of globalisation is that nations tend to specialise in the production of the goods and services in which they are relatively low cost producers. Increased trade and specialisation may benefit some groups within a country whilst harming others, for example, those producing goods that compete with imports. 

### Absolute Advantage

Specialisation means that costs are reduced and global output is increased, helping to raise living standards.

Through specialisation, more output is produced using the same amount of resources - cost per unit is reduced. It gives a country a competitive edge.

According to the theory of absolute advantage if countries specialise in and export the good in which they can produce with fewer resources the result is increased production and consumption.

### Comparative Advantage

A country has a comparative advantage if the opportunity cost of it producing a specific good is lower than the opportunity cost for other countries (a country gives up fewer resources than other nations in order to produce the good or service).

#### Comparative advantage graphs

The country with the shallower curve has a comparative advantage with the product on the x axis. The country with the steeper curve has a comparative advantage in product on the y axis.

#### Sources of comparative advantage

- Factor endowment and quality of factors of production
- Levels of technology
- Investment in R&D



#### Limitations

- Comparative advantage is not fixed and can change over time
- The theory assumes that there are no barriers to trade - does not take into account the impact of protectionism

### The advantages of trade

International trade brings a number of valuable benefits to a country, including:

- ﻿﻿﻿The exploitation of a country's comparative advantage, which means that trade encourages a country to specialise in producing only those goods and services which it can produce more effectively and efficiently, and at the lowest opportunity cost.
- Producing a narrow range of goods and services for the domestic and export market means that a country can produce in at higher volumes, which provides further cost benefits in terms of economies of scale.
- Trade increases competition and lowers world prices, which provides benefits to consumers by raising the purchasing power of their own income, and leads a rise in consumer surplus.
- Trade also breaks down domestic monopolies, which face competition from more efficient foreign firms.
- The quality of goods and services is likely to increases as competition encourages innovation, design and the application of new technologies. Trade will also encourage the transfer of technology between countries.
- Trade is also likely to increase employment, given that employment is closely related to production. Trade means that more will be employed in the export sector and, through the multiplier process, more jobs will be created across the whole economy.

### The disadvantages of trade

Despite the benefits, trade can also bring some disadvantages, including:

- Trade can lead to over-specialisation, with workers at risk of losing their jobs should world demand fall or when goods for domestic consumption can be produced more cheaply abroad. Jobs lost through such changes cause severe structural unemployment. The recent credit crunch has exposed the inherent dangers in over-specialisation for the UK, with its reliance on its financial services sector.
- Certain industries do not get a chance to grow because they face competition from more established foreign firms, such as new infant industries which may find it difficult to establish themselves.
- ﻿﻿﻿Trade can lead to environmental degradation.
- Trade can lead to nation states losing sovereignty-by signing trade agreements a country will have to follow rules that may have a negative impact on their economy.
