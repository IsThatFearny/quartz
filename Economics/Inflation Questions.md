# Inflation Questions

</br>

### 1) Explain how inflation is calculated

Inflation is measured by the annual percentage change in consumer prices. This is gauged using a 'basket of common goods', which is a collection of commonly consumed goods in the UK. This is known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). It covers over 40,000 households, and collects 120,000 separate price quotations of around 600 products.
</br>

### What are the main problems with the CPI as a measure of inflation?

- Not fully representative, inaccurate for an atypical household
- Spending patterns vary from person to person
- Does not take into account reasons for rising/falling prices. A higher price could be the result of an increase in product quality for example.
- The CPI is slow to respond to new products entering the market, very little change in the basket of goods from year to year
</br>

### Explain the difference between inflation, deflation, and disinflation

- Inflation: A sustained rise in price level and/or cost of living across the economy
- Deflation: A sustained fall in price level and/or cost of living across the economy
- Disinflation: A decrease in the rate of inflation (still positive, but moving more slowly)

</br>

### Identify any periods of disinflation on the chart on page 2

- 2017 - inflation rate decreased and plateaued
- Any small spikes downwards are evidence of disinflation

</br>

### Explain why cost-push inflation is seen as worse than demand-pull inflation

Demand-pull inflation has benefits to the economy, such as GDP growth (although this is unsustainable) and a positive output gap. It is caused by excess aggregate demand.

However, cost-push inflation has no such benefits, and causes rising import and raw material prices, as it is caused by a shift inwards in supply. This can raise unemployment.

</br>

### Explain why governments want a low and stable rate of inflation

Inflation is hard to remove from an economy once it sets in, and will reduce standards of living, raise the cost of living, decrease real wages, and reduce the stability of the national currency. In addition, higher inflation causes reduced confidence in the economy, reducing aggregate supply and demand, and reduces purchasing power and the value of savings
</br>

### Research the latest additions to the CPI basket of goods and services. What goods have been removed?

19 items have been added. These include: meat-free sausages, canned pulses, sports bras, pet collars, and antibacterial wipes. This is due to rises in consumption in these things.

Removals include men's suits, coal, and doughnuts. These products have seen a significant fall in consumption and are no longer representative of average consumption.
