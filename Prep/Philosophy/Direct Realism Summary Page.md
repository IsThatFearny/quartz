# Direct Realism Summary Page

</br>

Direct realism is a theory of perception which states that what we see is what truly exists, and that our perception is empirical evidence for the existence of mind-independent physical objects. If I see a brown table in a room, then a Direct Realist would argue that the table, as I see it, truly does exist.

However, there are numerous counter-arguments to Direct Realism, the most common one being the argument from perceptual variation. Russel presents this argument neatly, using the brown table as his example. Say that there is a brown table in a room. From one perspective, this table may appear brown, but with spots of light from overhead lights reflecting upon it. From another perspective, these spots of light may be in a different place, or indeed not present at all. The argument, therefore, asks how can we really know that the table is brown, or indeed a table at all, when our perception of it differs under different circumstances? Another issue that plagues Direct Realism is the argument from hallucination. This argument simply asks 'how can we know that what we are perceiving is not a dream or a hallucination?'. It argues that there is no way to tell dreams and hallucinations apart from objective reality, and therefore the statement that 'what we see is what exists' must be doubted under these circumstances. Yet another argument against direct realism is that from illusion. In a very similar vein to hallucination, the argument asks 'how can we be sure that our senses are correct, and are not being manipulated by something or changed by another party?'. The answer to this is we cannot, and therefore Direct Realism is rendered invalid. In addition to this, a final issue that faces Direct Realism is time-lag. We know that, when we touch something, there is a slight delay in us touching it and registering that sensation. Therefore, this argument says, we are not *directly* perceiving it, as it is not immediate and instantaneous (Indirect Realism responds to this by proposing sense-data as a medium through which we perceive)  

Direct Realism, whilst a very simple and easy to understand theory of perception, fails to respond satisfactorily to these counter-arguments, and therefore we may look for another theory of perception that addresses these key issues.
