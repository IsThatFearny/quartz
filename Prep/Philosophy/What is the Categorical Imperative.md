# What is the Categorial Imperative?

</br>

### Explain the (first) formulation of the categorical imperative?

Kant says that you should 'act only on that maxim through which at the same time will that it should become a universal law'. This is the categorical imperative. Kant rephrases this as 'to have a good will, I should act only on maxims that I can also will everyone to act on'.

### How does the first formulation of the categorical imperative serve as a motive or criterion for the good will?

The 'good will' relies upon the categorical imperative (it is necessary to the good will). It does not specify any end goal, arguing that you should be motivated to do something simply because it is considered to be 'right'

### Explain the difference between a hypothetical and a categorical imperative (Illustrate your answer with examples)

A hypothetical imperative is a statement about what you ought to do, assuming that there is some sort of end goal. For example, 'if you want to see the show, you ought to get to the theatre at least 15 minutes early'. This makes it a conditional statement, and the command 'get to the theatre at least 15 minutes early' is the condition. Kant argues that willing the end entails willing the means (this is an analytic truth). This is separate from a categorical imperative, in that a categorical imperative has no goal/end, whereas a hypothetical imperative does.

### Kant argues that there are two ways in which we could fail to be able to will our maxim to become a universal law: contradiction in conception and contradiction in will. Outline the difference between the two types of contradiction or 'test'

Contradiction in conception is the situation in which everyone that acts on a certain maxim is self-contradictory. Let us say that you act upon the maxim 'I can steal something that I want'. You cannot will for everyone to act upon this maxim, because if everyone stole things, the concept of stealing would be obsolete (to steal from someone they must own the stolen thing, and if everyone steals, ownership ceases to exist; therefore you cannot steal anything). This contradicts itself.

Contradiction in will means that, while the maxim is not self-contradictory when universalised, we still cannot rationally will it. We cannot will a situation in which it is impossible to achieve our ends (this contradicts the very act of willing), and it is possible that the only available means to an end is to do something which we do not want to do. We cannot therefore will that this possibility is denied to us, and we cannot therefore will this situation.

### Explain the relation between morality and reason in Kant's Deontology

Kant argues that not only is it morally wrong to disobey the categorical imperative, but it is also irrational. Reason determines our duties and gives us motivation to perform them. In addition, it is intuitive to say that morality applies to all and only rational beings. A protest against moral injustice usually makes sense to reason, and with this link we can explain the nature of morality in terms of reason. Morality is universal, and so is reason. Neither is dependent upon our wants.

### What is the second formulation of the categorical imperative?

Kant puts this as 'act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end'. By this, he means that people are ends in themselves, and we must therefore always treat them as such, not as only a means to an end. While we can rely on them as a means, we must always respect them as an end as well. To treat someone as a means undermines their ability to make a rational choice.

### On what grounds does Kant argue that humans have intrinsic moral worth?

Kant argues that humans have intrinsic moral worth on the grounds that we have rational will (dignity). The will gives value (unconditionally) to everything else. By 'humanity', Kant means our ability to rationally determine which ends to adopt and pursue.

### Explain Kant's claim that we must treat humans as ends in themselves

Kant claims that someone being an end in themselves means that they are also an end for others, and that we should adopt their ends as our own. The second formulation requires that we help other people, and claims that this is one of our ends in life.
