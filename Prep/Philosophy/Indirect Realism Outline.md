# Indirect Realism Outline
</br>

Indirect realism is a response to the issues that plague direct realism, stating that we perceive the external world indirectly through 'sense-data'. Sense-data is what our senses perceive, and this varies depending upon the agent's circumstances (aka perceptual variation). Sense data is private, and is completely subjective to the individual. Indirect Realism claims that any object that we see is merely a representation of the object in the external world. In addition to this, John Locke stated that any mind-independent physical object has two sets of qualities: primary and secondary. Primary qualities are those which persist despite any changes that the object goes through (an example of this is shape); secondary qualities are those that change as the object or the agent's circumstances change (examples of these include colour and temperature). This allows us to know things (albeit only primary qualities) about the properties of an object.
