# Further issues with Substance Dualism


### What is epiphenomenalist substance dualism?

Epiphenomenalist substance dualism is the claim that the mind has no causal powers, which eliminates the question of how the mind can cause events. Further, mental events cannot cause other mental events.
</br>

### Explain the claim that epiphenomenalism doesn’t accord with our experiences.

It is argued that Epiphenomenalism doesn’t accord with experience, as we surely experience causal connections between our mental states, and between our mental states and our behaviour. When I feel pain, I might jump around shouting, so surely there must be a link. In a similar vein, when I say what I think, my thought must be the cause of what I say. Epiphenomenalism argues that my experience is completely misleading, because there cannot be causal connections.

</br>

### Explain the claim that epiphenomenalism makes it hard to understand how I can know my own mental states.

Epiphenomenalism would have it that we do not know of our own mental states. For example, How do I know that I am in pain? Clearly the answer to this is introspection, but Epiphenomenalism holds that pain doesn’t cause anything, nor does the belief that I am in pain. If my thoughts and feelings do not cause my beliefs, then I could hold those beliefs no matter my mental states, as long as their causes operate in the same way. This causes us to conclude that my beliefs about my mind are unreliable and unjustifiable, and therefore I cannot know my own mind.
</br>

### What is the problem of other minds? And what challenge does this raise for substance dualism?

Epiphenomenalism raises the question of solipsism. We each experience our own minds from ‘within’ and can apprehend our sensations and emotions in a way that is ‘felt’. However, we cannot experience the mental states of others, and all we have to go on is our understanding of their behaviour. Thus, if mind and body are independent, as substance dualism argues, how can I infer from seeing a body that there is a mind attached to it? Other people could all be machines, with no minds. We have no way of telling otherwise.
</br>

### Outline the argument for other minds from analogy and explain why its use of induction is problematic.

P1: I have a mind
P2: I know from experience that my mental states cause my behaviour
P3: Other people have bodies similar to mine and behave similarly to me in similar situations
C1: Therefore, by analogy, their behaviour has the same type of cause as my behaviour, namely mental states
C2: Therefore, other people have minds

This is regarded as the ‘common-sense’ position on solipsism. However, it uses induction incorrectly. It bases its rejection of solipsism on a single case, that of my own mind. You cannot make a generalisation from a singular case, and therefore we cannot conclude that other minds exist.
</br>

### Explain how we might reformulate this argument and the objections this alternative faces.

The reformulation of this argument cites many instances of behaviour which we know to have a mental cause:

P1: This behaviour has a mental cause
P2: That behaviour has a mental cause
P3: That third behaviour has a mental cause
P4: Etc.
C1: Therefore, many behaviours have a mental cause
P5: Other people exhibit these behaviours
C2: Those behaviours also have mental causes
C3: Therefore, other people have minds

However, we can object that not all behaviours that I experience have mental causes, and I may not be aware of a mental cause. C1 is therefore not strong enough to support C2. We can also object that the argument relies on the controversial claim that similar effects have similar causes, but it is possible for similar effects to have different causes. This could be the case for other people’s behaviour.
</br>

### Explain the argument that the existence of other minds is the best hypothesis, including developments of this argument.

Philosophers analyse mental states as the ‘inner’ states of an organism that respond to the environment and cause behaviour. These mental states have a function, for example pain prevents further damage to the body by causing a quick response. This is said to be the best explanation of behaviour. This enables a substance dualist to then argue that ‘inner’ states are states of a distinct mental substance.

</br>

### Outline three objections to the best hypothesis argument for other minds.

1) The argument depends on functionalism being the correct account of mental states
2) We must solve the problem of how the mind can cause physical events
3) We can object that the rejection of solipsism is not a hypothesis, nor do we infer that people have minds empirically

</br>

### Why do some readers claim that Descartes also argues for the existence of other minds by analogy?

Descartes says “if I look out of a
window and see men crossing the square … I say that I see the men themselves … Yet do I see more than hats and coats which could conceal robots? I judge that they are men.” This can be interpreted as us inferring that these people are men.
</br>

### How does Avramides challenge this claim?

Avramedes argues that the argument from analogy uses two separate observations and two separate judgements. However, in this case, Descartes only proposes a singular judgement.

Avramedes also argues that Descartes is not discussing the problem of solipsism, but is instead writing on the relation between perception and judgement. Therefore, the idea that he has a mind is not a premise in his argument.
