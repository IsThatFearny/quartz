# Meta-Ethics
</br>

### How does metaethics differ from normative ethics?

Whilst normative ethics discusses which normative principle we should adopt (pleasure? duty? virtue?) in making moral decisions about how to live, metaethics asks ‘what is morality?’.

### Summarise the questions posed by metaethics in a) philosophy of language; b) philosophy of mind; c) metaphysics; and d) epistemology

(N.B. questions 2, 3 and 4 enlarge on what the metaethical question ‘what is morality?’ involves)

#### a) Philosophy of language

What is the meaning of statements such as ‘killing is wrong’, ‘courage is good’, etc.? Are they statements of fact (do they have ‘truth value’ can they be true or false)? Or, are they statements (expressions) of approval/disapproval of actions or character traits

#### b) Philosophy of mind

What is involved in holding one particular moral view rather than another? That is to say, is ‘killing is wrong’ a factual statement and so a belief, or does it display an emotional attitude towards the act of killing - an expression of approval or disapproval? Or a motivation?

#### c) Metaphysics

If moral statements state truths (if they have truth value) are these truths objective? Are they moral properties of reality/the external world beyond the mind?

#### d) Epistemology

If there are moral truths then how do we discover them? If not - and they are expressions of subjective feeling - is there such a thing as moral reasoning? How are our moral claims to be justified? How do we ‘argue’ about them?

### Explain what it means to claim that moral principles originate a) in reason; b) in emotions/attitudes; and c) in society

Moral statements originate:

- In reason
	- Moral realism: The origin of moral principles re similar to the origin of scientific beliefs (empirical approach) or similar to the origin of mathematical statements (rationalist approach)
- In emotions/attitudes
	- Non-cognitivists argue that moral statements don’t have truth value. Instead they are subjective feelings/attitudes of approval about how we feel ourselves and others should act
- In society
	- Moral relativism (‘cultural relativism’). Moral principles are inter-subjective: morality arises out of due need to regulate/organise social relations

### What is the difference between cognitivism and non-cognitivism?

Cognitivists argue that moral statements are beliefs, which non-cognitivists argue that moral statements are mental states based on attitudes or feelings (emotions). 

### Explain the difference between cognitive and non-cognitive mental states in terms of the ‘direction of fit’

### What are the principle challenges facing a) cognitivism and b) non-cognitivism?

## From cognitivism to moral realism

### Outline three arguments for moral realism


1) We can make mistakes about morality. Children often do, and they have to be taught what is right and wrong
2) Morality feels like an ‘external’ demand. We feel answerable to a standard of behaviour which is independent of what we want or feel.
3) Many people believe in moral progress. But how is moral progress possible, unless some views about morality are better than others? And how can this be possible unless there are facts about morality?

### What is moral realism?

[[Philosophy/Glossary#Moral realism|Moral realism]] claims that good and bad are properties of situations and people, and right and wrong are properties of actions. These properties are genuine parts of the world. Whether moral judgements are true or false depends on the way that the word is and on what properties an action, person or situation actually has.

###  What is moral naturalism, with reference to the nature of non-reductive moral naturalism?

[[Philosophy/Glossary#Moral naturalism|Moral naturalism]] is the claim that moral properties are natural properties. There are two types of this: reductive and non-reductive. G.E. Moore gives the definition of natural properties as ‘properties that we can identify through sense experience and science’. This is the reductive form of moral naturalism, in which we ‘reduce’ moral properties to other forms, such as psychological properties (e.g. happiness). Non-reductive moral naturalism argues that morality is an expression of the natural capacities of human beings, the capacities we have as a species of animal, which are a part of our nature. This rejects ‘supernatural’ forms of morality (such as morality being determined by god).

### Explain Utilitarianism as a form of reductive moral naturalism

The utilitarian claim that ‘the only good is happiness’ can be interpreted as a reductive claim. Happiness and goodness can therefore be equated. Happiness is a natural property, and therefore so is goodness. As happiness is a natural property, the maximisation of happiness is also a natural property. According to Utilitarianism, ‘rightness’ is also a natural property, and thus Utilitarianism can be interpreted as a form of reductive moral naturalism.

### Explain the difference between reductive moral naturalism and non-reductive Aristotelian naturalism

Aristotelian virtue ethics is a form of non-reductive moral naturalism, because morality is based on natural facts about human nature. We can identify flourishing in any species by using biology, ethology and psychology, and so these can help us identify what eudaimonia involves for us. Further to this, it is a natural fact that human beings are rational animals. However, virtue ethics cannot be *reduced* to claims about natural facts, as the rationality involved in practical wisdom is not just a matter of knowing and applying facts that we can discover through sense-experience and science.

### What is moral non-naturalism?

[[Philosophy/Glossary#Moral non-naturalism|Moral non-naturalism]] is the claim that moral properties are not natural properties (this is in the sense that a natural property is ‘a property that we can discover through sense experience and the sciences’)

### What is the ‘naturalistic fallacy’ (with reference to the correlation/identity distinction)?

The naturalistic fallacy is any attempt to identify goodness with a natural property. Moral properties may be *correlated* with natural properties, but it is essential to note that correlation is not identity. So, even if goodness is correlated with happiness or pleasure, this does not mean that they are the same property. Because goodness is not a natural property, and can’t therefore be analysed in terms of any other property, it would be a mistake to think that the property of goodness is identical with any natural property.

### Explain Moore’s ‘open question’ argument

Moore uses this argument to support his view that a definition of goodness is impossible. An open question is a question to which the answer is variable, e.g. yes or no. If goodness is pleasure, then it wouldn’t make sense to ask ‘is pleasure good?’ - this would be equivalent to asking ‘is pleasure pleasure?’. The answer has to be yes, and cannot logically be no, and so the question is a closed question. However, Moore says that the question ‘is pleasure good?’ is not a closed question, because it is possible for the answer to be either yes or no. Goodness, therefore, cannot be pleasure, nor any other property, as asking whether $x$ is good is always an open question.

### Is the naturalistic fallacy a genuine fallacy?

If we were to portray the argument differently, as below, then it becomes clear that Moore’s open question argument doesn’t work.

```ad-note
title: The failing of the naturalistic fallacy

The property of 'being water' cannot be any other property in the world, such as the property of being H<sub>2</sub>0. If it was, then the question 'Is water H<sub>2</sub>0?' would not make sense - alike to asking 'is H<sub>2</sub>0 H<sub>2</sub>0?'. Thus, water is a simple, unanalysable property. This cannot be right, as water *just is* H<sub>2</sub>0.
```

This argument confuses concepts and properties. The two different concepts - ‘water’ and ‘H<sub>2</sub>0’ - can pick out the same property in the world. People knew about water long before the discovery of hydrogen and oxygen. They had this concept, but not the concept of H<sub>2</sub>0. However, the two concepts relate to the same thing in the world, and therefore water is identical to H<sub>2</sub>0. 

In a similar way, the concept of ‘goodness’ is a different concept from ‘happiness’, but the two concepts may refer to the same property in the world, and so goodness is happiness. Moore’s open question argument fails to show that these are different properties.

### What is [[Philosophy/Glossary#intuitionism|intuitionism]]?

All that Moore thinks we can do is to prove a claim is to consider the truth of the claim - such as ‘pleasure is good’ - itself. Moore calls these claims ‘intuitions’. These are incapable of proof, he says. They therefore must be some variety of synthetic a priori knowledge. Intuitions are self-evident proposals. Intuitionism, in essence, is simply a form of ethical non-naturalism that claims that some our our moral judgements are synthetic yet self-evident.

### What is Ayer’s ‘[[Philosophy/Glossary#verification principle|verification principle]]’?

The verification principle states that a statement only has meaning if it is either analytic or empirically verifiable. If an [[Philosophy/Glossary#Analytical truth|analytic]] statement is empirically verifiable - that is, if empirical evidence would go towards establishing that the statement is true or false - then it is verifiable. A statement is verifiable as long as we *know* how to prove it - no actual proof is required. Additionally, we don’t need to be able to proof that a claim is empirically verifiable. It is enough that empirical evidence raises or reduces the probability that a statement is true. This principle can be understood as a development of Hume’s Fork.

### Explain Ayer’s objection to moral naturalism and non-naturalism

### What is Hume’s Fork?

There are two types of judgements of reason/cognitive judgements: ‘relations of ideas’ (discovered by thought/reflection - analytic) and ‘matters of fact’ (claims about the external world, established by sense experiences - synthetic).

</br>

### Explain the objection to moral cognitivism based on Hume’s fork

Based on the fork, Hume makes the following criticism of moral cognitivism (and thus moral realism): as there are only two types of  judgements of reason and moral judgements belong to neither of these types, then moral judgements are not judgements of reason (instead they are non-cognitive expressions of feelings/attitudes)

To answer Hume’s criticism, the moral cognitivist/realist has to either reject Hume’s fork (i.e. the claim that there are only two types of judgements of reason) or give examples of moral judgements that are matters of fact/relations of ideas.

Moore takes option 1: he rejects the fork and argues that there is another type of judgement of reason, namely moral intuitions, which are synthetic propositions that are self-evident (and so not empirically verifiable in the normal way).

Mill takes option 2:

### Explain one theory claiming that moral judgements are judgements of reason (as a response to the challenge from Hume’s fork to moral realism)
