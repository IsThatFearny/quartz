# Exam Questions Half Term

### What is the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions? (3 Marks)

A necessary condition is one that must be met for a proposition to be true, as opposed to a sufficient condition, which is one that is 'enough' or 'sufficient' for a proposition to be true, e.g. Being an unmarried man is a necessary condition for being a bachelor, and being a bachelor is a sufficient condition for being an unmarried man

### Explain the claim that knowledge is true belief which is not based on false lemmas (5 Marks)

'No False Lemmas' (known henceforth as 'NFL') is an attempt to work around Gettier cases. It adds a condition to the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, stating that 'S did not infer Q from a false belief (P)'. In the case of Smith and Jones, 'Q' is the proposition that 'the man with ten coins in his pocket will get the job', and 'P' is the proposition that 'Jones will get the job'. Due to P being false, Q therefore cannot be classed as knowledge.

While NFL works as intended in the example above, Zagzebski says that NFL does not solve cases such as Dr Jones and the Virus and Fake Barn County.

### Explain the claim that knowledge is true belief formed by reliable cognitive processes (5 Marks)

This approach to defining knowledge is known as 'reliabilism'. It is an attempt to strengthen justification by defining it as a 'reliable cognitive process' (Henceforth, RCP). A reliable cognitive process is a cognitive process that tends to produce a high proportion of true beliefs, such as vision or hearing. These processes are the same for everyone (objective). Reliabilism has multiple benefits, such as allowing young children and animals to have knowledge, as well as people in the past (unlike infallibilism, which entails that we have very little knowledge, which is often considered to be nihilistic).

However, it can be proven wrong through cases such as Fake Barn County, in which we are reluctant to allow the subject to have knowledge, despite the fact that, under Reliabilism, they should possess it.

### Explain how Gettier challenged the definition of knowledge as Justified True Belief, and how virtue epistemology responds to Gettier counter-examples (12 marks)

Edwin Gettier challenged Justified True Belief through counter-examples. The most commonly used one is the case of Smith and Jones, as follows:

- Smith and Jones are both up for the same job
- The Boss has told Smith that Jones will get the job (P)
- Smith sees that Jones has ten coins in his pocket, and forms the proposition that 'the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket' (Q)
- However, Smith ends up getting the job
- Smith, by coincidence, also has ten coins in his pocket

In this case, Justified True Belief would count Smith's Proposition, Q, as knowledge. However, most would argue that as Smith's proposition is not knowledge, as the formation of Q arose from luck or coincidence. Gettier therefore argues that JTB cannot be the correct definition of knowledge.


Virtue Epistemology responds to Gettier counter-examples such as the one above by redefining knowledge. It states that for a proposition to be counted as knowledge, S must belief that P, and S' belief must arise from an act of intellectual virtue. An act of intellectual virtue is something such as recalling a memory, or vision. In addition to this, the act of intellectual virtue must be accurate, adroit, and apt. In the case of Smith and Jones, Virtue epistemology says that Smith's proposition that 'the man with ten coins in his pocket' would not count at all, as the belief did not arise from an act of intellectual virtue that was apt or adroit (despite being accurate). it avoids Gettier cases altogether in this way.
