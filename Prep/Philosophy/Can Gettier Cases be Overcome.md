# Can Gettier Cases be Overcome?
</br>


## What is the 'no false lemmas' condition and how does it deal with Gettier's 'Smith and Jones' example?

The 'no false lemmas' condition is the condition that S did not infer P from a false belief. In the Smith and Jones example proposed by Gettier, the proposition that 'Jones will get the job' is a lemma, and from this smith forms the proposition that 'the man with ten coins in his pocket' will get the job. When the condition 'no false lemmas' is used, the inference that Smith has made no longer satisfies the conditions for knowledge.

</br>

## What concern does Zagzebski raise with this condition? Support your answer with an example

Zagzebski raises the concern that there can be gettier cases that satisfy the 'no false lemmas' condition without the person having knowledge. Zagzebski's example is of Dr Jones and her patient. Dr Jones studies the symptoms of and runs tests on her patient, and diagnoses him with having Virus X. No other known virus produces these test results or symptoms, and therefore Dr Jones has belief and justification that her patient has Virus X. Unbeknownst to her however, the symptoms and test results are actually a result of Virus Y. At this point, she would not have knowledge, as the patient does not in fact have Virus X. However, we know that the patient has just contracted Virus X, yet no symptoms or test results show this. This example satisfies all conditions for knowledge, including no false lemmas. P is true, justified, believed, and is not inferred from a false belief. And yet Dr Jones does not have knowledge.

## What assumption does Gettier make about Smith's beliefs, and how might we challenge this assumption?

Gettier assumes that Smith's beliefs are justified. We can challenge this by arguing that, while Smith may have good reason for his beliefs, these are not sufficient for justification. In turn, if his beliefs are not justified, nor are his conclusions that he draws from these

## How would an infallibilist approach to knowledge avoid Gettier cases altogether?
Gettier cases can be argued to arise from the gap between truth and knowledge. infallibilism avoids Gettier cases by bridging this gap, and making it near impossible for justification to exist without certainty or truth
</br>

## What concern/s might we raise with this approach?

It is rare that justification rules out any possible errors. infallibilism also entails that we have very little knowledge


</br>

## Explain the claim that infallibilism commits the fallacy of equivocation?
infallibilism does not seem to contrast between the statements 'I am mistaken' and 'I could be mistaken'. These two statements, however, are certainly distinct.
</br>

## Explain the reliabilist approach to knowledge, with reference to how it deals with the problem of justification and how it attempts to overcome Gettier style counter-examples
Reliabilism claims that S knows P If and Only If:
- P is true
- S believes that P, and
- S's belief is produced by a reliable cognitive process

'Reliable' in this circumstance can be defined as a cognitive process which produces a high percentage of true beliefs, for example perception or memory.

This concept of a 'reliable cognitive process' attempts to solve the jusification issue through strengthening its definition. This strength is a mid-way point between the usual JTB style and infallibilism

Reliabilism attempts to solve Gettier cases by adding the 'reliable cognitive process' condition, in a similar way to infallibilism.

</br>


## What is the primary advantage of reliabilism?
Reliabilism allows young children and animals to have knowledge (unlike infallibilism, which entails that we have very little knowledge even as adults). This is because they use reliable processes to form their true beliefs, and whether they have justification becomes irrelavent
</br>

## How does the reliabilist understand knowledge as 'good'?
Knowledge is understood as a 'natural' good like beauty or strength, as it bestows benefits on the creature which possesses it. However, we cannot be praised for having knowledge.

</br>

## Explain the claim that reliabilism cannot satifactorily respond to all Gettier-style counter examples
The most common case used to exemplify this is 'fake barn county'. Fake barn county is an area in which there are many fake barns (that is, wooden structures made to look like barns, they are in fact only 2D). You drive into this area, unaware of the fact that you are in fake barn county. If you were to look at a 'barn', you would think 'that's a barn'. While this proposition has come about due to a reliable process (vision), it is not knowledge as it is false. However, you look at one barn in particular, think to yourself  'oh look, another barn'. this barn happens to be the only real barn in the area. This belief is true, and it has come about using a reliable process (vision). However, it is not knowledge, for as is similar in other Gettier cases, it is only by luck that this proposition has been formed. It is 'accidentally true'. The previous example of Dr Jones and the virus (proposed by Zagzebski) can also be used here. Therefore reliabilism does not solve all Gettier cases.
</br>



## Explain Zagzebski's argument that no analysis of knowledge that merely adds conditions to true beliefs can escape Gettier cases
Zagzebski says that as long as the third condition (No false lemmas, reliable process, etc.) is independent of truth, we will always be able to construct Gettier examples that show that this definition of knowledge is incorrect. Zagzebski argues that in a 'good' definition of knowledge, we must demonstrate how truth and the third condition are connected, and not just added on to each other. This connection must have something to do with why knowledge is good in a way that true belief is not
