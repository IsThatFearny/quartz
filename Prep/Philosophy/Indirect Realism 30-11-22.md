# Indirect Realism 30-11-22


1) Write an outline paragraph about indirect realism, imagining that this is for use in a 25 mark essay

Indirect realism is a response to the issues that plague direct realism, stating that we perceive the external world indirectly through 'sense-data'. Sense-data is what our senses perceive, and this varies depending upon the agent's circumstances (aka perceptual variation). Sense data is private, and is completely subjective to the individual. Indirect Realism claims that any object that we see is merely a representation of the object in the external world. In response to the objection that indirect realism entails that we know very little about the external world, John Locke stated that any mind-independent physical object has two sets of qualities: primary and secondary. Primary qualities are those which persist despite any changes that the object goes through (an example of this is shape); secondary qualities are those that change as the object or the agent's circumstances change (examples of these include colour and temperature). This allows us to know things (albeit only primary qualities) about the properties of an object.  


2) Read p87-8 of the textbook and explain Locke and Trotter Cockburn's responses to the claim that IR leads to scepticism

Locke and Trotter Cockburn state that we can confirm if our sense-data is accurate (i.e. we are not hallucinating or are not the subject of and illusion) through sense-data from our other senses, by checking whether the sense-data correlates. For example, if I perceive a fire, but wish to confirm whether this fire is present in the external world, I can do this by feeling its heat on my skin. This correspondence between senses allows us to overcome scepticism relatively simply. In addition to this, it is also possible to confirm your sense data with other people's (however this is subject to the argument over whether we can trust that other people truly exist)
