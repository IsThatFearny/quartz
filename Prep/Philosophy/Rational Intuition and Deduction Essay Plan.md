# Rational Intuition and Deduction Essay Plan

## How successful is Descartes in establishing knowledge of synthetic propositions a priori?

Paragraph 1: Descartes’ primary arguments

- Cogito: I can doubt my senses, my memory, and the existence of a physical body (Evil Demon). But doubting in itself is a kind of thinking. Thus, because we can think, we know that we exist as a thinking thing. (Note that Descartes’ has no reason to think that he is not just a brain in a vat). Our existence does not depend on our body (e.g. sense and knowledge aren’t dependent on a body)
- Clear and distinct ideas: An idea is clear when “it is present and accessible to the attentive mind”. An idea is distinct if it is clear and “it is so sharply separated from all other ideas that every part of it is clear”. Rational intuition is the ‘natural light’, i.e. our ability to know that clear and distinct ideas are true. Clear and distinct ideas are indubitable, because when a clear and rational thinker considers a proposition, they judge it to be impossible that it is false
- Succession of thoughts: Perhaps we are only a succession of thoughts, rather than a continuous thing. Descartes’ confuses similarity with identity, i.e. similarity of thoughts with an identical consistent ‘thing’. Descartes responds to this by saying that thoughts logically require a thinker. Hume objects to this, as the thinker may not be the same thinker as Descartes’ thinks
- It is not clear and distinct as to whether I am a mental substance

Paragraph 2: Arguments (Trademark, Cosmological, Ontological)

- God is supremely perfect, so he cannot deceive us, nor would he allow us to be deceived
- Trademark: I have the concept of god, which is of something infinite and perfect. I can create many ideas including of people and physical objects. I am finite, God is infinite. God is therefore a concept of something with more reality than my own mind. Its cause must have equal reality. My mind could not have created the concept. God therefore exists (and is innate). Empiricists respond by saying that perfection and infinity are unclear, and so the concept of God cannot be a clear and distinct idea
- Cosmological: I am not the cause of my existence, because I am not perfect. My existence is not uncaused, and so I depend on something else to exist. I have the concept of God, so whatever causes my existence must be a thinking thing and have the idea of God. What causes me either is caused or caused itself. Infinite regress is impossible so something must have caused its own existence. This is God. Empiricists respond that we can object with 1) not everything may have a cause, and 2) We don’t know that an infinite regress is impossible
- Ontological: The idea of God is innate, and i understand from this that it is god’s nature to always exist. To think that god does not exist is a contradiction in terms, as existing is part of the concept of a supremely perfect being. Empiricists respond that 1) Nothing that we may conceive implies a contradiction. We may conceive of something as both existent and non-existent. 

Paragraph 3: Physical Objects

- Physical objects are extended and changeable. It is clear and distinct, and so physical objects are possible
- There are reasons to think that physical objects exist, but no proof. We have involuntary sense experience of them. But this is not enough
- Because sense experience is involuntary, we know they are not caused by us. If God is not a deceiver, they are not caused by God, but by physical objects. Therefore, physical objects exist
- Empiricists may object that not everything must have a cause and existence of physical objects is bets hypothesis and this is sufficient
