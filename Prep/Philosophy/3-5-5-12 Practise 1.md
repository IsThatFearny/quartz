### What is philosophical scepticism? (3)

Philosophical scepticism is the view that we cannot justify our beliefs, and therefore we cannot claim to have any knowledge. It serves as a challenge to empiricism and rationalism.

### Explain one way in which a direct realist could respond to the argument from illusion (5)

The argument from illusion is the argument that the direct realist must argue that an illusion is, in fact reality (for example, a pencil that looks crooked in water would actually be crooked under direct realism). The direct realist could respond to this criticism by arguing that just because the pencil looks crooked, this does not mean that anything that exists that is actually crooked. Rather, the pencil has the property of looking crooked in water. An illusion simply changes how the object looks, rather than how it is, because the two types of properties are separate. If this argument is taken as true, then direct realism holds, as we can still directly perceive physical objects.

### Explain how Berkeley’s idealism differs from indirect realism (5)

Indirect Realism is the claim that we perceive mind-independent physical objects via mind-dependent sense data. This sense-data is a representation of the external world. Indirect realism argues that physical objects have two types of qualities: primary which are mind-independent, fixed, and constant; and secondary, which are mind-dependent, fleeting, and variable. Berkeley’s idealism differs from indirect realism, because it does not claim that we perceive the external world in this way - rather, it claims that all of our perceptions are entirely mind-dependent. The definition of primary and secondary qualities differs too: secondary qualities remain mind-dependent, but primary qualities are also claimed to be mind-dependent, because they may change depending on perspective (e.g. an object may get bigger as you move closer towards it).

### Outline philosophical scepticism and explain how reliabilism responds to it (12)

Philosophical scepticism is the claim that we cannot justify our beliefs, for we may doubt our justification, and therefore we cannot have knowledge. For example, we have no reason to belief that we are not simply a brain in a vat. If I were a brain in a vat, with all my sensory signals being controlled by an evil scientist, then I would not be able to distinguish the virtual reality that I am living in from actual reality. This deception prevents me from knowing whether I am indeed a brain in a vat. Even if I believe that I am not a brain in a vat, and even if this is a true belief, my belief still lacks justification, and therefore I cannot be said to know that I am not a brain in a vat. This causes major issues for theories of knowledge, as they must find a way to strengthen the justification condition beyond global scepticism.

Reliabilism attempts this. It is the claim we may have knowledge if it is true, we believe that it is true, and it arises from a *reliable cognitive process*. A reliable cognitive process is one that produces a high proportion of true beliefs, such as memory or introspection. By using this definition of justification, the reliabilist argues that the theory is able to overcome philosophical scepticism, because it argues that justified true belief is not subject to global scepticism. If my knowledge that I am not a brain in a vat arises from a reliable cognitive process, such as introspection, then I can say that I am not a brain in a vat.
