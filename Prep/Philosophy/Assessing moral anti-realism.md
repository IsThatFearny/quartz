# Assessing moral anti-realism

</br>

### Explain two objections to emotivism

1) We can object that being emotive and influencing attitudes is something that non-moral language is capable of, e.g. advertising. We must therefore say more to distinguish these
2) Moral language isn’t necessarily emotive. The words ‘good’, ‘right’ and ‘bad’ may arouse emotions in others or express our own, but this depends on context. We do not always think that it is good to arouse emotions in others on moral issues. Sometimes, moral discussion should be dispassionate
</br>

### Are these objections effective?

No: these objections only serve to show that moral language isn’t always emotive, not that it isn’t ‘essentially’ emotive.
</br>

### Explain the objection that moral language is not only prescriptive

Moral language has many functions, aside from prescription. For example, someone may ask what to do. There are lots of other situations in which we can use moral language - we may implore, confess, complain, etc.
</br>

### Explain the objective that non-cognitivist theories cannot explain the multiple uses of moral language

Non-cognitivist theories have to argue that one use of moral language is essential in order to overcome counter-examples. Objections rest on the claim that that moral language has multiple uses. It can be used in many ways, and express different psychological states.
</br>

### Explain the objection that emotivism cannot explain moral reasoning. Is the argument effective?

Emotivism claims that moral judgements and arguments are about influencing people’s attitudes, and this claim means that a good moral argument will be one that is effective. This is the only criterion. If an argument makes someone change their mind, then it is a good argument. But surely this is highly unsatisfactory? The argument is effective, because it overcomes Ayer’s objection (that moral arguments are not arguments over moral judgements, but over facts) by arguing that it is perhaps incorrect to state that there can be disagreement over a moral judgement when it has no truth value, and by claiming that if emotivism is correct, it would seem that thinking about a question is irrational, because according to emotivism you should be able to answer said question by noting your current attitude towards it.
</br>

### How does the prescriptivist account of moral reasoning differ from the emotive account?

Prescriptivism claims that:

1) We can ask about someone’s reasons for prescribing their actions
2) Morality involves consistency - moral judgements must be universalised between things such as the suffering of people and animals.
3) We can infer prescriptions from other prescriptions, e.g. the claim that ‘abortion is wrong’ can be inferred from the statement that ‘taking an innocent human life is wrong’. Thus, our prescriptions are logically linked to each other.

### Can prescriptivism explain moral reasoning?

It can be objected that the only kind of rationality that prescriptivism can recognise in moral argument is consistency. Hare’s theory (in terms of universalisability) bares a relation to Kantian Deontology. However, Hare rejects Kant’s argument that the standards for the good will are set by reason. This means, as long as I am prepared to universalise a claim, there is no objective ground on which to disagree. Thus, prescriptivism cannot explain moral reasoning. 
</br>
### Does moral anti-realism lead to moral nihilism?

Moral anti-realism claims that there are no mind-independent moral properties, no objective moral truths, and non-cognitivist forms claim that morality is an expression of emotions/attitudes. Thus, because we invent moral values, we have no obligation to be moral and no obligations to have certain emotions. So why accept morality at all?

Moral anti-realists argue that this is an unfair simplification or a misunderstanding. Error theory allows for subjective moral values, and all three anti-realist theories argue that living without moral values is itself an expression of feeling. This, therefore, does not mean that we should stop having moral feelings.

The moral nihilist responds that this is unjustifiable. We cannot justify interfering with the behaviour of others. This seems very petty. Whilst the anti-realist may argue that our interference is not due to mere disagreement, but dues to the other person being racist, cowardly, cruel, etc, the previous example of how we cannot disagree with questionable views due to there being no objective grounds on which to do so can be used against this. Thus, we can conclude that moral anti-realism does indeed lead to moral nihilism.
</br>

### How does moral anti-realism account for moral progress?

If there is no moral reality, then our moral views cannot become better or worse - they cannot make progress. The anti-realist response to this is that people’s moral views can progress if they become more rational, e.g. discovering previously unknown facts, becoming more consistent in their principles, or becoming more coherent in moral judgements.

The anti-realist can also respond that we can make moral progress because we can disapprove of past moral codes and approve of our own. Society has moved on from ‘bad’ moral principles.
</br>

## Metaethics and applied ethics
</br>

### Explain why moral realist theories make little difference to answers in applied ethics

Moral realism means that whether stealing is wrong is dependent upon whether stealing has the property of being wrong. This applies to other ethical issues as well. However, Moral Realism cannot tell us what property wrongness is. Thus, it makes very little difference to applied ethics. It simply supports the thought that what we are doing when we practise applied ethics is trying to discover the truth in answer to the question.

</br>

### How does non-cognitivism respond to questions in applied ethics?

Non-cognitivism responds to ethical questions by claiming that expressions of emotion are satisfactory answers to questions of applied ethics. Even if our views are not true or false, we can still promote expressions of how we want people to behave.
