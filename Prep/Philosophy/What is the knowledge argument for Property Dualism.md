# What is the knowledge argument for Property Dualism?

</br>

### What is property dualism?

[[Philosophy/Glossary#Property dualism|Property dualism]] claims that, although there is just one kind of substance, some mental properties are neither physical nor functional properties, nor behavioural dispositions. Rather, they are properties that do not supervene on physical properties in the way that physicalism claims. Mental properties are a fundamentally different kind of property from physical properties.

### Explain the property dualist approach to:

#### Phenomenal properties

Phenomenal properties cannot be reduced to physical, behavioural or functional properties, and so must be a completely new type of property.
#### Physicalism

Property dualism rejects physicalism entirely, arguing that the properties identified by physics do not form the complete fundamental nature of the universe, because there are also properties of consciousness. Physics is missing something fundamental.
#### Laws of Nature

There may be correlations, even natural laws, that connect particular physical and mental properties, e.g. it may be a law of nature that when an animal has a certain neurological property, it also has a certain conscious experience. However, it is metaphysically possible that these correlations are different, i.e. the properties of consciousness come apart from the physical properties with which they are correlated.

### Explain the differences between the easy and hard minded body problems

The ‘easy’ problem involves the psychological concept of consciousness, analysing and explaining the functions of consciousness. Chalmers argues that understanding how the brain works will eventually provide solutions.

The ‘hard’ problem, by contrast, relates to the phenomenal concept of consciousness, i.e. what it is like to undergo conscious experiences.

### Explain how Jackson’s knowledge/Mary argument can be understood as an argument against:


Suppose there is a neuroscientist, Mary, who has lived all her life in a room in which everything is black and white. She has never see any colour other than black, white and shades of grey. However, she has specialised in the science of vision, and through textbooks and black-and-white TV, she has come to know every physical fact there is to know about colour vision – everything about the properties of light, everything about the eye, everything about the nerves and the brain related to vision. So, Mary knows all the physical information there is to know about what happens when we see a ripe tomato. She is then let out of the black-and-white room, and comes to see something red for the first time. Does she learn something new?

From this thought experiment, the following argument proceeds:

P1: Mary knows all the physical facts about seeing colours before being released from her black-and-white room.

P2: On being released, she learns new facts about seeing colours.

C1: Therefore, not all facts are physical facts, e.g. some facts about colours are not

C2: Therefore, phenomenal properties are non-physical and physicalism is false
#### Mind-brain identity theory

MBTIT claims that sensations are just brain processes, and so it follows that if Mary knows all about brain processes, she knows everything there is to know about sensations. This is precisely the claim which the knowledge argument attacks.
#### Functionalism

The same applies to functionalism: it claims that phenomenal properties are functional properties. The facts that Mary knows include functional facts. Mary knows exactly how the brain functions during an experience of seeing red, but the argument shows that Mary does not know all there is to know about such an experience. Therefore, phenomenal properties are not just functional and physical properties, and so functionalism is false.

#### Hard behaviourism

The knowledge argument claims that Mary knows all about what conditions in someone’s brain would verify whether or not they had a particular colour experience, but she doesn’t know all about colour experiences, because she doesn’t know what it is like to experience colour. Therefore hard behaviourism fails.

#### Soft behaviourism

### Explain the claim that Mary does not gain new propositional knowledge, but does gain ability knowledge

</br>

### How might we respond to this claim?

</br>

### Explain the claim that Mary does not gain new propositional knowledge, but does gain acquaintance knowledge

</br>

### How might we respond to this claim?

</br>

### Explain the claim that Mary *does* gain new propositional knowledge, but that this is knowledge of physical facts that she already knew in a new way

</br>

### How successful is the knowledge/Mary argument in establishing a case for Property Dualism?
