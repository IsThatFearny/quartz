# Idealism Summary Page

Proposed by Bishop Berkeley, Idealism asserts that the world consists solely of physical objects made up of bundles of ideas, observed by the mind of god (or a similar entity). He comes to this conclusion through following logical process. Much of his theory is exemplified in his *Three Dialogues*.

Berkeley states that all that we perceive are primary and secondary qualities. Secondary qualities, as already proposed by Indirect Realism, are subject to perceptual variation. But Berkeley states that primary qualities may also fluctuate depending upon the circumstances under which an individual views them. He gives the example of size, saying that a mouse may see something in a very different way than a human, and also gives the example that a leaf may look very different under a microscope than when observed with the naked eye. Therefore, both primary and secondary qualities are mind-dependent, and, because all that we perceive are primary and secondary qualities, it can be concluded that everything that we perceive is mind-dependent.

In Berkeley’s *Three Dialogues*, Hylas proposes that all objects must have a material substratum, i.e. something binding their qualities together. However, Berkeley, under the guise of Philonous, rejects this, saying that we have no conception of this independently of the qualities of an object. Physical objects are no more than their primary and secondary qualities.

Berkeley goes on to state that these ‘ideas’ of perception must stem from a separate mind, namely God’s. By his account, this is evident as physical objects are no more than their qualities , these ideas are passive and cannot cause perception, therefore there must be something else controlling our perception. Thus, he comes to the conclusion of our perception being caused by God, because it is so complex, ordered and regular that there is no other possible explanation of it. It is also said that we perceive copies of the ideas in God’s mind.

Berkeley also puts forward what is termed his ‘master argument’, which is as follows: We may not conceive of any mind-independent object in our minds, as the very act of apprehending that object in our minds causes it to become mind-dependent, i.e. you may not think of a tree that exists unobserved, as you are observing it by thinking about it.

In a similar vein, Berkely proposes his reasoning behind his rejection of the argument that things may exist unobserved. He says that whilst they may not be observed by a human individual (or any creature for that matter), they are always observed by God through his omnipresence. 

Hallucination and Illusion are the two objections which plagued Indirect Realism, but Idealism seems to solve these. In the case of illusion, we are simply making false inferences about our perception, and with hallucination, we may distinguish it from reality by stating that a hallucination is an idea that is not coherently connected with our experience. In this way, Idealism overcomes the two main problems with Indirect Realism.
