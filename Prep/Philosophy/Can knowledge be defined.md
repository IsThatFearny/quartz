# Can knowledge be defined?
</br>

## Questions
</br>

### What are conditional statements? Give an example
Conditional statements relate the truth of two propositions, and take the form 'if x, then y'. For example, 'if it is raining, then I am getting wet'
</br>

### Look at the definitions of 'antecedent' and 'consequent' in the glossary at the back of the book. Write your own version of these definitions

- Antecedent: The propositional statement that comes after 'if' in a conditional statement. Implies cause, e.g. 'if it rains'
- Consequent: The propositional statement that comes after 'then' in a conditional statement. Implies effect/consequence, e.g. 'then I will get wet' 

</br>

### What is:
#### a) A necessary condition?
A necessary condition is a condition that must be met for the conditional statement to be correct
#### b) A sufficient condition?
A sufficient condition is a proposition for another when the first cannot be true while the other is false
</br>

### How are necessary and sufficient conditions useful in providing definitions?
Necessary and sufficient conditions are useful for providing definitions in terms of something else, e.g. Defining a bachelor in terms of being an unmarried man
</br>

### Explain the claim that 'p is true' is a necessary condition for knowledge, but is not a sufficient condition
We cannot have knowledge of P if P is false, so it is a necessary condition. However, it is not enough to be a sufficient condition for knowledge, as there are many other true propositions that we do not know.
</br>

### How can we use counterexamples to test whether a definition is successful or not?
A counterexample is an instance that rules out a certain claim. If a statement has both necessary and sufficient conditions, we can use a counterexample to attempt to prove that a condition is not necessary.
</br>

### What makes a good definition?
A good definition should not be circular and should not use the concept that is being defined. If a definition can be positive, it should not be negative. A good definition should also be informative
</br>

## Exam Question

### Explain the method of finding necessary and sufficient conditions to define a concept
To test for sufficient conditions, you must swap the conditional around to see if it still makes sense. If it does, then the condition is sufficient.
To test for necessary conditions, you must determine if A relies on B for it to be true. If it does, then the condition is necessary.
