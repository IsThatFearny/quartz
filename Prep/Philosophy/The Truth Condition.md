# The Truth Condition
 <aside>e.g claiming the earth is flat: it looks flat, things would roll of the edge, = compelling evidence</aside>
The truth condition is fairly uncontroversial. It states that for something to be classed as knowledge, it must be true. Just because you think you know something does not mean that you actually know it, because if it is false, then it is not actually knowledge, but a belief.
</br>

<aside>Knowledge requires true belief, as truth exists in the correspondence between belief and fact</aside>
</br>
The truth condition becomes more hotly debated when an understanding of truth is required. A popular definition is a correspondence between belief and objective reality. Simply put, if you believe that something is the case, and in reality it is, then the case is true, and vice versa. 
</br>


However, there are also other definitions of truth, such as the coherence theory, which states that a belief is true if it is part of a 'web of beliefs' held by society to be true.<aside>What we think is true now may be proven false in future. We cannot claim to know real truth</aside> This belief integrates and relies upon other beliefs, whether justified or not. This web of beliefs is inescapable, as we hold certain things to be true, and it is entirely possible that our web of beliefs contains falsehoods within it. According to this theory, people in different time periods 'knew' things that we have now proven false, but their knowledge is not invalidated by our evidence.
