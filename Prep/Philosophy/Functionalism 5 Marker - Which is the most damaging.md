# Functionalism 5 Marker - Which is the most damaging?

Block argues that it is possible for two systems to have states with identical functions, but one system has phenomenal properties while the other does not.

Block proposes a specific thought experiment: he proposes a human body that is connected to the whole population of China via electric transmitters. The Chinese have two way radios, and for a short time, the population realises the same machine table that describes the functions of your mental states. If functionalism holds, Block argues, then this should create a mind, but it is difficult to believe that there is a Chinese consciousness. The Chinese system, although a duplication of your functioning, cannot duplicate your mind because some mental states are qualia, and the system canâ€™t have qualia because they are not functional states.


The most damaging objection to [[Philosophy/Glossary#functionalism|functionalism]] is the objection from inverted qualia.
