# Direct Realism Summary Page

</br>

Direct realism is a theory of perception which states that what we see is what truly exists, and that our perception is empirical evidence for the existence of mind-independent physical objects. If I see a brown table in a room, then a Direct Realist would argue that the table, as I see it, truly does exist.

However, there are numerous counter-arguments to Direct Realism, the most common one being the argument from perceptual variation. Russel presents this argument neatly, using the brown table as his example. Say that there is a brown table in a room. From one perspective, this table may appear brown, but with spots of light from overhead lights reflecting upon it. From another perspective, these spots of light may be in a different place, or indeed not present at all. The argument, therefore, asks how can we really know that the table is brown, or indeed a table at all, when our perception of it differs under different circumstances? Another issue that plagues Direct Realism is the argument from hallucination. This argument simply asks 'how can we know that what we are perceiving is not a dream or a hallucination?'. It argues that there is no way to tell dreams and hallucinations apart from objective reality, and therefore the statement that 'what we see is what exists' must be doubted under these circumstances. Yet another argument against direct realism is that from illusion. In a very similar vein to hallucination, the argument asks 'how can we be sure that our senses are correct, and are not being manipulated by something or changed by another party?'. The answer to this is we cannot, and therefore Direct Realism is rendered invalid. In addition to this, a final issue that faces Direct Realism is time-lag. We know that, when we touch something, there is a slight delay in us touching it and registering that sensation. Therefore, this argument says, we are not *directly* perceiving it, as it is not immediate and instantaneous (Indirect Realism responds to this by proposing sense-data as a medium through which we perceive)  

Direct Realism, whilst a very simple and easy to understand theory of perception, fails to respond satisfactorily to these counter-arguments, and therefore we may look for another theory of perception that addresses these key issues.

# Indirect Realism Summary Page
</br>

Indirect Realism is a theory of perception, stemming from an attempt to solve the problems that plague Direct Realism (what you see is what is), such as Perceptual Variation, Illusion, Hallucination and Time-Lag. It states that we perceive all mind-independent physical objects indirectly, through sense-data. Sense-data is the data that our senses provide us through perception, and is a medium through which we perceive the external world.

In order to resolve the main argument against Direct Realism, perceptual variation, Indirect Realism states that every physical object has two types of qualities: primary and secondary. A primary quality is a property that an object has regardless of how it is shaped, moved, or divided, for example shape (i.e. atomic structure). These are fixed and constant. In contrast to this, a secondary quality is a property that changes circumstantially, such as when an object is moved, when light changes, or when the perspective of the observer is changed, for example temperature and colour. This distinction between primary and secondary qualities explains how perceptual variation can exist. 

There is an argument to be made that Indirect Realism leads to scepticism. For example, the idea of a 'veil of perception' is a common criticism, implying that because our sense-data comes between us and the external world, we cannot know anything about the external world, even of it's existence. However, Locke and other defenders of Indirect Realism argue that this misrepresents the argument: Sense-data is not a barrier to the external world, but a medium through which we perceive it, and therefore this 'veil of perception' argument is rendered invalid. In addition to the veil of perception argument, critics (especially Berkely) say that Indirect Realism leads to scepticism about the very nature of physical objects. Berkely argues that sense-data (and by extension secondary qualities) is "perpetually fleeting and variable", whereas mind-independent physical objects, if they exist, are "fixed and constant". Berkely's argument is that these two things cannot possibly be alike due to the difference in these properties. Russell's argument against this is that Indirect Realism is simply the 'best hypothesis', and the most simple way of understanding the external world. He argues that there is no way to actually prove that the external world exists, but the most logical, simple, and therefore 'best' explanation is that it does.
