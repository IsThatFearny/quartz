# Indirect Realism Summary Page
</br>

Indirect Realism is a theory of perception, stemming from an attempt to solve the problems that plague Direct Realism (what you see is what is), such as Perceptual Variation, Illusion, Hallucination and Time-Lag. It states that we perceive all mind-independent physical objects indirectly, through sense-data. Sense-data is the data that our senses provide us through perception, and is a medium through which we perceive the external world.

In order to resolve the main argument against Direct Realism, perceptual variation, Indirect Realism states that every physical object has two types of qualities: primary and secondary. A primary quality is a property that an object has regardless of how it is shaped, moved, or divided, for example shape (i.e. atomic structure). These are fixed and constant. In contrast to this, a secondary quality is a property that changes circumstantially, such as when an object is moved, when light changes, or when the perspective of the observer is changed, for example temperature and colour. This distinction between primary and secondary qualities explains how perceptual variation can exist. 

There is an argument to be made that Indirect Realism leads to scepticism. For example, the idea of a 'veil of perception' is a common criticism, implying that because our sense-data comes between us and the external world, we cannot know anything about the external world, even of it's existence. However, Locke and other defenders of Indirect Realism argue that this misrepresents the argument: Sense-data is not a barrier to the external world, but a medium through which we perceive it, and therefore this 'veil of perception' argument is rendered invalid. In addition to the veil of perception argument, critics (especially Berkely) say that Indirect Realism leads to scepticism about the very nature of physical objects. Berkely argues that sense-data (and by extension secondary qualities) is "perpetually fleeting and variable", whereas mind-independent physical objects, if they exist, are "fixed and constant". Berkely's argument is that these two things cannot possibly be alike due to the difference in these properties. Russel's argument against this is that Indirect Realism is simply the 'best hypothesis', and the most simple way of understanding the external world. He argues that there is no way to actually prove that the external world exists, but the most logical, simple, and therefore 'best' explanation is that it does.
