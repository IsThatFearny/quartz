# Non-hedonistic Utilitarianism
</br>

## a) Is pleasure the only good? Smart on hedonistic and non-hedonistic Utilitarianism

</br>

### Explain Smart's characterisation of G.E. Moore as an 'ideal' utilitarian
G.E. Moore believed that certain states of mind, such as knowledge, are also 'good' as well as pleasure. This is opposed to Bentham's hedonism.

</br>

### Explain Smart's agreement with Mill (against Bentham) that pleasures are not all equal, with reference to the 'electrodes in the brain' scenario
Smart agrees with Mill with the concept of 'better a human satisfied than a pig dissatisfied', referring to a scenario in which you are wired up with electrodes. At the press of a button, these electrodes will provide you with intense sensual pleasure, with no ill effects. Smart then goes on to ask what would we think of this, and would we condemn it as forsaking 'higher' pleasures?
</br>

### Explain Smart's disagreement with Mill over the issue of the quality of pleasure, and the interpretation of the higher/lower distinction that results
Smart claims that Mill is not a pure hedonist. Mill's view can only defend the place of higher pleasures in terms of their fecundity. Smart says that Mill's concept of happiness is evaluative. Happiness is pleasure of which we approve. This interprets 'higher' pleasures as not higher at all


</br>

### Explain Smart's defence of hedonism
Smart defends hedonism by saying that no pleasure is intrinsically bad, and it is only ever bad if it causes pain to oneself or others
</br>

## b) Nozick's experience machine
</br>

### Summarise Nozick's 'experience machine'
Nozick proposes the possibility of being plugged into a machine which will produce the experience of a very happy life, along with various pleasures, few pains, and great success. In this machine, we will not know that this reality is fake, and we would believe that we are actually living these experiences. The catch is, you must choose either to plug in for life, or not at all. 

</br>

### Explain Nozick's argument against hedonism based on the claim that most of us would not plug in

Nozick argues that the majority would not take this chance, as we value being in contact with reality, despite the possible loss of happiness. Nozick says that we cannot quantify nor qualify this as 'pleasure', and instead it is a relation to something outside our minds. Nozick agrees with Smart that we want achievements, but goes further to say that we want 'real' achievements, and not the state of mind of achievement. Nozick therefore concludes that we cannot understand what is good based off our subjective psychological states.
</br>

## c) Preference Utilitarianism

</br>

### What is Preference Utilitarianism?

Preference Utilitarianism is a form which argues that we should aim to maximise the satisfaction of desires/preferences, not pleasure
</br>

### Summarise the three arguments for Preference Utilitarianism

1) Having a preference satisfied is valuable, but not necessarily because it brings us pleasure. For a preference to be satisfied, it must be satisfied in reality
2) Preference explains Mill's 'higher and lower pleasures' claim. What people prefer is of more value to them.
3) Preference satisfaction is not based upon pleasure, as many preferences will not bring us pleasure (e.g. after death, etc.). If more people prefer the absence of plain to the existence of pleasure, then it can be considered important not to cause harm
</br>

### Summarise the claim that Preference Utilitarianism offers a more unified account of what is valuable than Hedonistic Utilitarianism, and that it simplifies Smart's theory

Preference Utilitarianism allows us to claim that happiness is the only good with the understanding that happiness is defined as one's preferences being satisfied. Pleasure is important when it is a result of satisfied preferences

Smart's theory does not define happiness in terms of what is 'good', whereas Preference Utilitarianism can say that what is good is maximising preference satisfaction. Approval is not relevant at all.
