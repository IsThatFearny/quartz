# MBTIT Speech

Mind-brain type identity theory, the claim that mental properties *just are* physical properties, is a very poor attempt to liken mental and physical properties, and here I shall explain why.

Putnam argues that mental properties cannot be identical to physical properties because the same mental property can supervene onto different physical properties. For example, brain states that relate to pain are likely different depending upon the species in which they are exhibited. If we say that this is true, then the physical properties displayed by different creatures must be dissimilar. Therefore, we can argue that mental properties cannot be exactly the same as physical properties. Putnam names this argument the argument from ‘multiple realisability’. Many different neurophysiological properties could realise (‘realise’ of course meaning ‘to give form to’ or ‘to bring into reality’) pain, and so pain cannot be identical to any of these. We may go further and consider other mental states and extra-terrestrial species. An entirely separate evolutionary process would make it incredibly unlikely that these extra-terrestrials share the same physical states as us. But, MBTIT claims that a mental state just is to have a physical state. Thus, we can argue that MBTIT is a highly implausible theory, and one that should not be taken seriously.

In objecting to MBTIT, we may also posit multiple further arguments, taken from certain dualist theories. Descartes’ indivisibility argument argues that the mind cannot be identical to the brain because the mind is indivisible, whilst the brain is. This is, of course, an objection to MBTIT. Whilst the mind-brain type identity theorist may argue otherwise (namely that the indivisibility argument assumes that the mind is a ‘thing’ which can have the property of indivisibility), it is my opinion that this argument still holds. 

Descartes’ conceivability argument is also used as an objection to MBTIT. Because what is conceivable is metaphysically possible, it is metaphysically possible for a mental state to exist in the absence of the brain state which MBTIT claims it is identical to. If one thing can exist in the absence of another, then they are distinct things, and thus mental states cannot be brain states.

I hope that, after I have presented these arguments in objection to MBTIT, that you will understand the numerous flaws and errors that the theory presents.
