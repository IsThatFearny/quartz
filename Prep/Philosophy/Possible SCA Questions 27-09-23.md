- Is Moral Naturalism satisfactory/correct?
	- Moral naturalism is the claim that moral properties are natural properties
	- It is a cognitive and realist view - moral judgements are beliefs that are intended to be true or false, and they exist
	- Utilitarianism is a form of moral naturalism - ‘good’ can be reduced to pleasure, ‘bad’ can be reduced to pain, both of which are ‘natural’ properties
		- Mill’s proof of utilitarianism as a metaethical argument: The only proof that something is desirable is that people desire it; the general happiness is desirable simply because people desire their own happiness; because people desire the general happiness, happiness is good; our other values such as truth, dignity, etc. constitute what makes us happy; therefore, happiness is the only good
	- Virtue ethics is also a form of moral naturalism - Aristotle’s discussion of *ergon* is a discussion of natural facts about humans, e.g. it is a natural fact that the *ergon* of humans is to use reason. ‘Good’ can be reduced to natural facts about function and the satisfaction of said function.
	- Moore argues against moral naturalism in the form of the *naturalistic fallacy*. This is the fallacy of equation good with a natural property such as pleasure. For example, it would not be logical to conclude that drinking beer is good, simply from the fact that one may find it pleasurable. He says that even if the two are closely correlated, this doesn’t follow that they are the same thing. Therefore, Moore would argue that Mill’s proof is invalid.
	- Hume presents the issue of the is-ought gap. *Is* statements are factual claims, whereas *ought* statements are value judgements. There is a gap between these claims - we cannot derive *ought* statements from *is* statements. For example, Hume would argue that an *is* statement such as ‘Smith murdered Jones’ are capable of being true or false, whereas *ought* statements such as ‘Smith should not have murdered Jones’ are expressions of emotion that are not capable of truth nor falsehood.
	- Ayer argues that moral naturalism is flawed, because it fails the verification principle (statements are only meaningful if they are analytically true and empirically verifiable). Proving that murder causes pain, anger, etc. is not the same as proving that it is wrong. We cannot empirically verify it.
- Is moral non-naturalism satisfactory/correct?
- Is error theory satisfactory/correct?
- Is prescriptivism satisfactory/correct?
- is emotivism satisfactory/correct?
