# What is Phenomenalism

</br>

### What is the central claim of linguistic phenomenalism?

The central claim is that despite the fact that we talk about mind-independent physical objects as if they *do* exist, we are actually simply referring to patterns of sense-data that we experience, or 'phenomena'. Linguistic phenomenalism therefore states that all talk of physical objects can be translated into talk of sense-data without losing any meaning whatsoever.

</br>

### How is this claim supported by our understanding of how we learn language?

It can be observed that all the vocabulary that we learn as we are growing up is simply a name attributed to a pattern of sense-data. A name for a physical object is just shorthand for a description of the sense-data that we perceive.

</br>

### How can the example of fictional film characters help us to understand this?

We attach a name to a fictional film character who may appear on our screen, despite all that connects this name to them being a pattern of colours on our televisions. The character has no existence independently of our perception in this case. This, the phenomenalist argues, is the same principle that applies to everything that we perceive. All objects can be reduced to collections of sense-data.
</br>

### How might we 'translate' our usual way of talking about physical objects into the phenomenalist's way of talking about them? And what is the implication of our ability to do so?

The textbook gives the example of translating this expression: 'The melon rolls across the wooden table and knocks over a glass'; into this expression: 'A round yellow patch rotates and moves left across the brown expanse reaching a transparent, hard, container-shaped collection of sense-data which turns suddenly downwards'. The implication of this is that it causes belief in the existence of mind-independent physical objects to become redundant. We are able to make do with sense-data alone.

### Translate the words and statements in the activity box into phenomenalist language

'Boiled egg': 'Elliptical, white object, encompassing a yellow, round core'

'Water': ' Transparent fluid'

'Banana': 'Long yellow curve, with thick outer layer which can be opened to reveal edible inner layer'
</br>

### How does phenomenalism deal with the issue of unperceived objects (and thus avoid the issue of 'the god conclusion' in idealism)?

Instead of explaining perception through the independent existence of physical objects (as the realist does), the phenomenalist appeals to the continuing possibilities of experience, which can be triggered by the suitable conditions, i.e. If someone is in the right place at the right time, then they will experience certain sense-data. Thus, 'the god conclusion' arrived at by Berkeley is rendered invalid, as he came to that conclusion through arguing that 'nothing can exist unperceived, and therefore everything must be observed by god'
</br>

### How does phenomenalism overcome scepticism?

Phenomenalism closes the gap between our experience and the external world. Instead of stating 'there is a table in this room' and meaning that there is a literal table in the room (this can be doubted) as a realist would, the phenomenalist simply states that 'there is a table in the room', meaning that if they were to stand in this room, they would perceive sense-data resembling a table. This is true whether they are dreaming or not.
