# What is Physicalism?

</br>

### Why and how has materialism been ‘rebranded’ as physicalism?

Physics has shown that matter is a poor identification of the most basic substance in existence. Thus, by re-working materialism, philosophers have been able to refine the claim from being about what type of substance exists to include other conditions as well.

### How can we summarise the physicalist approach? (Include the basic and developed versions)

Everything that exists is either physical or entirely dependent upon something that is physical (Physical meaning something that falls under the laws of physics and whose essential properties can be identified and described by physics).

To develop this, we can say that the properties identified by physics form the fundamental nature of the universe. Physical laws govern all objects and events in space-time. Every physical event has a physical cause that brings it about in accordance with the laws of physics.

### Explain the three ways in which mental properties are ontologically dependent on other properties.

Elimination: Mental properties do not exist. This is eliminative materialism. Some of our basic concepts such as consciousness or intentionality are fundamentally mistaken as they do not refer to anything that exists.

Identity: Mental properties are just types of physical properties. Neurological properties of the brain are physical properties, and depend on other more fundamental physical properties. Thus, mental properties are synonymous with neurological properties, and these are simply physical properties which depend on more fundamental physical properties.

Dependent but distinct: Mental properties are not physical properties of the brain, but they are entirely dependent upon physical properties.

### What is supervenience? And how is it relevant to discussions about metaphysics of mind?

Supervenience is the idea that properties of type A supervene on properties of type B just in case any two things that are exactly alike in their B properties cannot have different A properties. This is relevant to discussions about metaphysics of mind because if two things have the same physical properties, then according to supervenience they must have the same menta properties

### Explain the claim that everything depends on what is physical, with reference to the levels of existence.

Physical properties, according to physicalism, ‘fix’ all of the other properties in such a way that it is not physically possible for any other property to change without changing the physical properties. We can picture this using the ‘levels’ of existence. Elementary particles and forces form the basis of this, and we can add a layer of complexity by supervening atoms onto this. We repeat this with molecules, cells, organs, living things, social groups, etc.

### Explain the claim that ‘what is physical is metaphysically fundamental’.

In talking about what is ‘possible’ and ‘impossible’, physicalists mean not
just physical possibility, but metaphysical possibility. Applying this to the
mind, this means either that mental properties don’t exist at all, or that they
are identical with certain physical properties, or that they supervene on
physical properties.
