### What is the difference between *a priori* knowledge and *a posteriori* knowledge? (3 Marks)

A posteriori knowledge is that which can only be known after or from experience. In contrast, a priori knowledge is knowledge that can be known before experience. This means that we can have knowledge of the world without experiencing it. For example, analytical truths such as ‘1 + 1 = 2’ is a priori knowledge, because it can be gained without experience.

### Explain the view that the mind is a ‘tabula rasa’ at birth. (5 marks)

The view that the mind is a ‘tabula rasa’ at birth was one proposed by Locke. Tabula rasa roughly translates to ‘blank slate’, and the theory describes the mind of a newborn as such. According to this theory, at birth we have no a priori knowledge, and as we experience the world our mind is populated with ideas and concepts. This is an empiricist view, stating that all our concepts derive from two different sources - Sensation and reflection. Sensation is our experience perceived through senses (such as vision, hearing, etc.), and reflection is experience gained through introspection. These are the only two sources from which we can gain knowledge.

### Explain Descartes’ third ‘wave of doubt’. (5 marks)

Descartes’ third ‘wave of doubt’ is his claim that it is possible for God to not exist, and for all of our experiences to be controlled and produced by an evil demon who’s only intention is to deceive. We have no way of knowing if this is the case, because my experiences would remain the same either way. Descartes uses this possibility as a way of making sure that he doesn’t believe anything that he cannot know. It makes it seem as if he cannot know anything. Unless this possibility can be ruled out, then we cannot be certain of anything, and thus we reach global scepticism.

### Explain how an account of epistemic virtue can be used to show why Smith lacks knowledge in one of Gettier’s original counter-examples. (12 marks)

Virtue epistemology is a branch which focuses on epistemic virtue as a central pillar. Our epistemic (or ‘intellectual’) virtues are faculties such as vision, memory, introspection, and the like. The virtue epistemologist claims that we may form knowledge through the use of epistemic virtue, deeming these to be reliable sources of information.

This theory of knowledge can be applied to Gettier’s original counter-examples. The example that we shall use here is that of Smith and Jones: Smith and Jones both apply for a job. During the interview process, Smith is told by the boss that Jones will get the job. Smith notices that Jones has 10 coins in his pocket, and thus forms the proposition that ‘the man with ten coins in his pocket will get the job’. Unbeknownst to Smith, he too has ten coins in his pocket, and he ends up getting the job. This would seem to be a case of accidental knowledge, as Smith’s proposition is true by coincidence, and therefore, Gettier argues, should not be counted as knowledge. However, under the tripartite view, Smith has knowledge. Virtue epistemology serves to prove that Smith does not have knowledge. It requires that knowledge fulfils three criteria: accuracy (is the belief accurate?), adroitness (did the belief arise out of epistemic virtue?), and aptness (is intellectual virtue applied aptly?). In the case of Smith and Jones, Smith’s belief is accurate, apt, and yet it is not adroit, because Smith’s belief was accurate out of pure coincidence. In bridging the gap between truth and justification that allows Gettier cases to be constructed, virtue epistemology overcomes these counter-examples successfully.

### Is Berkeley’s idealist account of perception convincing? (25 marks)

Berkeleyan idealism is the claim that reality is dependent upon minds, and that any object must be perceived for it to exist. It states that only minds and the things that they perceive exist. Nothing independent of these can exist. In this essay, I will argue that Berkeleyan idealism is a convincing theory of perception. 

Locke makes the distinction between primary and secondary qualities, stating that whilst primary qualities are mind-independent, secondary qualities are mind-dependent. Berkeley agrees with the idea that secondary qualities (such as colour, temperature, etc.) are mind-dependent, but also argues that primary qualities are mind-dependent too. Secondary qualities, he says, are subject to perceptual variation, and because this is cause to believe that all secondary qualities are purely appearances or sense-data, they are mind-dependent. The same is true for primary qualities, he argues. What looks small to a human may look huge to a smaller animal, microscopic differences cannot be seen by the naked eye, and as we move closer to an object its size seems to change. Therefore, Berkeley argues, we cannot say whether physical objects have any properties independent of how it is perceived, and the primary qualities of an object are mind-dependent in a similar way to secondary qualities. Berkeley goes further and argues that everything we perceive is either a primary or secondary quality, and because both of these are mind-dependent, nothing that we perceive can exist independently of our mind. This is the basis of his idealism. Critics argue that this argument does not show that mind-independent objects do not exist, because it is entirely possible that they could exist unperceived. However, Berkeley clarifies his position in response to this.


Berkeley’s first argument in response is that of a ‘material substratum’. He argues that there is no ‘material substratum’ (a substance that binds properties together to make an object) that can exist unperceived. A material substratum is never perceived as it is distinct from primary and secondary qualities, and Berkeley has already argued that we cannot perceive anything other than these. He claims that you cannot speak of a table independent of its qualities, for you talk of nothing. We can say nothing of how physical substance exists. Locke accepts this argument. Berkeley then goes on to argue that reason nor experience supports the claim that we perceive physical objects. Because all that we perceive are mind-dependent properties, our experience cannot attest to the existence of a mind-independent external world. It is not even suggested by our experience. Close attention paid to experience therefore supports the claim that all we can say there is is the content of our experiences. Because all we can experience are simply ideas, experience supports idealism. Berkeley’s final argument in response to this is that if there were mind-independent physical objects, we can know nothing about them, as supposing that the object of perception can exist independently of our perception leads to scepticism. These three arguments support idealism to a great extent.

Berkeley makes two more arguments in favour of his idealism: the master argument and his argument of God. The master argument states that we cannot conceive of a mind-independent object, because our very conception of this object causes it to become mind-dependent. However, this argument is criticised, as Berkeley is thought to have equivocated a thought and the content of said thought. Just because my conceiving of a tree is mind-dependent, this does not mean that my conception is also mind-dependent, It is possible that a tree may exist when no-one is thinking of it. The master argument is therefore a poor defence of idealism. Berkeley’s other argument is that all of our ideas come from the mind of God. He says that this is because if all of our ideas and concepts depended upon our own minds, then we would be able to control our perceptions. Because we cannot, our ideas must be sourced from somewhere else. Because all that exists are minds, this source must be another mind, and the complex nature of our perception necessitates that this mind must be the mind of God. Despite criticisms that perceptions are part of my mind, not God’s, and that the objects of our perception are subject to change, and yet God’s mind is eternal (and therefore my ideas cannot stem from the mind of God), Berkeley’s response that our perceptions are simply a copy of what is in God’s mind, and that any changes in my perception are the will of God.

These arguments in favour of idealism face little worthy criticism that Berkeley does not refute. Therefore, I find Idealism to be a convincing theory of perception, for the arguments in favour far overwhelm the criticisms.
