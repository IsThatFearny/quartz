# Act Utilitarianism

</br>

## a) Problems with calculation
</br>

### Explain the criticism that, far from being clear and straightforward, act utilitarianism is too difficult and time consuming

Mill notes that it may not be possible to calculate the utility of an action, or may be far too difficult and time-consuming. Take Bentham's Felicific Calculus for example. Whilst on paper, it may seem easy to understand, in practise it is massively overcomplicated and takes a lot of time to use. In addition, it will likely be impossible to calculate all the relevant information (due to subjectivity, etc.)

</br>

### How might it be argued that the criticism misrepresents the utilitarian argument?

This criticism is a misinterpretation of the argument. Bentham does not say that an action is right if it actually maximises happiness. Instead, he says that an action can be considered to be 'right' if we can reasonably expect it to maximise happiness. In addition, Bentham states that the felicific calculus need not be adhered to completely, but 'kept in view' and used as a guideline

</br>

### Explain Mill's response to this criticism, with reference to 'secondary principles'

Mill responds to this by claiming that we don't actually need to try to work the consequences of an action, as over time, we have already prescribed moral correctness to actions which tend to produce happiness. These are our inherited moral rules, or as Mill calls them, 'secondary principles'. He says that only in cases of moral conflict should there be exceptions to these rules, and that is therefor4ew the only scenario in which we need to calculate to consequences of an action.

### Explain Bentham and Singer's argument that Utilitarianism requires us to take account of the happiness of non-human animals

Bentham argues that, if a being can suffer (or feel pleasure) then it should factored into Utilitarianism. Happiness remains good no matter which creature experiences it. Singer develops this argument, and says that, alike to sexism and racism, placing one species above another is 'speciesism'. Singer states that as long as a creature is sentient and can experience pleasure and suffering, then it should be involved in Utilitarian thinking. Animals, Singer says, should be treated completely equally to humans in this regard.

### What are the implications of having to include animals in Utilitarian calculations?

This argument raises various issues with Utilitarianism. How, for example, are we able to solve such issues as whether we should eat meat, or destroy habitats to make new farms, when the happiness of animals must be factored in. It is near impossible to equate the happiness of a human and a pig, cow, or bird, as there are major differences between them.

## b) Fairness, individual liberty and rights

</br>

### Explain the objection - with specific reference to Mill - that Utilitarianism leads to the 'tyranny of the majority'

Mill is concerned that democratic systems which lead to the greatest happiness for the majority may inflict negative effects on the minority. He notes that there are two ways that the majority can exercise its power over minorities. It can do so through democratic government (e.g. a government could pass a law forbidding people from criticising a certain religion). Mill argues that the powers of a democratic government must be limited by a recognition of individual rights and liberties. However, it could be argued that Utilitarianism doesn't have room for these concepts.

Mill is also concerned with a second way that the majority can exercise power, namely through 'tyranny' of social opinion (societal norms, expectations, etc.).
