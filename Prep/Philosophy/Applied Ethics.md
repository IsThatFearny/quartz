# Applied Ethics

## Simulated Killing

#### What is simulated killing? Why is it a moral issue?

Simulated killing is the enactment of killing in a fictional context, such as in video games. (N.B. There is a difference between witnessing such a thing and enacting it as the player). 

It is a moral issue not because of the action, but because of what is being represented, that is, murder. The question that must be asked is whether it is morally acceptable to take part in this. We may also be concerned over the effects of simulated killing on the people undertaking the action, and on how they treat other people in real life.

#### What are the implications of Utilitarianism for the morality of simulated killing?

Utilitarianism must take into account the risk of harmful behaviour being transferred from this virtual world into real life. We must find empirical evidence to back up any idea that harm is done. However, Garry Young argues that the evidence is not conclusive. Some studies suggest that there is an increased risk of violence after playing a violent video game, whereas others suggest that this increased risk only affects those with a violent disposition in the first place. This is in the short-term. The long-term risks are even more inconclusive, and evidence is considered too weak to make any sort of judgement.

Even if there was evidence that simulated killing had negative effects on the real world, Utilitarianism would only deem it morally wrong if the pain inflicted outweighed the pleasure gained from playing the video game. 

Mill’s higher/lower pleasures distinction comes into play as well. Mill would dismiss such ‘childish’ behaviour as video games as a lower pleasure for adults. We may therefore think worse of an adult who played video games such as these, but not condemn the activity itself.

#### What is the Kantian concern with the morality of simulated killing?

Playing these video games alone is not a violation of one’s moral duty, however, if doing so damages one’s rational will, or leads to neglecting or violating one’s duty to another, then we may object. We can argue that cultivating such cruelty may undermine our willingness and ability to obey the second formulation of the Categorical Imperative. However, as with Utilitarianism, there is insufficient empirical evidence to suggest a link between simulated killing and a neglect of moral duty.

It may also be argued that, even if we do not fail in our duties to others, we may fail in our duty to ourselves. Perhaps repeatedly engaging in this activity erodes our sense of identity. However, it is unclear whether this is true.

#### How can Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean be applied to simulated killing?

Aristotle might say that simulated killing is wrong if it prevents the development of virtue and so prevents the gamer from achieving eudaimonia. This is because we may become unjust by doing unjust acts, which could arise from excessive acts of simulated killing.

The doctrine of the mean is agent-specific, and so will differ depending on who it is applied to. It may be virtuous for someone who understands the difference between the content of the game and reality, because their enjoyment of the game and the adrenaline that they may get from it is a helpful and safe expression of natural human aggression. However, a different person who does not understand this difference may not be virtuous when playing the game, because they may indulge in fantasies of actual killing.

#### What is the significance of the distinction between playing the killer and acting the killer?

‘Acting the killer’ is when the person undertaking the act does so on the understanding that their actions are seen as murder. An actor does not feel murderous rage or any similar emotions, and if they did so, this would be rather disturbing. ‘Playing the killer’, however, is when the gamer may fail to distinguish themselves from their character, and this lack of separation may have moral implications for the gamer.

#### Explain the different relations between simulated killing and morality within a work of fiction

Different relations occur between simulated killing and morality depending on the circumstances. For example, does the author intends the immoral values of murder to be moral values within their fiction, or do they genuinely wish to portray these values as correct? On one hand, there may be something not virtuous about engaging with the immoral imagination of the author, and on the other hand, one may argue that it enables us to understand morality more deeply.

#### Is there anything morally wrong with watching simulated immoral killing?

There is only something morally wrong with watching simulated killing if the viewer engages with the view that killing in real life is correct because of the author’s intentions behind the narrative.

## Lying

### Utilitarianism

#### Explain Mill’s utilitarian position on the morality of lying (with reference to rule utilitarianism)

A simplistic act-utilitarian perspective would see the morality of lying as very easy: if the utility produced by the lie outweighs the negative consequences, then it is good; if not, it is bad. However, Mill’s position is that Utilitarianism should evaluate such actions as part of the big picture. In this case, a person being honest benefits the general happiness, and being able to trust other people is the basis of social well-being and a foundation of our civilisation and of our virtues. Weakening this would be severely damaging to happiness, and so to tell a lie simply for the sake of convenience is morally wrong.

However, Mill says that lying can be morally permissible in certain circumstances. We have to evaluate these circumstances to calculate the amount of pleasure or displeasure that will be produced from the action. Mill uses Kant’s example of the would-be murderer who asks you where his victim is. The harm done by lying about the whereabouts of said victim is far outweighed by the good done by saving a life, and thus lying is morally permissible.

The rule utilitarian may argue that a rule stating ‘don’t lie’ would produce more pleasure than a rule that permitted lying. However, Mill objects to this: never lying will lead to harm in certain circumstances. A rule would have to be created that allows for exceptions, but these exceptions are quite varied, and so this rule would be difficult to formulate. It is hard to know what the right rule for lying should be.

### Kantian Deontology

#### Explain why Kant contends that lying is wrong and how that contention might be challenged

Kant states that making a false promise is immoral, because it makes a contradiction in conception. The same is true for lying. If everyone lied, then people would stop believing each other. But you can only lie if the person believes you. Thus, the maxim cannot be universalised, and lying is immoral. However, the maxim that we act upon may be more specific than ‘lie whenever I want’. For example, it could be ‘to lie in order to save a life’. This can be universalised, because in most situations in which we lie, no lives are at stake. People would still believe each other most of the time.

#### What is the further argument against lying that Kant adds in his essay on lying and how might it be challenged?

Kant also argues that we do not know the consequences that will follow from us lying. It is always possible that we are mistaken, and if so, we have failed to do our duty, achieved nothing, and we are responsible for the results. It is therefore better to do our duty. However, this can be challenged, because we are similarly responsible when we tell the truth for the consequences, however negative they may be.

#### With reference to the second formulation of the categorical imperative, explain how lying involves treating the other as a means rather than as an end

The second formulation of the categorical imperative states that we should always treat other humans as ends in themselves, not as means to an end. Lying breaks this imperative, because they are not able to make an informed choice about what to do, and are manipulated without their knowledge. It is impossible for them to share in our ends, because they do not have the knowledge of what our ends actually are. Even fi the other person’s ends are immoral, and the only way to prevent them is to lie, we still should not lie, because we would be deceiving them about our intentions to thwart their own ends.

### Virtue Ethics

#### Summarise Aristotle’s approach to truthfulness

Aristotle approaches truthfulness and lying as two extremes, in between which there is no correct action. Lying is a vice of excess already, and so cannot be virtuous. His other interpretation is that truth is a final end, and that lying is not always wrong, because their are situations in which it is appropriate.

#### How might an Aristotelian virtue ethicist justify lying?

Lying might be justifiable in that we are able to use practical wisdom to determine in which circumstances we may lie. If we wish to lie, and to do it virtuously, we would have to go about it in the right way, about the right things, with the right motive, and at the right time. It may also be justified if it is the last resort after exhausting all other options
