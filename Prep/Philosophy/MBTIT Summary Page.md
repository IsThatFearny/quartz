# MBTIT Summary Page
</br>

- MBTIT claims that there is only one kind of substance, and that mental properties *just are* physical properties. This reduces mental properties to physical ones
- However, it is not the claim that mental concepts mean the same thing was physical concepts, but that two distinct mental and physical concepts refer to the same property
- This theory is appealing because it is simpler than others (Occam’s razor). It is able to explain the mind without appealing to anything beyond physical properties
- One criticism of the theory is that of ‘multiple realisability’. This is the argument that it is empirically or conceptually possible for two creatures to have the same mental property, such as ‘being in pain’, but to have differing physical properties. Thus, the mental cannot be identical to the physical
