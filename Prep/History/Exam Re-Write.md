## The main reason for the Tory domination of British politics in the period 1951-64 was the weakness and divisions of the Labour Party. ATVOV

In the period 1951-1964, the Conservative party dominated the political stage, working through four prime ministers in the process. Also during this period, the Labour Party were divided on many issues which made it difficult for them to unite as one party, an issue which the Tories took advantage of to empower themselves. However, this was not the sole reason for the Tory domination of British politics. This essay shall analyse the influence of Labour divisions and their division of support, the global stage and how it aided the Conservatives’ image, and Tory achievements and their effect upon the electorate, in order to determine the primary reason for the Tory chokehold on politics.

Having lost the election in 1951 to Churchill, the Labour Party were split down the middle. The Bevanite rebellion, caused by arguments over dentistry and optometry charges (an unpopular decision, as it undermined the very nature of the NHS as a free healthcare provider), caused significant debate, as did the issues of nationalisation and union policy. Infighting was rife, and the party had very little unified policy. Their policy was limited, because they could not gather support from their own party, let alone get bi-partisan support. This meant that Labour did not provide much competition to the Tory party, and the Tory majority grew and grew over the course of their term in power due to Labour’s inability to respond as a unit. They were mocked in the House of Commons, and their welfare system achievements of the 1940’s such as the NHS and the benefits system were largely forgotten. Labour were simply unable to gain the support that they had previously lost, as a rift had opened between labour voters as well. Frustrated with tough union policy and lack of nationalisation of key industries, many members of the working class turned to the Conservatives as their saviours, and so Labour lost more support. This was the embourgeoisement thesis in action: the more affluent a society becomes, the more votes that their Conservative party (or similar) gets. This is because Conservative policy is now targeted for their benefit. The failure of the Labour Party to provide unified policy in order to win back the support of the working class played a major role in their inability to win an election, as did the divisions in the party and their overwhelming weakness.

Not only were Labour weak, the Tories found strength in their newfound situation. The welfare system established by the Labour government of previous years, a respite from austerity measures, and a bounce-back after the war all contributed towards the creation of an affluent society. Wages doubled, car purchases quadrupled, and Britons were now, more than ever, able to live luxurious lives, due to the higher standards of living in Britain. Millions tuned in to watch the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on their newly acquired television sets. Hire-purchase allowed the rental of new technologies  such as dishwashers, washing machines, and refrigerators. This took the stress out of being a housewife, and women were now freer to go to work and earn a living. Harold Macmillan summed it up well: “You’ve never had it so good”. The rise of the affluent society created vast amounts of support for the Conservatives, and the Tory majority increased from 17 in 1951, to 60 under Anthony Eden in 1955, and then to 100 under Harold Macmillan in 1957. The economic fairings of Britain had never been better, and this success was attributed to the Tory Party. However, they did not deserve all of the credit for this. Much of the increase in living standards was caused by a global boom. Britain was at the bottom, comparatively, in terms of growth. Britain’s share in world trade had only decreased, from 25% in 1950 to just 15% in 1962. Compared to West Germany, who’s share had risen from 7% to 20% in the same period, and it is clear to see that Britain’s economy was not as strong as it seemed. On the world stage, Britain’s prospects were dismal. The Tory party looked as if they had performed an economic miracle domestically, but if you look internationally, Tory success was greatly overvalued. The global stage caused the Tory party to look a lot better than they actually were, and caused voters to vote for them in the name of further economic growth.

The Conservative Party did find success of their own volition too, however. Nuclear weapons were a major part of this. The purchase of Polaris submarines in 1962, armed with British warheads, and thus the creation of a British nuclear deterrent (although this was lost in 1964), generated significant support for the Tories during this period, as did the securing of IMF loans. Additionally, the further development of the welfare system was hailed a great victory, But these successes were significantly undermined by the numerous failures of the Conservative Party. For one, the Suez Crisis caused large discontent amongst the electorate, who were against the invasion of Egypt. The Conservatives had also gradually built up a balance of payments deficit, which totalled £800 million when they left office. These were serious failings, and neutralised most of the support that they had gained from their previous success. Therefore, Tory successes were not as much of a contributing factor to the Tory domination of this period.

To conclude, the view that the main reason for the Tory domination of British politics in the period 1951-1964 was the weakness and divisions of the Labour party is invalid. Whilst Tory successes were certainly not the reason, neither were Labour Party divisions. Whilst they did go some way to ensuring that the Tories remained in power, the economic boom on a global scale enabled the Tories to foster the affluent society with ease. The party became associated with affluence, and so grew its majority further because affluence was desired by all.Therefore, the main reason for Tory domination during this period was the global situation which the tories had been placed into.
