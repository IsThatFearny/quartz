# Exam Question - June 2022 25 Marks Emancipation


#### ‘By 1881, the emancipation of the serfs had brought profound social change in Russia.’ Assess the validity of this view. 

The 1861 emancipation edict, in theory, freed all privately-owned serfs from their landowners, and in 1863, the emancipation of state-owned serfs marked an end to serfdom in Russia altogether. However, despite social change being the intention behind emancipation, it is questionable as to whether this had actually occurred by 1881. In this essay, I shall endeavour to argue that very little social change, a far cry from profound, had taken place by 1881. I shall compare the conditions of ex-serfs and the peasantry between 1861 and 1881, analyse change in the class structure of Russia, and explore the further reforms that took place as a result of emancipation, in order to argue that social change was not, in fact, profound.

The conditions of serfs in 1861 can be defined in a single word: impoverished. All crop yields had to be surrendered to the landlord to be redistributed, with those who worked to grow the crops getting the smallest portion. Serfs lived in poorly built homes, with no land for themselves, tied to the land and therefore the landowner. A lack of industry in Russia meant that there was little way to further themselves, and serfs and peasants were limited to cottage industry. Living in effective slavery, the serfs were in poverty and had very low life-expectancies. Emancipation, it might be assumed, would remedy this. However, this was not the case. By 1881, ex-serfs, now regular peasants, remained tied to the mir and to the land that they lived on, through redemption payments. These payments, made for 49 years, were to be sued as compensation for the landowners losing their free labour, and this inadvertently ensured that the peasants were not able to better themselves due to this financial burden. Along with heavy indirect taxation, this limited social change significantly. Further to this, the land allocated to the peasants was often too small to be viable farmland, and the distribution was disproportional. Landowners still owned two thirds of the land, whilst peasants only got one third, despite making up over 80% of the population. By 1881, the majority of land was strip farmed due to the small size of these plots. This meant that 50% of peasants could not grow sufficient crops to feed themselves, let alone trade and earn income from. A lack of sufficient income prevented social mobility, and peasants could not better themselves, thus remaining poor. The only way that a peasant could hope to make a decent living was through industry. Peasants were encouraged to move to industrial centres, but due to their attachment to the mir, many were unable to. Those that were able to (by 1881, this was only 2% of the population) found that the industrial revolution had not yet reached Russia. Living conditions were squalid, and pay was little better than it had been in the countryside. By 1881, peasants remained living in squalor, earning very little and unable to participate in industry. They were tied to the land, if not the landowners, and were usually unable to leave. This bears a striking resemblance to the situation of the serfs in 1861, and therefore from this we can conclude that profound social change was not achieved for the peasantry.

The class system in Russia was rigid in 1861. The Tsar and the aristocracy were at the top of the pyramid. The middle class (what little there was) were below this, the peasantry even further down, and serfs at the very bottom. One might think that emancipation would change this, for all classes, causing the divide between the rich and the poor to be decreased. However, this did not occur. As discussed previously, 50% of peasants were unable to make a profit from industry or from agriculture, and so they remained at the bottom of the social order. The middle class in 1861 was very small, and it remained as such in 1881, increasing by only a small amount. This increase is accounted for by Kulaks, or prosperous peasants. These were peasants that had been lucky and been allocated a relatively large plot of land, and had succeeded in working their way up the ladder through capitalist ventures. However, Kulaks made up less than 1% of the population, and so this is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. The aristocracy remained rich, with the landowners receiving the benefit of redemption payments and retaining two thirds of the land. By 1881, the social order looked very similar to how it had looked in 1861, and very little social change had occurred in this respect.

It may be argued that profound social change *did* occur as a result of the reforms that accompanied serfdom, however even this change was limited. Local government, military, and judiciary reforms were all introduced. The zemstvo was established as a devolved local government for rural areas, giving towns and villages more autonomy. Whilst this did allow peasants to make their voices heard to an extent, the zemstvo was dominated by the nobility, and therefore peasants had little influence in reality. The same is true for the judicial system, whose judges were almost always nobles, and therefore unfair verdicts were reached in the trials of peasants. This meant that these reforms were incapable of having the intended impact of profound social change. Military reforms had a similar effect (that is, very little). Reducing conscription from 25 to 15 years (with 10 years in the reserves) and allowing conscripts to live outside a military commune did have some effect on the prosperity of peasants, but this was again limited. These reforms, whilst in theory they should have brought about social change, in actuality had very little effect on changing the social order within Russia. By 1881, the political and economic standings of Russian groups had barely changed.

In conclusion, the view that by 1881, the emancipation of the serfs had brought profound social change in Russia is an invalid one. Emancipation in fact brought about very little change. 15% of peasants remained temporarily obligated to their landlords by 1881, most, if not all, paid redemption payments, and lived in squalor. The social order had not changed, save for a tiny increase in the middle class, and reforms that were intended to bring about this profound change did not have the intended effect. Therefore, ‘profound’ social change is a far cry from the state of Russia by 1881.
