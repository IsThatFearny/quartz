# Initial Coursework Resource Task

### 1) What qualities did Thomas Clarkson, William Wilberforce, and Granville Sharp possess?

Clarkson was an ‘inspired organiser’, Wilberforce was a widely respected parliamentarian, and Sharp was the ‘venerable father figure’. These were a formidable trio, but lacked a great intellect to bind them together.

<br>

### 2) Can you explain why these qualities might have been very important to the abolitionist cause?

Clarkson’s organisation was vital to the cause because the movement required coordination throughout the country, and this was a difficult task for someone less adept. The respect that Wilberforce commanded and his role as an MP allowed him to have significant influence in parliament and government, and this allowed the abolitionist caused to be brought to the forefront of politics of the day. The ‘venerable father figure’ of Sharp gave the cause sturdy backing and legitimacy.

<br>

### 3) What was ‘frankpledge’ - is it relevant to your enquiry? Why might it give us some sort of insight into Granville Sharp’s personality?

‘Frankpledge’ was a system of mutual responsibility, mainly for the unfree and landless men, in which a group of 10-12 men would be responsible for keeping the peace, i.e. bringing each other to justice. This is how Sharp assumed ‘african law’ worked. This may show that Sharp was uneducated about the customs of African countries.

<br>

### Why was James Stephen such an important addition to the abolitionist circle?

Stephen was an intellectual and a strategist for the abolitionist movement, something that had been sorely lacked before hand. Stephen had a driving hatred for slavery, having lived in the West Indies for a decade.

<br>

### What crucial tool did he possess in the fight for abolition?

Stephen was a leading maritime lawyer, and he helped work on bills that would end the slave trade by using maritime law.

<br>

### What did Stephens write about in *The Crisis of the Sugar Colonies*?

Stephen wrote about how the St. Domingue revolution was a warning, and that slavery would soon prove to be a large drain on the economy and national resources. He put forward the economic damages, rather than his own moral stance on the subject.

<br>

### The St. Domingue Revolution was clearly very significant… How can you quickly find out about its significance?

There is significant reference to it in the index, including subcategories. We can use these pages to find out about individual parts of the revolution, and piece together the reason for its significance.

<br>

### Why was the slave revolt on St Domingue rather more than a slave uprising?

The revolt was the only one of its kind to succeed in its aim. The slaves on the island overthrew their enslavers and took full control of the plantations and the land on the island. This was a full scale revolution, rather than an uprising. It served as a warning to Britain of the danger of mistreating slaves.

<br>

### Why did the British get involved?

Britain believed that their involvement would allow them to conquer the island, removing it from french hands, and gain large amounts of land and plantations. Further, they wished to stop the slave rebellion from spreading for fear that the slaves on their colonies would become agitated.

<br>

### How did James Stephens use the events on St. Domingue as an argument for abolition in the context of the ongoing war with France?

Stephen argued that neutral ships should be able to be seized, so that France and her allies could not supply their colonies. In reality, the cargo of these ships would be slaves and their seizure would help to end the slave trade (because most neutral or American ships were manned by British crews), but this real intent was kept hidden.

<br>
### How significant was this war? Was it a short-lived struggle? How might the war and the events on St. Domingue have been used by the opponents of abolition?

This war was of great importance, and it had been raging for over a decade. It was certainly not a short lived struggle. Opponents of abolition may have argued that the economic benefits that the slave trade brought were far too valuable to the war effort to give up, and so the slave trade should continue. Additionally, they might have argued that ending slavery would give rise to another full scale revolution on other British colonies, and this loss of territory would be very damaging to the empire.

<br>

### On pp. 302, there is a reference to another of Stephen’s books: ‘War in Disguise’ or ‘The Frauds of Neutral Flags’. What was Stephen warning his fellow MPs and countrymen about in this book?

He warned them about how so-called ‘neutral’ ships in the war were continuing to provide support, supplies, and slaves to French colonies, and that this practise must be stopped in order to bring the war to an end.

<br>

### Why was Stephen very careful not to refer to the specific fact that French colonies were continuing to benefit from the supply of slaves? What was he working towards?

Stephen made sure not to mention slavery, as it may have been seen as an abolitionist view and therefore rejected by many. Stephen was of course working towards abolition, more specifically at this time the ‘Foreign Slave Trade Act’.

<br>

### Why was William Wilberforce’s planned attempt to introduce another abolition bill in early 1806 ‘doomed’? Why would a time of war be a bad time to propose this?

It was the widely accepted view that slavery was necessary for the British economy. Much of the profits made from slavery went towards the war effort, and so the idea losing these funds would be a very unpopular view amongst parliament. 

<br>

### How many attempts had Wilberforce made to push abolition bills through Parliament before 1806? What was he looking to abolish? Why this and not just slavery itself?

Wilberforce had made 8 previous attempts. He was looking to abolish the slave trade. He chose to fight for this instead of the abolition of slavery because the abolition of slavery would be such a large event that it would severely damage the British economy, and so slavery would have to be gradually phased out.

<br>
### Can you explain what Stephens’ act of genius was in 1806?

Stephens proposed that a bill be put forward that advocated for the ending of the slave trade to French colonies by British ships. This ensured that the ‘neutral ships’ that had in fact been outfitted in Britain and were responsible for ⅔ of the slave trade were prevented from trading. This significantly downsized the slave trade.

<br>

### What did the Foreign Slave Trade Act logically lead into?

The act logically lead to a debate over the full abolition of the slave trade.

<br>

### Who was the Duke of Clarence? Which powerful British institution was clearly a formidable obstacle in the way of the abolitionists?

The Duke of Clarence was the brother of the King (who would later ascend to the throne). The royal family stood in the way of abolition, as they reaped the rewards more than most.

<br>

### Which industry petitioned against the abolitionists and why? How did Clarkson respond?

The cloth mill industry petitioned against it, as they felt that this may curtail the amount of cotton sent from America. Clarkson circulated a counter-petition which got more signatures than the original petition.

<br>

### Was Wilberforce’s 1807 attempt doomed to failure as well?

No, because he now had parliamentary support and the support of public opinion. However, his 1807 attempt did not go as far as emancipation, and that would have to wait for three decades to be realised.
