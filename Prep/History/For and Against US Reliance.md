# For and Against US Reliance

</br>

## For:

- Suez crisis: had to pull out due to lack of US support - Eisenhower threatened that he wouldn't support the pound if Britain continued the fighting.

- Nuclear deterrent: Britain's nuclear capabilities were mostly reliant upon the US (after the failure of Blue Streak Britain had to rely on Skybolt, which was subsequently cancelled too). The Polaris submarines, whilst giving Britain relative independence, were still maintained and ultimately controlled by the USA.

- US loans propped up Britain's economy, and ultimately the Americans controlled the interest paid on these loans and the conditions of them.

- Britain relied on the US to give it a foothold to climb to the 'top table'

- With the US being such big part of NATO both financially and militarily, Britain, along with the rest of western Europe, relied upon the US for defence and support in the event of military action.
