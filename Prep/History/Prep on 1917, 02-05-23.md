#### Ordered chronologically:

**Brusilov Offensive:** The largest offensive of WWI. Russia decimated Austria-Hungary’s forces, but suffered heavy casualties itself. **How this made revolution more likely:** Caused widespread discontent with how the war was being run, and outcry over the heavy costs that Russia was facing

**Peasant grievances by 1917:** Unequal distribution of land, lack of political equality, poor harvest, famine. **How this made revolution more likely:** Peasants started to seize land from landowners, and had a negative view of the government

**Soldier’s grievances by 1917:** High casualties from war, poor living conditions, hunger, freezing cold, long offensives, poor organisation. **How this made revolution more likely:** A government cannot be successful without control of its army, and the high numbers of desertions meant that the Russian government was losing all of its control over its population.

**Worker’s grievances by 1917**: Long hours for little pay, poor working conditions, lack of workers rights. **How this made revolution more likely:** Workers went on strike, and their discontent with the government grew. They became loyal to the Petrograd Soviet.

**Provisional Government:** Elected committee made up of 12 members, chosen by the Duma. Intended to be an interim government that would run the country until democratic elections could take place. **How this made revolution more likely:** Provisional government had little mandate, and no control over workers or soldiers. Their ineffectiveness at making decisions due to their interim nature caused people to decide that they were too incompetent to lead.

**Petrograd Soviet:** An elected group who represented the views of the working class and soldiers. **How this made revolution more likely:** The Soviet had to approve all PG decisions, and had a large contingent of revolutionaries within it. This gave them a voice and the power to make decisions.

**Dual Power:** The power sharing arrangement of the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet. Order No. 1 gave the soviet the power to veto any Provisional Government decisions, in practise. **How this made revolution more likely:** Power sharing meant that Provisional Government decisions had to be approved by the Petrograd Soviet. This often meant that decisions were made slowly or not at all, and people became discontented with this.

**Bolshevik Theory/Leninism**: The political ideology that an undeveloped country such as Russia was able to skip the stages to communism proposed by Marx, and progress straight to socialism. This would be done with a small group of highly-trained revolutionaries carrying out a coup. **How this made revolution more likely:** This was eventually the way in which the Bolsheviks took power in the October revolution, and so was a major factor in the revolution.

**April Theses:** Lenin’s speeches in Petrograd written down. They advocated for Leninism and revolution against the Provisional Government. **How this made revolution more likely:** The April Theses were widely read, and Bolshevik ideas were spread in their reading. 

**July Days:** A series of street riots in July 1917, with workers and peasants protesting against the government’s handling of the war and of land redistribution.
**How this made revolution more likely:** The lack of action after these riots caused even more discontent and distrust in the government.

**Kornilov:** General of the Russian armed forces. Aimed to destroy the Petrograd Soviet and to install a military dictatorship. Attempted a coup, but was stopped by Bolshevik Red Guard. **How this made revolution more likely:** Imprisoned Bolsheviks, such as Trotsky, were now released and had been armed by Kerensky. They were hailed as the heroes of Petrograd, and were given much more legitimacy as a party.
