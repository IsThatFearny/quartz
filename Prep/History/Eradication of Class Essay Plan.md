‘Eradicating class’ is defined here as the removal of all hierarchy based on economic and social status, including gender, race, and religious discrimination

### LOE 1: Yes, the Bolsheviks did eradicate class: Lenin and Stalin’s policies

- Official abolition of class hierarchy in November 1917
- Titles and privileges removed, all people became ‘citizens’, party members became comrades
- Bourgeoisie prevented from working, apart from menial tasks such as road-sweeping, and had houses taken away. Rationing was also based on class
- Women given the same educational rights as men, divorce made easier and less expensive, abortion legalised in 1920. 43% of the workforce was female by 1940
- Church land was seized in 1917, and schools/seminaries were taken over by the state
- Official separation of church and state in 1918
- Stalin criminalised the publication of ‘religious propaganda’ in 1936
- Similar religious effects were had on muslims
- Self-determination promised in Nov. 1917 for national minorities
- National minorities given separate representation within the party
- Jews were treated equally: Yiddish an acceptable language from 1917
- ‘Liquidation of Kulaks as a class’ - dekulakisation removed prosperous peasants from the population, removing this subdivision of class hierarchy

### LOE 2: No, the Bolsheviks did not eradicate class: Lenin’s policies

- NEP marked a reprieve in the class battle: rise of NEPmen and bourgeois specialists
- Lenin was relatively lenient on the church and religion - Marx called it the ‘opium of the people’ - and so the abolition of religious class was not fully realised
- Women, whilst legally equal, were not actually equal - most found it very difficult to balance their working responsibilities and family life

### LOE 3: No, the Bolsheviks did not eradicate class: Stalin’s policies

- ‘Proletarian elite’ created in the wake of the Stakhanovite movement: more moved to cities and towns and became managers
- Those in positions of important in parties and factories were able to obtain luxury goods, which were often out of reach of the proletariat
- Stalin reversed many of the reforms for women - large fees introduced in order to deter divorce, contraception banned, financial incentives offered for large families
- Stalin’s purges included the deportation of non-russians and the suppression of nationalist movements. In 1938, Russian became compulsory in all Soviet schools
