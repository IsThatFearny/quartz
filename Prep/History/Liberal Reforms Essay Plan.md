# Government under Wilson Essay Plan

</br>

## Liberal Reforms 

### Background

- Roy Jenkins - Home secretary 1965-67, Chancellor 1967-70, under Wilson. Created an environment in which MPs felt that they would be able to pass PMBs, by giving them enough time to be debated (most PMBs fail due to lack of time)
- Most reforms passed as PMBs, to avoid damaging the reputation of the government (none of these policies were in the Labour manifesto)
- Reforms such as Homosexuality, abortion, death penalty, etc. went against public opinion
- Votes on ethical issues were ‘free votes’, allowing MPs to vote as they wished without fear of repercussions from the whips.
- Jenkins sought to build the ‘civilised society’ - deemed ‘permissive’ by many critics
- Labour was quite conservative at this time, especially James Callaghan who succeeded Jenkins as home secretary

### Reforms

#### Death Penalty

Death penalty was abolished under Jenkins, but the process was begun by his Tory predecessor, and so he was not directly responsible for this. It contravened public opinion, and so Labour did not use it in their manifesto for fear of losing support.

#### Homosexuality

The 1957 Wolfenden report made recommendations that homosexuals should be allowed to perform homosexual acts in private. This resulted in the 1967 sexual offences act, which made homosexual acts between consenting adults (over 21s) in private legal. As with the death penalty, this was not backed by the public, and so was introduced as a PMB by several MPs, among them Leo Abse. This was not full equality, as the minimum age for homosexual relations was higher than for heterosexual ones.

#### Education

Labour attempted to replace the tripartite system (11+ determined whether a child went to a Technical College, Secondary Modern, or Grammar school). A letter was circulated by Anthony Crossland (Circular 10/65), requesting all Local Education Authorities (LEAs) to convert to the comprehensive system. This system was said to allow for fairer education, with pupils being taught according to their abilities, instead of filtering those who weren’t academically inclined into schools that gave them fewer opportunities. The majority of LEAs responded to this request, and comprehensives became much more common across the country. In addition to this, Wilson started the Open University, which opened up education for many who could not afford a traditional higher education.

#### Abortion

Abortion was also legalised during this period. The Abortion Act of 1967 was introduced by David Steele, a 29-year old Labour MP (the youngest in the house) as a PMB. The act allowed women to have an abortion after the approval of two doctors, with a wide number of reasons. Critics said that the number of abortions rose significantly after this act was passed, however this is only a reflection of the numbers that had previously been hidden due to underground abortion clinics. This act furthered women’s rights significantly, and went hand-in-hand with the divorce act in giving women more personal freedom.

#### Divorce

The 1969 Divorce Act allowed divorces to occur when both parties had been living apart for two years and were in agreement, or, if only one party wished for the divorce to happen, the period apart would be extended to five years. It also permitted no-fault divorces, where neither party was considered to be at fault, and there was no burden of proof (especially on the woman in the divorce). Along with the abortion act, this gave a boost to women’s rights, and allowed those in abusive or unhappy relationships to leave more easily. Critics said that this was too permissive, and that it would make marriage less sacred. Indeed, divorce rates did rise (they were bound to), but not as much as predicted.

### Permissive vs Civilised

Jenkins considered the society that he had nurtured to be ‘civilised’, allowing more personal freedom and freedom of expression. This certainly contributed to the idea of the ‘swinging 60s’. However, the government was criticised for having instead created a ‘permissive’ society, which allowed too much personal freedom. Critics said that the laws that had been introduced would only serve to increase promiscuity and the ‘drugs, sex, and rock and roll’ culture that had started to grow in recent years. Jenkins refuted this, saying that allowing more personal freedom and being progressive was not ‘permissive’, but indeed ‘civilised’, and restricting personal freedom would have been a step in the wrong direction.

## Economy

Wilson’s Labour government made significant changes to the economy. Their key achievement  was bringing the budget back into surplus. However, they became unpopular after devaluing the pound, the very thing that they had promised not to do. James Callaghan was replaced as the Chancellor of the Exchequer by Roy Jenkins in a department swap to avoid sullying his reputation further. Jenkins brought in a series of tough budgets with higher taxes. He said that the country needed ‘two years of hard graft’ to revive its former greatness. Wilson pitted Callaghan as Chancellor against George Brown as chairman of the DEA. The two roles had significant overlap, and so they were working against each other. Wilson did this in order to weaken them as his opponents to the Labour leadership.
