# Unemployment 15 Marker

</br>

Low unemployment/full employment is a key macroeconomic objective for almost all governments, and is usually looked upon as an indicator that the economy is doing well. Unemployment has a myriad of benefits, such as increased aggregate demand (because more people are in jobs, they have a higher propensity to spend as they are earning more money), which promotes economic growth. 

However, the main reason that governments seek to achieve full employment is the costs that come with high unemployment. For example, if unemployment is high, full productive potential is not reached, as the economy is not employing its factors of production (in this case, labour) fully. This will create a negative output gap, slowing economic growth significantly. In addition to this, in countries with generous welfare systems, an increase in unemployment causes an increase in government spending on benefits and services for those without a job, and to further exacerbate this, governments will receive lower revenue from taxes. This will increase government borrowing. Also, high unemployment can cause social issues such as crime and vandalism, which again requires the government to step in and spend money to solve these issues.

Some types of unemployment are worse than others, and we can therefore afford higher levels of the 'right' type of unemployment. Frictional unemployment is considered a 'better' type of unemployment, as it occurs when people leave their jobs to look for new ones (parents returning to the labour force and newly graduated students are also included in this category). This type of unemployment is often relatively transitional, and therefore causes little issue in the economy. This is in direct contrast with long-term unemployment, which occurs when an individual has been searching for a job for over 12 months. This can be caused by other types of unemployment such as seasonal, frictional or cyclical, and is often hard to break out of. This type of unemployment is more permanent and harder for governments to solve, and can therefore be an issue in the economy. Keeping unemployment low allows for long-term unemployment to be kept to a minimum, thus causing less of a problem for the government.
