# Economic Growth

</br>

## Why does the government want to achieve high economic growth?

Higher economic growth has a positive impact on firms, consumers and economic outcomes. It tends to result in higher standards of living, higher incomes, and lower unemployment, and makes people feel better off.
</br>

## What are the main benefits of economic growth?

The main benefits of economic growth include higher standards of living, higher happiness, higher incomes, low unemployment, low inflation, increased levels of consumption, easier redistribution of wealth, lower crime rates, and less environmental damage.
</br>

## What are some of the costs of economic growth?

It may just result in extra demands instead of higher happiness, which may not actually increase utility. In addition, as society becomes more industrious, social issues are likely to increase, as are mental health problems. Society becomes materialistic, and growth may have a negative impact on the environment due to a higher level of consumption (and therefore maximisation of profits, where environmentally friendly methods may not always be preferable)
</br>

## What is the difference between 'actual growth' and 'potential growth'?

During actual growth, the economy produces more. Instead of there being an increase in capacity, factors of production are employed to a fuller extent. Actual growth tends to be a good short-term measure of economic growth. In contrast, potential growth is much more long term, as the economy is increasing how much it can produce (LRAS). It shows how much potential to grow an economy has.
</br>

## How can actual economic growth be achieved?

Actual economic growth can be achieved through increased consumption or increased supply, rises in consumer confidence, reductions in imports and increases in exports, etc.
</br>

## How can potential economic growth be achieved?

Potential economic growth can be achieved through methods such as increasing investment on capital, encouraging migration, increasing productivity, and through technological developments.
