### Measures of Unemployment

#### Labour Force Survey

Survey conducted by the ONS which determines the amount of employed, unemployed and economically inactive. Unemployment rate is calculated by the formula: $$\text{Unemployment Rate} = \frac{\text{Unemployed}}{\text{Economically Active}} \times 100$$
However, costs a lot of money and can be inaccurate and subject to sampling bias.

#### Claimant Count

The amount of people that claim unemployment benefits from the government. However, can be inaccurate, because not all unemployed people claim benefits, and the system could be subject to fraud.

### Production Possibility Frontier

A PPF contrasts the opportunity costs between two products (i.e. the amount of one good sacrificed in order to make one more unit of the other good). PPF will shift outwards if there is an increase in the LRAS of the economy (more productive potential), and vice versa. When an economy is operating *on* the PPF, then it is operating at full capacity and full efficiency. If it is operating at a point inside the curve, the economy is operating with spare capacity.

### Consequences of Economic Growth

#### Benefits

- More disposable income
- Higher employment
- Higher profits for firms
- Increase in tax revenues (due to higher incomes and profits)

#### Costs

- Can increase inflation
- Can cause income inequality (i.e. the rich get richer)
- Has environmental costs
- May increase current account deficit

#### Evaluation

When evaluating, we must take into account: whether the growth is sustainable; whether it is inclusive; whether it is balanced; and the role that the government/private sector have to play
