### Economic Integration

#### What does it mean?

Economic integration is the process by which economic relationships between countries deepen over time, i.e. free-trade areas, customs union, single market, monetary union e.g. the European Union
#### Impact - how does this support growth?

Countries are able to specialise and trade without government interference. It also leads to a reduction in the cost of trade, improved availability of goods and services and more choice of these, and gains in efficiency, leading to greater purchasing power. Employment opportunities improve, and technology sharing, market expansion, and FDI increase and therefore promote growth. Additionally, economic ties between countries reduces political tensions and increases stability

### Import Substitution

#### What does it mean?

Import substitution is effectively protectionism, where newly formed domestic industries are protected from foreign intervention to allow the full development of domestic industries. This reduces import dependency. 
#### Impact - how does this support growth?

Domestic industry flourishes, meaning higher exports and a better standard of living, as well as an improvement in the current account balance. Additionally, it increases trade independence. Domestic industry growth also improves employment opportunities.

#### Diagram

The diagram below demonstrates the decrease in imports as a result of protectionist policy (in this case, tariffs).

### Diversification of the Economy
#### What does it mean?

Diversification of the economy is the expansion of the economy to involve different markets, e.g. developing a fledgling industry which had previously not been present in the economy
