# Falling unemployment trade offs 25 marks
</br>

Reducing unemployment is a primary macroeconomic objective. Measured either by the Labour Force Survey or the claimant count, unemployment is the number of people that are out of work, but are still economically active (i.e. looking for a job). However, in reducing unemployment, governments have to face trade-offs with other primary objectives - that is, as one unemployment falls, another objective is negatively affected. The primary objectives that are generally affected are: inflation, the general rise in price level; and balance of payments, the net exports of a country

In the UK, the government attempts to keep inflation at a steady 2%. However, falling unemployment often causes the rate of inflation to rise significantly. As unemployment falls, people who have found jobs earn more money (more money, at least, than they were getting on unemployment benefits). This increase in the proportion of disposable income causes consumption to rise, as people spend more money. Because consumption is a component of Aggregate Demand (AD), AD shifts to the right. This causes not only an increase in output, but also a rise in the general price level and thus an increase in the rate of inflation. The diagram below demonstrates this. The rate of inflation is originally at P1, but increases to P2 after a rightward shift in AD. Additionally, the below Phillips curve demonstrates the relationship between unemployment and inflation. As seen in the diagram, as the employment rate increases, so does inflation. However, it is not a given that inflation will automatically increase. In the event that supply-side policy was implemented to shift the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve outwards, then the price level would remain the same, as seen in the below AD/AS diagram. Additionally, external factors such as lower wage rates and lower prices of commodities may have this effect. It is not, therefore, inevitable that inflation will increase as employment falls.

Additionally, falling unemployment will also cause the trade deficit to worsen. As previously stated, falling unemployment increases consumption due to the larger amount of disposable income available. When incomes rise, people tend to import more goods, as they are now able to pay the higher price (the price is higher due to import tariffs, transport costs, etc.). This causes the trade deficit to increase (or the trade surplus to decrease). In some cases, a trade-deficit can be a good thing. But governments tend to aim towards reducing the trade deficit, and so an increase is worrying. The effect of falling employment on the current account deficit is dependent upon multiple other factors, however. If lower unemployment is the result of successful supply side policy, then the effect on the balance of payments will be minimised or neutralised. Also, export sales might grow due to a depreciation of the exchange rate. This can be seen in the AD/AS diagram above. Therefore, as before, falling unemployment does not entirely compromise the ability of a government to reach other macroeconomic objectives.

Therefore, with the correct policy implemented, or the right circumstances, it is not inevitable that falling unemployment leads to negative consequences in terms of other macroeconomic objectives.
