Inflation: A persistent increase of prices annually in an economy

#### CPI determination

To determine the CPI, a survey is carried out enquiring about expenditure per household on a ‘basket’ of commonly bought goods (updated annually), and the average price of said goods is determined. The prices of these goods are then weighted based on the percentage of income that is spent on them. These weighted prices are added together, giving the total weighted price of the basket. A base year is then selected, and given the base index value of 100. The weighted prices are converted into index numbers, and percentage change calculations done to calculate annual inflation.

#### Flaws with the CPI

- Personal inflation rates differ, as the ‘average family’ is not exactly representative
- Certain goods are very volatile in price, such as food or energy
- Housing costs are not taken into account
- The CPI is updated too rarely to be of great use
