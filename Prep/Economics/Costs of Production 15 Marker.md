# Costs of Production 15 Marker


#### ‘The law of diminishing returns is an economic principle which will definitely operate at some point, whereas economies of scale are less certain.’

#### Explain how a firm’s costs of production may be affected by diminishing returns in the short run and economies of scale in the long run.

The law of diminishing returns is the principle that as a variable factor of production is increased past a certain point, the extra benefit gained from each unit of that factor decreases. For example, if profit is increased by £5 when labour is increased from one worker to two, when labour  is increased from two workers to three, this additional profit will decrease, say to £4. Economies of scale are benefits gained from growing and investing in a company. This may come in the form of specialisation, managerial, marketing, financial, and so on.

In the short run, a firm’s costs of production will be affected by the law of diminishing returns. If a firm were to increase the amount of workers hired (labour), then this would provide benefits, but only up to a certain point. Once this point is reached, marginal returns begin to decrease. In the case of labour, this may be because the workers are getting in each other’s way, or there is not enough capital for all workers. This will only occur in the short run, when one factor of production is fixed (such as capital). This may mean that average cost will be increased past the point of diminishing returns, because for every labour input, the change in output is relatively smaller. The cost required to hire an extra worker (because of wages and similar costs) is greater than the profit gained from hiring said worker. Therefore, because average cost = total cost/output, average costs will increase per worker hired past the point of diminishing returns. This remains true for all other factors of production, as long as one remains fixed (in the short run).

In the long run, a firm’s costs of production will be affected by economies of scale. As a firm increases in size, economies of scale may benefit them. For example, a larger firm may be able to: gain more favourable interest rates on loans, therefore reducing the cost of investment; specialise further and become more productively efficient as a result; introduce more effective marketing campaigns on a larger scale, thus bringing in more consumers; or divide labour and hire managers in order to increase efficiency. All of these examples of economies of scale only apply in the long run, because all factors of production are variable. Average cost is decreased, because efficiency of the firm is increased. A better marketing campaign may lead to increased profits, more investment in capital (made possible by more favourable loan interest rates) will increase productive efficiency and perhaps decrease wages (as jobs are cut due to replacement by machines). These examples demonstrate how average costs can be kept down by increasing the size of a firm and therefore increasing productive efficiency.

The diagram below demonstrates the effect of economies of scale upon a firm in the long run. The lowest point of the LRAC is the point of productive efficiency at which a firm should be operating, taking maximum advantage of economies of scale whilst not being disadvantaged by diseconomies of scale. C1 is the lowest possible long run costs, and Q1 is the productively efficient output level.
