Derived Demand: Demand that is caused by demand for something else, e.g. the demand for bricks stems from the demand for houses

Composite Demand: One thing is demanded for multiple purposes, e.g. milk is demanded for making many different dairy products

Joint Demand: Aka Compliments. Two goods work together to provide an outcome to the consumer.

Joint Supply: One good is a by-product of demand for another good, e.g. cow-hide and beef

### Negative Production Externalities

A negative externality in production occurs when the production of a good has a third-party effect, such as pollution, deforestation, etc.

It occurs when Marginal Social Cost outweighs Marginal Private Cost, and is caused by self-interest, information failure, or a misallocation of resources.
