### Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West

- 131 textual items translated from Arabic to Latin (pg. 2)
- Influence is ‘particularly dominant in natural philosophy’  and strong in the 13th century (pg. 2)
- Latin philosophers took the ideas of the ‘four qualities…the circular movement of the heavenly spheres’ and ‘[used] Aristotelian concepts such as matter and form,. action and passion, cause and effect’ (pg. 5-6)
- ‘School of chartres’ ‘drew amply on the new medical and astrological sources’ (pg. 5)
- Look at *Philisophia* (William of Conches) and *De natura corporis et animae* (William of St.-Thierry)
- Avicenna and Averroes important in later middle ages (Averroes specifically influenced Aquinas, yet some of his theology bears a striking resemblance to atheism - look at impacts on western religion?)
