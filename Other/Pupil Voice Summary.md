# Pupil Voice Summary

</br>

**(Will)** Testing, SCAs & PRs, Feedback – lower stakes (pupils feel they engage further when they feel a sense of competency), spaced out, revision checklists. Can departments narrow down and focus the SCA revision list as it is unmanageable to revise swathes of content for just one lesson SCA. Departments coordinate CW/SCA clashes? Pupils are clear they wish teachers to provide feedback on more than just final tests each term, such as contributions in lessons, prep-effort… – comments are welcomed for improvement.

- Students feel that they engage with the content more if they feel competent at it - they feel more motivated to learn further and to learn from mistakes if they did better in a test. Perhaps tests and SCAs need to have lower stakes in order for students to feel confident in their ability? Of course, leave some scope for furthering themselves (e.g. those who are more inclined to learn already), but adjust for others

- Key point that was made was stress: sometimes pupils feel that tests are too close together/not spaced out enough, e.g. we are often told that ‘SCA season is coming up’ - tests in multiple subjects in a similar time frame stresses students out. Coordination between departments for SCA and tests would be useful for pupils, the same applies to coursework deadlines, which can feel overwhelming if added on top of SCA revision and prep. Feedback related to this is that revision checklists are unmanageable. Pupils find that not only are they revising for multiple tests at a time, but this workload is exacerbated by a wide range of content to revise. Pupils like revision checklists, but these need to be condensed to a manageable level. 

- Pupils agree and are clear upon wanting feedback from teachers that isn’t simply limited to end of topic tests - contributions in lessons, prep feedback, etc. Probably not helped by the lack of comments on regular Prs… In person feedback is desired, pupils want to improve and sometimes feel that they lack a clear direction in which to work, regular pupil-teacher conversations would be welcomed for all, not just those who are perhaps struggling.
