# Eliminative Materialism

MBTIT is a form of ontological reduction - it says that mental states are brain states (reduces one to the other), just as ‘water = H<sub>2</sub>0’ reduces water to a chemical compound but does not say that water does not exist. 

Eliminative materialism, on the other hand, eliminates talk of mental states, it is not just reduction. Mental states can be explained in terms of brain states and so all talk of them can be eliminated entirely, e.g. to talk of ‘fear’ or ‘desire’ is meaningless, since they do not exist.

For example, we used to believe that heat was held and transferred through *caloric fluid*. We now know that this is not the case. We therefore no longer talk about caloric fluid - we have eliminated all talk of it. Eventually, neuroscience will show that mental states are like caloric fluid - outdated and ready to be eliminated. 

### Folk Psychology

> [!note] Folk Psychology
> Our explanation of behaviours with reference to mental states, e.g. Mima is smiling so Mima is feeling happy

Paul Churchland says that folk psychology is to neuroscience, what caloric fluid is to thermodynamics - something which can be eliminated from our understanding.

Folk psychology cannot explain many aspects of mental life, e.g. mental illness. These areas are explained through physical states - Folk Psychology does not have the necessary concepts.

Further, Folk Psychology has not made progress, whereas neuroscience has.

Folk Psychology does not fit with other scientific knowledge (largely because it claims that mental states have intentionality)

#### Criticisms of Eliminative Materialism

##### Certainty about the existence of mental states

Descartes argues that ‘I think’ is the first thing we can be certain about, i.e. our mental life is something that we are certain of/know intuitively. Therefore, no argument can be strong enough to justify giving up such self-evident belief - we know about mental states through reason and reflection. 

Response 1: Appeals to the most intuitive/obvious answer are not always successful, e.g. it seems obvious that the earth is flat. See also: [[Reason as a source of knowledge#Empiricist responses| Hume’s criticisms of Descartes’ Cogito]]

Response 2: Eliminative Materialism does not deny that there are psychological phenomenon, but it does deny that our usual way of talking about them is the wrong one. As neuroscience develops, we will be able to replace folk psychology explanations with scientific ones. 

##### Folk Psychology has good predictive + explanatory powers

Folk psychology explains motivations, feelings, etc. in a way that neuroscience cannot, e.g. “why did you go to the cinema?” is answered by appealing to folk psychology concepts such as desire. Further, folk psychology forms the basis of much scientific psychology, and is part of its development, e.g. appeals to unconscious bias, or upbringing. 

Churchland is wrong to dismiss folk psychology as something that doesn’t make progress, and to eliminate folk psychology would be to eliminate much of scientific psychology. Intentionality remains the best hypothesis for our mental experiences.

Response 1: We need to know how human actions relate to mental life. There are too many theories currently trying to explain this.

Response 2: Developments are superficial - explanations for human behaviour, etc. are less powerful than neuroscientific ones.

Response 3: Folk psychology cannot explain how physical states can have intentionality.

##### Eliminative Materialism is self-refuting

Eliminative Materialism is expressing a belief about mental states (or lack thereof), yet it states that there are no beliefs. So Eliminative Materialism is self-refuting.

Response: Eliminative Materialism’s aim is to develop a new, scientific understanding of beliefs - they are *not* claiming that beliefs are a special property or have independent existence.

Counter-response: Eliminative Materialists claim they can/will eliminate intentional content/mental states but do not seem able to replace it with anything else. They cannot explain mental states, especially intentionality, as evidenced by the fact that its own theory relies on intentional mental states (beliefs) in its expression. Eliminative Materialism seems to fall short of genuine elimination.

Eliminative Materialism claims that intentional content cannot be explained in physical terms and so should be eliminated. However, we could argue that the fact that it cannot be explained physically suggests that we should be looing for an alternative (dualist) explanation.
