# Further Issues with Substance Dualism

## Issues with Epiphenomenalist Substance Dualism

```ad-info
title: [[Philosophy/Glossary#Epiphenomenalist Substance Dualism|Epiphenomenalist Substance Dualism]]

The view that the mind has no causal powers and so does not cause physical events.
</br>
N.B. Epiphenomenal: The effect of a process, in this case mental states are the effect/by-product of physical states
```

If I physically experience pain, this triggers a mental state of the belief that I am in pain. This in turn affects the way I act physically. We do appear to experience mental states causing/affecting physical ones. Further, it is unclear how I can know about my own mind. I know about my mental states through introspection and because they cause other mental states. However, if epiphenomenalist is true then mental states cannot cause each other and cannot cause me to reflect (introspect) on the mental states I have.

Mental states can also cause other mental states, e.g. if I believe that the snake will bite me, this causes me to fear the snake.

## The Problem of Other Minds

```ad-info
title: Solipsism

This is the issue that, given that we only experience our own minds directly, we cannot know either the content or existence of other people’s minds.
```

For substance dualism, it is unclear how I can infer that other bodies have minds attached, as the mind is a separate substance to the body.

### Response: The argument from analogy

I know that my mental states cause behaviour, e.g. I fell angry, so I hit something. I can therefore assume/infer that other people’s behaviour, e.g. Mrs Fairley throwing something at David is caused by mental states as well.

However, this uses induction and is only based on one case, i.e. my own, singular experience. I could be the only one with a mind. Therefore we must reformulate this argument. Start with behaviours that have mental causes, e.g. hitting something has the mental cause of anger, give as many examples as possible. If others exhibit these behaviours, then it is likely that these behaviours have a mental cause. Therefore, other people have minds. 

However, not all behaviours have obvious mental causes or ones that I am aware of, e.g. reflexes are purely physical and not all effects have like causes.

### Best Hypothesis

The existence of other minds is the best hypothesis. The best explanation for behaviour is other minds. This is a better explanation than the suggestion that I am the only mind (solipsism). Mental states could be ‘inner’ states which are par of the physical and cause other states

#### Objections

1) Assumes that functionalism is the right account of mental states
2) We still need to understand how the mental can cause physical events
3) Belief in minds is not a hypothesis
