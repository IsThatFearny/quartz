# To what extent is Religious Language meaningful?

</br>





### Hare

Hare argues that religious language is meaningless as fact because it is non-cognitivist. Good because religion is a matter of faith rather than fact - ‘I believe in God’ rather than ‘God must exist’. It is, however, meaningful in terms of a world-view or attitude - a *blik*. One might lead a christian life because they view their faith as motivator or a system of beliefs, without experience to back up their assertion. They simply have faith.



Weaknesses:

- Flew argues that Hare’s *bliks* cannot properly account for religious language - if it is merely a worldview then it would have no impact or explanatory power; as well as this, believers intend their assertions to be understood cognitively, e.g. because they discuss the creation of the universe
- Both make good points, but ultimately Flew’s objections triumph over Hare’s theory, because claims like ‘do $x$ because it is God’s will’ becomes ‘do $x$’.

## Essay

### Is Religious Language meaningful?

**Intro:** cognitive vs non-cognitive approach and the implications of each for the meaning of religious language. Classical arguments for the existence of God assume cognitivism





**Line of argument:** Religious language is cognitive but meaningless

**Argument 1:** Flew - parable of the gardener; ‘God exists’ is cognitive and unfalsifiable so meaningless; (link to VP here)

**Argument 2:** Hick’s response - eschatological verification; religious language is verifiable/falsifiable in the next life

**Argument 3:** Evaluation: Hick’s response does not satisfactorily advance the argument; verification in the next life is vague + does not change the meaningfulness of religious language in this life

**Argument 4:** Mitchell offers a different way of looking at religious language from a cognitivist approach - partisan and stranger. Meaningful because believers are open to falsification

**Argument 5:** Flew’s response: the stranger and God are not analogous (anthropomorphises God) -  we cannot give the same allowances to God that we allow to the stranger. Religious claims are stronger than Mitchell suggests.

From point 5, depending on the line of argument, we have multiple options to choose from: - Hare’s bliks - religious language is non-cognitive; or Flew’s response; or we could move straight into a conclusion.
