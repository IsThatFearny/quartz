# Descartes’ Proof of the External World

</br>

Descartes’ argument progresses through 4 stages:

1) The concept of a physical object is known a priori
2) The concept of a physical object is coherent

</br>

Step 4: Physical objects do exist

1) Argument from imagination

- Imagination and understanding are different
- Imagination uses images, but understanding does not
- Imagination takes more effort
- Understanding is essential (I can’t be a thinking thing without understanding)

So imagination seems to depend on having a body (it draws from sense impressions), whereas understanding relies on reason alone. It is probable that the body exists (best hypothesis for my experience).

2) Argument from involuntary perceptions

Our perceptions are involuntary so cannot be caused by ourselves. They could be caused by God, but God is not a deceiver. So if it was God then he would have created us with the tendency to have false beliefs (i.e. that the physical world exists) and God would not do this. So the cause of our perceptions is physical objects themselves.

### Empiricist responses

- Direct Realism: We do not need to argue for the existence of the external world, since we are directly aware of it
- Synthetic propositions can only be known through inductive reasoning. Locke and Russel provide inductive arguments for the existence of the external world and this is as far as we can go (see Hume’s mitigated scepticism)
- Depends on arguments for God’s existence, so only works if those are successful
- Hume’s fork: As a claim about what exists, this is a matter of fact and so cannot be shown a prior (unlike analytic truths)
- Hume: the 2nd proof exists, when it is in fact merely a complex idea created from repeated experience of impressions/simple ideas
