# What is Philosophical Behaviourism? (Revised from Prep)

### What is the problem of other minds as faced by the dualist?

There can be no empirical evidence to test the existence of other minds, and therefore we cannot meaningfully say that other minds are real/exist.

#### Revised

Problem of other minds: we cannot know that there are other minds since we only experience ‘the mind’ privately, through introspection. I only experience other people’s behaviour so other minds are a hypothesis at best. For the dualist, this is an issue because the mind is a separate substance to the body, and so its existence can be doubted independently of scepticism about the body.

### How does philosophical behaviourism explain the mind?

Philosophical behaviourism claims that the mind is simply what a person says or does (behaviours). All statements concerning mental states or processes are not concerned with a private world, rather, talk about minds is reducible to talk of behaviour.
#### Revised

Philosophical behaviouralism claims that minds are just what people say and do - they are not private or accessed through introspection. Talk of mental states is analytically reducible (i.e. reducible without remainder) to talk about behavioural states.
</br>

### Explain what is meant by:

#### Analytic behaviourism

Analytic behaviourism is so named because analysis of the language of mind reveals that all can be reduced to statements about behaviour.

#### Analytic reduction.

Analytic reduction means that statements about minds mean the same as statements about behaviour in the same way that ‘mother’ means ‘female parent’.

##### Revised

Analysis of language of minds leads to simple statements of behaviour, e.g. pain (mental state) = screaming, crying, etc. (pain behaviour)

</br>
### How does philosophical behaviourism resolve the issue of other minds?

Philosophical behaviourism argues that we can observe another person’s behaviour, and since behaviour is alike with mind, it is reasonable to believe that said person has a mind, and thus other minds exist.

#### Revised

Philosophical behaviourism eliminates the problem of other minds because minds = behaviours; to know someone’s mental state is to observe their behaviours.
</br>

### Outline the three arguments for philosophical behaviourism.

1) The dualist admits that we have access to the behaviour of others, and therefore behaviour must be the basis for all of our language about others. Theories such as Ayer’s verification principle reject the idea that other minds could be isolated from the possibility of detection. Talk of things which cannot be verified is meaningless, and the failure to recognise this means that dualists become concerned with the problem of other minds. Behaviourism eliminates this problem by equating mind with what observable behaviour.

2) Behaviourism overcomes the interaction problem that plagues substance dualism. If the mind is not a distinct substance or property that is somehow linked to the body, then there is no causal interaction to account for.

3) If words acquire their meaning from the context in which they are used, then it follows that there are rules which determine their proper usage. Therefore, it must be possible to determine whether they are being used correctly through comparison to what is observable. However, if mental-state terms acquire their meaning through reference to private experiences within each of our minds, it is impossible to tell whether the words are being used correctly or not (as there is no public context by which to compare them). Talk of mind would become impossible. Therefore, when we talk of minds, we *must* be talking about what is publicly observable in order to avoid confusion and retain any meaning.

#### Revised

1) If, as the dualist claims, we have access to others’ behaviours, then this behaviour must be the basis of our knowledge about others. Dualism faces the problem of other minds but philosophical behaviourism focuses on what is observable, and therefore avoids the problem and meets the verification principle.
 
 2) Overcomes the interaction problem as there is no causal link between mind and body

3) There are public rules governing the use of words; if mental states are only private, we cannot talk meaning fully about them. Philosophical behaviourism means we can talk meaningfully about mental states.

### Explain how Hempel’s hard behaviourism is influenced by the work of the Vienna Circle.

The Vienna Circle promoted *logical positivism*, a form of empiricism which proposes that a meaningful proposition must have empirical content and thus make positive claims about our experience. Hempel, therefore, adhered to the verificationist account of meaning. Since other minds cannot be observed, talk about them is either meaningless or reducible to what can be observed, which for Hempel means that meaningful talk about human minds require evidence that our claims about them can be reduced to behavioural descriptions.

#### Revised

Hempel’s behaviourism adheres to the verificationist theory of meaning. 

### Use the examples of Dolores and Paul to illustrate Hempel’s hard behaviourism.

Suppose that Dolores has trodden on a nail, and is in significant pain, swearing, shouting, and attempting to remove the nail from her foot. Hempel says that this behaviour must constitute what it means to say that she is in pain, as the pain is not a private experience which causes Dolores’ behaviour, but just is the behaviour. 

Hempel gives his own example of ‘Paul has a toothache’. He proposes multiple test sentences which would provide the circumstances in which the statement would be verified, for example: ‘Paul weeps and makes gestures of such and such kinds’, ‘At the question ‘what is the matter?’ Paul responds ‘I have a toothache’, ‘closer examination reveals a decayed tooth’, etc etc.

All of these circumstances verify the statement that ‘Paul has a toothache’.

#### Revised

Paul has a toothache. We know this because: 

- We can observe neurophysiological states in his brain
- We can observe tooth decay
- He is screaming (apparently)
- He says ‘I have a toothache’
- His nervous system indicates pain, e.g. high blood pressure

This is the only way to establish Paul’s mental state (of pain) - all we have is behaviour.
