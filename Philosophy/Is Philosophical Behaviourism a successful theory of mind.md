# Is Philosophical Behaviourism a Successful Theory of Mind?

</br>

## Dualist Arguments

### Conceivability

Mind without body is conceivable - because we can conceive of them as separate things, they cannot be the same

#### Response

- The conditions for verification are empirical or analytic truth, so only behaviour can provide explanations of mental states. Mind without body (behaviour) fails the verification principle.
- Mind does not exist in the same way that bodies exist - dualism commits a category mistake.

</br>

### Indivisibility

Mind and body have separate properties - the physical is spatially divisible, but the mind is not.

#### Response

- Mental properties are not distinct from physical/behavioural properties; category mistake

</br>

### Evaluation

Ryle’s category mistake begins from a position of physicalism and therefore assumes that there is nothing over and above the physical. In his example of the university, we might argue that he has rather missed the point and that ‘Oxford University’ is not completely defined by its content; instead, here is some thing which is Oxford University, however intangible that is.

</br>

## Other Issues
### Multiple Realisability

Mental states can be realised in multiple ways, therefore we cannot produce a clear and finite list of behavioural (mental states).

### Circularity

We cannot talk about conditions of verification for mental states without reference to other mental states.

</br>

#### Hempel’s Response

Brain processes remain the same, even while behavioural states differ; behavioural states can be seen as a secondary part of brain states. We should focus primarily an physiological states.

</br>

#### Ryle’s Response

Dispositional statements are ‘open’ and so cannot be completely replaced by hypothetical statements, e.g. pain could be any number of dispositions - scream, cry, run away, stoicism

##### Response to Ryle

- It is unclear whether there is any stable connection between mental and behavioural states

- Openness is too vague; if mental state x could = infinite behaviours/dispositions, it is not clear that we could establish a certain translation from mental to behaviourial states

- Liebniz’s law: if 2 things share all the same properties, they are identical, so mental states ≠ behavioural states, since the properties may vary. 

Ryle argues in response that Liebniz’s law is about metaphysical identity so does not apply to his theory, as he is providing an analysis of meaning rather than a metaphysical identity claim. There is sufficient overlap between behavioural dispositions that we have good grounds for suggesting a commonality of mental states (so not dealing with complete openness of dispositions).

We should focus more broadly on behavioural dispositions than on individual pieces of behaviour, since all behavioural states are part of a more complex web, e.g. how I react to the snake is connected to other dispositions I hold.

<br>

### What is meant by the Asymmetry between Self-knowledge and of Knowledge of other people’s Mental States?

We are directly aware of our own mental states through introspection and self-consciousness, but can only infer the mental states of others from their behaviour. We cannot make mistakes about our own mental states, but we can make mistakes about the mental states of others.

</br>

### What Problem Does This Asymmetry Raise for Philosophical Behaviourism?

If mental states were dispositions to behaviour, then this would not be true. Saying ‘I am in pain’ would, under behaviourism, equate to me saying ‘My behaviour shows that I am in pain’. But surely this isn’t right? We experience our own mental states directly. Philosophical behaviourism denies an obvious asymmetry.

</br>

### Explain how Ryle Responds to this objection, with reference to a) Consciousness as a Myth; b) Consciousness as Awareness; and c) how Consciousness Provides Knowledge of My Own and others’ Mental States

##### Consciousness as a Myth

Ryle argues that consciousness (self-knowledge through introspection) is a myth. He says that self-knowledge and our knowledge of other minds are on par with each other, and therefore we can make reliable claims about our own behaviour or that of others. The difference is simply that there is more evidence available to ourselves than others.

##### Consciousness as Awareness

To be conscious, Ryle argues, is to be able and ready to say what we think or feel, and be unsurprised by the occurrence of said thought or feeling. Consciousness therefore provides the same kind of knowledge in cases of knowing our own mental states and knowing the mental states of others. The difference is that, in our own cases, we have more evidence, because we are able to use introspection, whilst we cannot use this in the case of other minds.

##### How consciousness provides knowledge of my own and others’ mental states

Knowing what you are thinking is no different in kind from knowing what another person is thinking - we can know just as directly what someone thinks when they speak, at least when they speak honestly (the most natural way to speak). When we speak like this, no matter to which audience, we are expressing our mental states. Close attention to what we say uncovers knowledge of the mind of whoever is talking. Introspection is no different, it is just the same concept applied to ourselves.

</br>

### Explain two possible objections to Ryle’s theory of consciousness

One possible objection is to ask whether thinking can be understood in terms of inner dialogue, and can that dialogue form the model for mental process in general? We are not saying anything to ourselves here.

A second possible objection is that Ryle misses out the subjective, experiential aspect of mental states and processes. Certain experiences have distinctive qualities, and these are central to our mental lives. I have an awareness of his aspect for my own mental states, but not for the mental states of others. The objection raised is that philosophical behaviourism cannot account for this aspect of self-knowledge, and the asymmetry between self-knowledge and knowledge of the mental states of others.

#### Revised

1) Understanding thinking as internalised speech does not accurately capture all types of thought, e.g. mood/feeling is not a behaviour as such - I feel happiness rather than speak it internally
2) Ryle neglects the subjective aspect of mental states, e.g. how it feels to be in pain is different from being aware of other people’s pain (this uses the verification principle - subjective experiences are meaningless since they can neither be verified empirically nor analytically) 

</br>

### Explain the claim that mental states cannot be completely capture by behaviour and behavioural dispositions

Behaviours associated with mental states don’t fully capture the mental state itself, e.g. ‘being in pain’ refers to behaviours such as wincing, crying, saying ‘I’m in pain’, etc., as well as ‘what it is like’ to feel pain (the essence of the mental state). Philosophical behaviourism fails to account for this satisfactorily.

Hempel’s response is that understanding mental states is tied up with behavioural states - we cannot talk meaningfully about mental states without reference to behaviour. However, an actor can convince us that they have one mental state whilst feeling another.

Ryle’s response consists of two arguments: 

a) we should consider physiological behaviours: brain connections and neural pathways are part of behaviour

b) Importance of dispositions: if this person was not acting, they would behave like $x$ (they are disposed to behave like this). Dispositions are relevant to specific contexts, e.g. a sugar cube has the disposition to only dissolve in water; an actor only has the disposition to feel pain in an instance when they have been physically harmed.

</br>

### 8

The counter-response to Ryle’s response is Putnam’s super-spartans - they are trained to suppress pain, so they do not express any behaviours associated with pain. Therefore there is nothing which always distinguishes certain behavioural states from others.

Hempel replies that mental states can be explained fully by a range of behaviours - only when we display *all* of them can we identify the mental state (e.g. mental illness). We therefore cannot meaningfully talk about mental states of super-spartans, since they are unable to meet all conditions for verification.
