# Evaluating Kant

</br>

## a) Universality and Morality

</br>

### 1)

Kant equates what is moral (morally binding duties) with maxims that are universalisable. Is he right to do so? 

Could there be a case of a universalisable maxim that is nonetheless morally wrong? It is not so difficult to contrive maxims of such specificity ('to steal from market stalls selling novelty umbrellas on Wednesdays before midday when there are three letters in one's name). Universalising them would apply so rarely that the concept of private property is not contradicted.

Kant's response to this is very straightforward: his theory is concerned with the true maxim underpinning the pseudo-clever contrived maxim, namely 'to steal when I can't afford what I want'. In short, when applying the test of universalisability we need to be honest about the true nature of our motivation (and hence the maxim on which we are acting).

So, what about a very specific maxim that is honest about its motivation? e.g. 'to borrow money on a promise to repay that I do not intend to keep but only in the most desperate of circumstances'. Is this universalisable? We might argue that it is - it wouldn't occur in enough circumstances to undermine the concept of promise-keeping.

If we think it isn't wrong, then this is not a counter-example (i.e. the maxim can be universalised). But if deception in this situation (rather than asking for assistance) is wrong, then we have the problem of an action that is wrong together with a maxim that is universalisable - in which case the Categorial Imperative fails and it is not always right to do something when a maxim is universalisable.
</br>

### 2) 

A good example of this is the axe murderer. The axe murderer who asks where the refugees he wants to kill are hidden are hidden and you know the answer. Even in this situation, Kant insists, you should not lie and claim ignorance of their hiding place because lying is always wrong. (We can't universalise the maxim to deceive people). But most would argue that Kant is wrong - the moral action is to lie. On the other hand, maybe Kant is wrong about the maxim in this situation. Maybe it is 'to lie to save a life' which can be universalised. 

Another example is the shop worker who wins the lottery and vows never to sell anything again, but only to buy. This isn't morally wrong but it can't be universalised if no one ever sold but only bought, then there would be no means of buying (therefore causing contradiction). Thus, the test of universalisability gives the wrong answer: it is not always wrong to do things which require others to do something different.
</br>

## b) Conflicts between duties
</br>

### 3)
We might criticise Kant in terms of the conflict of duties. Specifically, central to Kant's ethics is the idea that our moral duties are absolutely and categorically binding obligations. And yet, there would seem to be cases in which two absolute duties conflict with each other - e.g. if I promise to keep a secret to Person A, and person B asks if whatever is kept a secret is true, then there seems to be a conflict between the duty to keep promises (in relation to person A) and to tell the truth (in relation to person B)  

Kant's response is that "real" conflicts of duty cannot occur - if there seems to be a conflict that is because we've misunderstood what at least one of the duties requires us to do - we must formulate duties with care so as to avoid apparent conflicts. So Kant might say that, in our example, one of the duties has been misformulated and needs to be more specific - perhaps the duty to keep promises needs to be refined: a duty to "keep promises unless doing so will cause harm", in which case the conflict is resolved - the duty to tell the truth. 

Another response to the problem might be to argue that most duties are no absolute. So, there is a duty not to like, but that can be overridden to save someone's life - less important duties can 'give way' to more important duties. But this response severely compromises Kant's theory, which is based in the idea that duties are categorical/absolute Indeed, it seems in danger of collapsing Kantian ethics into a version of consequentialism.

</br>

## c) The view that consequences of actions determine their moral value
</br>

### 4)

Utilitarianism contends that if it is my duty not to kill (as Kant insists), that must be because there is something bad about killing. But if so, then I should try to ensure that there is as little killing as possible, and if in a given situation I know that unless I kill person A then person B-G will die, how can I not justify killing person A? So , Utilitarianism insists that it is not only my duty not to kill because killing is bad - I should prevent more deaths, in which case I have a duty to kill person A to save person B-G. What makes a will good is that it wills good ends (i.e. good outcomes)

Kant's response is that no ends (outcomes) are inherently good (i.e. good without qualification), so this fails to understand the good will.

</br>

### 5)

But the criticism can be pushed further. Utilitarianism understands all moral reasoning as means-ends reasoning - what is rational is what leads to the best outcome (the good end). Utilitarianism argues that it is obvious that we should do what we can to produce as many good outcomes as possible. 

Of course, Kant offers a very different account of moral reasoning; the Utilitarian approach is fine in the context of hypothetical imperatives, but there is much more to morality than that: there are also imperatives - categorical imperatives - that we should follow regardless of the outcomes. If there were no such imperatives, then morality would simply be about fulfilling desires (i.e. outcomes that we will) 

Mill's response is that happiness is the only desirable end (i.e. we can 'rescue' ethics by agreeing that we all desire happiness). But Kant argues that happiness is not always good (e.g. the happiness the racist finds in racism)

</br>

### 6)

Foot argues that there are no categorical imperatives and that what it is rational for someone to do depends on what they want (i.e. what ends or outcomes they will). She contends that the hypothetical/categorical distinction is merely a matter of language - while on the one hand, moral judgements are non-hypothetical because we don't withdraw them depending on what someone wants. So, as in the case of the etiquette surrounding shaking hands: the 'should not hold someone's hand for an excessive amount of time' obligation does not change simply because of what the hand-shaker wants - e.g. whether or not they want to fit in. 

To act irrationally, Foot insists, is to act in a way that defeats/undermines one's own purposes (ends), and acting immorally need not involve such action.

</br>

### 7)

Why do we think that the rules of morality are categorical (following Kant) when the rules of etiquette aren't categorical, even though both are 'non-hypothetical'? Foot says that the answer lies in our feelings about morality - she argues that what she calls the 'binding force' of morality is simply the feeling that moral judgements are inescapable - and we think that certain obligations are inescapable not because of the demands of reason (as Kant argues) but because of how they are taught.
</br>

## d) Morality is a system of hypothetical imperatives 
</br>


### Explain Foot’s argument that Kant’s distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives is merely a matter of language, with reference to the example of the rules of a club 

Foot’s argument is that there are no categorical imperatives in the Kantian sense – in other words, there are no rules that we are obliged to follow regardless of what we want (i.e. the outcomes/ends we want to achieve). All moral imperatives are hypothetical imperatives. 

Foot admits that, in ordinary language, we do contrast two different uses of ‘ought’ – ‘oughts’ that are dependent on what we want to achieve (as in ‘if you want to achieve good grades then you ought to revise’) and ‘oughts’ that aren’t dependent on what you want to achieve (so, ‘even if you want to trick your friend, you ought not to lie because lying is wrong’). 

But Foot’s point is that this is simply a matter of language, and not enough to show that Kant is right that some imperatives are categorical. Foot gives the example of the rules (etiquette) of a gentlemans club: the imperative ‘men ought not take ladies into the smoking room’. She chooses the example of etiquette to illustrate her point because we don’t withdraw the ought’ depending on what one of the members happens to want (let’s say, he wants to leave the club the following day – even so, the ‘ought’ remains). So the imperative seems non-hypothetical in Kant’s sense. But at the same time, it is obviously not categorical in Kant’s sense – by themselves, club rules/etiquette do not by themselves give us a reason to act (as Kant claims categorical imperatives do). Whether you have a reason to follow the rules/etiquette depends on what you want (if you don’t like the rules of the club, don’t join. If you don’t like the etiquette surrounding handshakes, then avoid shaking hands). So, moral imperatives are non-hypothetical in one sense, but not thereby categorical – they are a special type of hypothetical imperative. What type?... 
</br>

### Explain Foot’s claim that moral judgements are not categorical, with reference to what Foot considers is the ‘binding force’ of morality. 
 

Foot argues that what distinguishes the ‘binding force’ of moral imperatives from other imperatives is not the categorical/hypothetical distinction but the fact that moral imperatives (such as ‘don’t lie’) carry a certain type of feeling with them (a feeling of inescapability). The reason for this feeling is the manner in which those imperatives are taught. The rules of morality are taught much more forcibly and stringently than, say, the rules of etiquette. Because of this training we feel that what we ought to do is morally right regardless of our subjective desires and aims. But this is not the same as saying that such imperatives are categorical, as Kant claims.  
</br>
### Outline two potential objections to Foot’s argument  

If Foot is right that there are no categorical imperatives, then does ‘acting out of duty’ become meaningless? No, says Foot, though Kant is wrong to suppose that the motive of duty is the only morally good motive. We care about the good of others regardless of our duty. We can understand ‘doing the right thing because it is the right thing’ as motivated by morally good concerns about good outcomes for others. A virtuous person is precisely the person who is consistently dedicated to such outcomes.  

Does Foot’s argument undermine morality? Specifically, what can we say to amoralists who simply don’t care about morality? Foot’s response is that there is only so much we can do to convince the amoralist (who believes they have no reason to be moral) beyond seeking to convince them that such an attitude is likely to damage the quality of their lives. The answer isn’t to insist, as Kant does, on the existence of categorical imperatives!

</br>

## The value of certain motives
</br>

### Outline the objection that Kant does not recognise the value of being motivated by love or kindness. How might Kant reply?

In his insistence that there is only one properly moral motive (i.e. duty), Kant ignores the moral value of other sources of moral motivation, such as love, kindness, care, or friendship. 

So, Kant's theory leads us to a situation in which if I visit a friend in hospital because I understand it as my duty, them my action has moral value, but it doesn't if I visit them because I love them/want to be kind, etc.

A possible Kantian response is to say that Kant does not dismiss the moral value of other motives as such, what is important is that we set these other motives aside when they conflict with our duty (in other words, it is not that Kant completely rejects the moral value of motives other than duty, simply that we recognise that duty is the sovereign moral motive - the one that rules over all others, otherwise morality risks collapsing into a dependence on our feeling).
