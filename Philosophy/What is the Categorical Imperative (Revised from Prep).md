# What is the Categorical Imperative?

</br>

### Explain the (first) formulation of the categorical imperative?

Kant says that you should 'act only on that maxim through which at the same time will that it should become a universal law'. This is the categorical imperative. Kant rephrases this as 'to have a good will, I should act only on maxims that I can also will everyone to act on'.

##### Revised

To have a good will is to act out of duty - but what is 'acting out of duty?' Answer: to obey the categorical imperative. But what is the Categorial imperative (and why should I obey it)?

The first formulation of the Categorial Imperative is 'to act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law'. 

In short, we need to apply a test to the maxims on which we act: the test of universalisability - is it rational to will that everyone (the universal) should act on the maxim on which I am choosing to act on in the present circumstance? To adopt this principle (i.e. the test) as a principle of choice doesn't specify a goal or end (i.e. does not refer to outcomes - e.g. the goal of happiness). It only refers to a principle for everyone - i.e. a universal law and obligation (duty).
</br>

### How does the first formulation of the categorical imperative serve as a motive or criterion for the good will?

The 'good will' relies upon the categorical imperative (it is necessary to the good will). It does not specify any end goal, arguing that you should be motivated to do something simply because it is considered to be 'right'

##### Revised

To have a good will is only to act on maxims that I can also will everyone to act on (i.e. maxims that I can universalise).

### Explain the difference between a hypothetical and a categorical imperative (Illustrate your answer with examples)

A hypothetical imperative is a statement about what you ought to do, assuming that there is some sort of end goal. For example, 'if you want to see the show, you ought to get to the theatre at least 15 minutes early'. This makes it a conditional statement, and the command 'get to the theatre at least 15 minutes early' is the condition. Kant argues that willing the end entails willing the means (this is an analytic truth). This is separate from a categorical imperative, in that a categorical imperative has no goal/end, whereas a hypothetical imperative does.

##### Revised

An imperative is a command (e.g. 'you ought to be quiet!'): an 'ought' statement. Hypothetical imperatives are conditional. If $x$ is the desired outcome, and $y$ is the best way of achieving $x$, you ought to do $y$. $y$ is conditional on $x$: $y$ is only the thing you ought to do if $x$ is the desired outcome. 

N.B. the utility principle is a hypothetical imperative: if you want to maximise happiness, then do $y$

Categorical imperatives are unconditional: no matter what one wants or desires, regardless of one's interests in the matter or particular circumstances, one is obliged to fulfil them. In short, they are universally binding; universal duties.

So, whereas hypothetical imperatives can be avoided by rejecting the, categorical imperatives are differently structured - there is no condition - they are universal.

### Kant argues that there are two ways in which we could fail to be able to will our maxim to become a universal law: contradiction in conception and contradiction in will. Outline the difference between the two types of contradiction or 'test'

Contradiction in conception is the situation in which everyone that acts on a certain maxim is self-contradictory. Let us say that you act upon the maxim 'I can steal something that I want'. You cannot will for everyone to act upon this maxim, because if everyone stole things, the concept of stealing would be obsolete (to steal from someone they must own the stolen thing, and if everyone steals, ownership ceases to exist; therefore you cannot steal anything). This contradicts itself.

Contradiction in will means that, while the maxim is not self-contradictory when universalised, we still cannot rationally will it. We cannot will a situation in which it is impossible to achieve our ends (this contradicts the very act of willing), and it is possible that the only available means to an end is to do something which we do not want to do. We cannot therefore will that this possibility is denied to us, and we cannot therefore will this situation.

##### Revised
Kant identifies two ways in which a maxim might fail the test of universalisability: contradiction in conception and contradiction in will.

Contradiction in conception: the maxim cannot be consistently universalised because a situation in which everyone acted on it is impossible; e.g. the maxim 'to steal something I want if I can't afford it'. It is inconceivable - i.e. a contradiction in conception - for everyone to steal things. By definition, you cannot steal something unless it belongs to someone else. Stealing presupposes the idea of ownership. But such ownership is impossible if it is true that you can steal $x$ if you want it but can't afford it.

Contradiction in will: the maxim cannot be willed in a universal form because a situation in which it was universally followed undermines the operation of the will; e.g. the refusal to help others, ever. Kant argues that this involves a contradiction in will, thus:

P<sub>1</sub>: A will, by definition, wills ends (goals/outcomes)

P<sub>2</sub>: To will ends, we must will the necessary means (to achieve that end)

C<sub>1</sub>: Therefore we cannot rationally will a situation in which it is impossible to achieve our ends. To do so is to stop willing the necessary means to achieve one's ends, which is effectively to cease willing any ends at all (the very act of willing is contradicted - see P<sub>2</sub>)

P<sub>3</sub>: It is possible that the only means to our ends, in certain situations, involves the help of others

C<sub>2</sub>: Therefore we cannot will that this possibility is denied to us

C<sub>3</sub>: Therefore we cannot will a situation in which no one ever helps anyone else

### Explain the relation between morality and reason in Kant's Deontology

Kant argues that not only is it morally wrong to disobey the categorical imperative, but it is also irrational. Reason determines our duties and gives us motivation to perform them. In addition, it is intuitive to say that morality applies to all and only rational beings. A protest against moral injustice usually makes sense to reason, and with this link we can explain the nature of morality in terms of reason. Morality is universal, and so is reason. Neither is dependent upon our wants.

##### Revised

The relation between morality and reason in Kant's Deontology is very close indeed: to obey the categorical imperative is to act rationally (there is a strict identification between what is moral and what is rational) - hence the tests for the universalisability of maxims involve the search for possible contradictions (in will or conception). To act immorally is to act irrationally, which is to say to contradict oneself.

### What is the second formulation of the categorical imperative?

Kant puts this as 'act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end'. By this, he means that people are ends in themselves, and we must therefore always treat them as such, not as only a means to an end. While we can rely on them as a means, we must always respect them as an end as well. To treat someone as a means undermines their ability to make a rational choice.

##### Revised

Kant argues that the 'good will' is the only thing that is valuable in itself - everything is only valuable on account of the value we attach to it as a means to an end (i.e. as a way of achieving a desired outcome/goal/purpose). Thus, value as means to an end is subjective. But this does not apply to other humans. Humans are not valuable as means to whatever ends we consider worthwhile, rather humans have intrinsic worth that Kant identifies as dignity. And what gives humans this dignity is their possession of a rational will. 
</br>

### On what grounds does Kant argue that humans have intrinsic moral worth?

Kant argues that humans have intrinsic moral worth on the grounds that we have rational will (dignity). The will gives value (unconditionally) to everything else. By 'humanity', Kant means our ability to rationally determine which ends to adopt and pursue.
</br>

### Explain Kant's claim that we must treat humans as ends in themselves

Kant claims that someone being an end in themselves means that they are also an end for others, and that we should adopt their ends as our own. The second formulation requires that we help other people, and claims that this is one of our ends in life.
