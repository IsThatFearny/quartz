### Trademark argument

The trademark argument states that god is an innate ‘trademark’ in our minds. Descartes says that because we have a concept of god, which is something infinite and perfect, and because our minds are finite, there is a concept of something with more reality than my own mind. Therefore, the concept of god must be as much reality as what the concept is of. Something cannot come from nothing, so whatever is part of the effect must have originated in the cause. Ideas of substance can only be caused by substances, and so our minds could not have created it.
