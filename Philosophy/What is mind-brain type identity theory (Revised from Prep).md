# What is mind-brain type identity theory?
</br>

### What is the central claim of MBTIT?

The central claim is that mental properties *just are* physical properties. Thinking a thought or feeling an itch is exactly the same thing as certain neurons firing.

#### Revised

Mental properties ‘just are’ physical properties of the brain, e.g. mental state $x$ = physical state $y$. ‘I am in pain’ = ‘$xyz$ neurons are firing in my brain’.

</br>

### How does MBTIT understand mental properties?

MBTIT understands mental properties as being the same thing as physical properties, likely being highly complex neurophysical properties. Similarly to brains, which have physical properties of size and weight, neurophysical properties such as synaptic connections, neurochemistry, etc. are also physical properties. 

</br>

### What evidence is used to support MBTIT?

Mental events and states are very closely interlinked with and dependent upon the brain, so the mind has become synonymous with the brain in the public mind. Thus, everything mental is assumed to be neurophysical.

#### Revised 

Neuroscientific developments show the close relationship between brain and mental states. If we put a giant stick in Mesi’s brain, her mental states will change.

</br>

### How does MBTIT respond to the claim that mental properties do not seem the same as neurophysiological properties?

This criticism arises because we have different ways of gaining knowledge about these properties. Many things that have been uncovered by science have turned out to be not what they seemed to be.

### Explain the claim that correlation is not identity, the relevant of this for MBTIT, and why Smart argues that we should argue for identity rather than correlation

Having a heart is correlated with having kidneys - if you have a heart then it stands to reason that you also have kidneys. However, these are clearly distinct things! Simply pointing out that everything that has a particular brain state also has a similar mental state does not show that they are the same thing. Correlation is not identity.

Smart’s response is that this is the simplest answer. The motivation for the theory, he argues, is Occam’s razor. If there are no overwhelming arguments in favour of dualism, then we should reject the idea of distinct non-physical substances or properties.

### Explain Smart’s argument that MBTIT’s identity claim is not meant to be analytically true

The identity theorist is not defining the terms that we use, and therefore the identity claim is not meant to be analytically true. The concepts and terms remain distinct, and the claim is in fact that these concepts refer to the same thing in the world. Two concepts, one property.

</br>

### How does Smart respond to the claim that we can talk about sensations without knowing anything about brains?

Smart says that we can talk about lightning without the understanding of electrical discharge, because the two concepts are distinct. Or alternatively, water and H<sub>2</sub>0 are distinct concepts and so we can talk about water without any understanding of the molecular formula.

### Explain the claim that MBTIT is a type of reductive physicalism

MBTIT is a type of reductive physicalism because it claims that the things in one domain are ontologically identical with some of the things in another domain, i.e. mental and physical things. Every mental property is a certain physical property. There is nothing more to mental properties than this.
