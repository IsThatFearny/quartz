# How successful is the knowledge/Mary argument as an argument for property dualism?

Jackson’s knowledge argument, i.e. the argument that concludes that not all facts are physical facts, and therefore physicalism is false, seems to hold. There are multiple claims against it, but all are responded to well and soundly. The argument that Mary does not gain propositional knowledge as the argument claims, but instead gains ability knowledge, is responded to by arguing that knowing *how* cannot fully capture the phenomenal properties of a colour, i.e. experiencing the colour, and so if Mary has ability knowledge, she does not really ‘know’ what it is like to see red. A rebuttal can also be applied to the proposal that Mary gains acquaintance knowledge instead of propositional knowledge: acquaintance knowledge and propositional knowledge are inextricably linked, and acquaintance knowledge cannot exist without propositional knowledge.
