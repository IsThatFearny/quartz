# Criticisms of the Philosophical Zombies argument for Property Dualism

</br>

#### Philosophical Zombies are not metaphysically possible

The philosophical zombie argument assumes that qualia is non-physical. If qualia is physical, then philosophical zombies cannot be a complete duplicate of a human and is not metaphysically possible. It would not be possible for a physical duplicate without qualia to exist. To think of $xyz$ neurons firing is to think of phenomenal properties.

#### What is metaphysically possible tells us nothing about the actual world

If we can show that Philosophical Zombies are possible, all we have established is that they are possible in *some* world, not necessarily this one. So, all the Philosophical Zombies argument shows is that Philosophical Zombies are possible, not that Property Dualism is true. 

**Response (Kripke):** If $A = B$, then $A\: must = B$ in every possible world, so if physical properties ≠ phenomenal properties in some possible world, then they are not the same in any possible world.

#### Property Dualism makes a category mistake

Property Dualism claims that there is one substance and two properties. As such, it places phenomenal properties in the same category as physical properties. However, talking about ‘what it is like’ (phenomenal properties) is purely evaluative - we are talking about our experience of the physical, rathre than a distinct property. So it is a category mistake to talk of phenomenal properties in the same vein as physical properties.
