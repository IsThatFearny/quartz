[Substance Dualism]: The mind and the body are separate substances
	+ <Indivisibility Argument>: Body is divisible; mind is indivisible. If two things do not sare all properties, then they are not identical. Thus, mind and body are separate substances
		- <Mental is divisible in some sense>: Mind is divisible, e.g. certain mental illnesses cause a split between different parts of the brain
			+ <Descartes' Response>: The way that the two are divisible is different - bodies are functionally divisible, minds are only spatially divisible
		- <Not everything thought of as physical is divisible>: Is what is extended always divisible? We cannot, for example, divide atoms any further. Divisibility may not be an essential property of physical substance
			+ <Possible response>: Even if waves or atoms cannot be divided in reality, we can still conceive of them having half the size. There is no logical limit to how small spatial parts can be
		- <Is the mind a substance?>: The argument assumes that minds are substances. Perhaps, however, there are only mental properties of the brain. These properties in general are not spatially divisible. Descartes must show that this theory is false for his divisibility argument to succeed
	+ <Conceivability Argument>: I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking that that is not extended; I also have a clear and distinct idea of body as something that is extended and does not think. Thus, God can create these things in a way that corresponds to my thought. Mind and body can therefore exist independently of each other, and are separate substances
		- <Mind without body is not conceivable>: Behaviourism, for example, claims that the mind should be analysed in terms of behaviour. Without a body, something cannot exhibit behaviour, and thus with no behaviour there is no mind. It is therefore inconceivable for mind without body to exist. We can make mistakes over what is conceivable.
			+ <Descartes' Response to mind w/o body>: Descartes accepts this argument, but argues that if we have an idea of something clearly and distinctly, then we cannot be mistaken. We must thus make an objection to clear and distinct ideas to challenge the conceivability argument
		- <What is conceivable may not be metaphysically possible>: Masked man fallacy: I believe that the masked man has robbed a bank, and I believe that my father has not rrobbed the bank. Thus, I conceive that the masked man is not my father; this is a logical impossibility. It is also metaphysically impossible that my father is the masked man, because one person cannot be someone else. Applying this to Descartes' argument, we can argue that the mind may not be an ontologically independent substance, and it would therefore be metaphysically impossible for it to exist separately from the body
			+ <Descartes' response on metaphysical possibility>: Descartes is happy to grant that we cannot infer what is metaphysically possible from what we think, but in the case of clear and distinct ideas, the inference is justified. We can *clearly and distinctly* conceiuve that mind and body are separate substances, and therefore it is possible that they are. When applied to the Masked Man Fallacy, we can argue that my concepts in this argument are not clear and distinct
		- <What is metaphysically possible tells us nothing about the actual world>: It is metaphysically possible that mind and body are distinct substances (we can conceive of this clearly and distinctly). However, it is thus equally possible that thought and extension are two properrties of a single substance. Possibility does not guarantee certainty.
			+ <Descartes' possible response>: If Descartes could prove that mind and body as the same substance is metaphysically impossible, then he could argue that they are distinct via negation.

#### Issues facing substance Dualism


```argdown
[Interactionist Substance Dualism]: The mind has causal power and interacts with the body
	- <Conceptual Interaction Problem>: If the mind is pure thought, then it has no physical force of any kind. How, therefore, could it interact physically with the body - nothing can come into a spatial relationship with something that is not spatial itself.
	- <Empirical Interaction Problem 1>: The law of conservation of energy states that matter/energy can neither be created nor destroyed. If the mind, a non-physical substance, moved the body, then the total amount of energy in the universe would increase. This would serve to prove our understanding of the universe as a closed system wrong, and physics would not be able to give us the complete account of physical energy in the universe. Physics is wrong to think that physical movement can only be caused by a physical force
	- <Empirical Interaction Problem 2>: If the mind moves the body, it does so by changing what happens in the brain. We may object that we have no evidence of the mind changing what happens in the brain.
		+ <Possible response to interaction problem>: We have no evidence that this claim is false, either. Neuroscience still gives no clear account of the complicated nature of causation involved in something like making a choice. If interactionist dualism is true, then when neuroscience progresses far enough, it will show that some events in the brain have no physical cause, because they are caused by the mind

[Epiphenomenalist Substance Dualism]: The mind has no causal powers and so does not interact with the body
	- <Epiphenomenalism does not accord with our experience>: It seems that we do experience causal connections between mental states and behaviour. It is part of my experience that pain, for example, will cause me to act differently. Epiphenomenalism must argue that my experience is misleading in this respect.
	- <Knowledge of our own mental states>: Epiphenomenalism makes it difficult to understand how we can have knowledge of our own mental states. The obvious answer is that I can tell that I am in pain, for example, through introspection. But, if epiphenomenalism is true, then pain causes nothing, not even the belief that I am in pain. This threatens a natural account of self-knowledge. I cannot know my own mind.
	- <Problem of other minds>: We cannot know other people's minds through introspection. If mind and body are independent, then how can we infer the existence of minds attached to bodies, just by seeing the bodies?
		+ <Argument from analogy>: I have a mind; I know from experience that my mental states cause my behaviour; Other people have bodies similar to mine and behave similarly to me in similar situations; By analogy, their behaviour is caused by mental states, as mine is; Therefore, other people have minds
			- <Use of induction>: The conclusion that other people have minds is based on a single case - my own. We cannot generalise from one case, because it could be a special case.
		+ <Analogy from behaviour>: Many different behaviours have mental causes. Other people exhibit similar behaviours, and these behaviours too have mental causes; therefore, other people have minds
			- <Not all behaviours have mental causes>: Whilst many behaviours do have mental causes, some do not. Therefore, claiming that many behaviours have a mental cause is not strong enough tio support the claim that the behaviour of others has mental causes
			- <Relies on a contentious claim>: The argument relies on the claim that similar effects have similar causes. But sometimes, similar effects can have different causes, and this could be what is occuring in these behaviours.
		+ <Best hypothesis>:
