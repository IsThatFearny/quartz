# Cosmological Arguments (Revised from Prep)

</br>





### What characterises cosmological arguments?

The question that characterises these arguments is ‘why does anything exist’? The argument is that unless God exists, this question remains unanswerable.





#### Revised

The Cosmological Argument poses the question ‘Why does anything exist?’ (‘Why something rather than nothing?). The Cosmological Argument argues that the only answer to this question is God. It is an **a posteriori argument** - there is something (evident to the senses) - why? What is the cause of the something?

</br>

### Outline and explain the Kalam argument, with particular reference to the claim that an infinite regress of temporal phenomena is impossible

P1: The universe is composed to temporal phenomena that are preceded by other temporal phenomena that are ordered in time.





P2: An infinite regress of temporal phenomena is impossible

C1: Therefore, the universe must have a beginning

P3: Everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence

C2: Therefore, there is a cause of the existence of the universe


To conclude that *God* is the cause of the universe, we must add further premises to the argument, i.e. an argument for accepting P2. Certain paradoxes can be introduced which establish P2 and prove that an infinite regress of temporal phenomena is impossible:

The concept of infinity is not one of a number. You cannot add 1 to infinity to make infinity + 1. It is impossible for there to be an ‘actual infinity’. If we apply this to the universe, then we see a problem: if the universe is infinitely old, then it does not get any older as time passes, and to have reached the present, an infinite amount of time would need to have passed. This is not possible because there is no ‘amount’ of infinity. This is a major problem. Everything that begins to exist in the universe is caused by something preceding it. If, however, there is an infinite regress of causation, then that series never has a starting point, because ∞ + 1 = ∞. We would have never reached the point in this series that we are now at if it were infinite. These paradoxes show that an infinite regress of temporal phenomena is impossible, and so establish P2.

#### Revised

P1: The universe is composed of temporal phenomena that are ordered in time

P2: An infinite regress of temporal phenomena is impossible

C1: The universe must have a beginning

P3: Everything that begins to exist has a cause

C2: There is a cause of the universe

P2 claims that the universe hasn’t always existed - if it has, then the temporal sequence is infinite. If this is impossible, then C1 follows (i.e. the universe must have a beginning). But why does it follow? Why can’t the universe be infinite or to be part of an infinite series?

**Key point:** The Kalam argument rests on the claim that **1)** an actual infinite (e.g. the universe existing for an infinite time) is impossible, and **2)** that something can;t come out of nothing (known as the causal principle).
</br>

### Explain two differences between a temporal cause and a sustaining cause

A **temporal cause** brings about its affects afterwards, whereas a **sustaining cause** brings about its effect continuously. Likewise, a temporal cause’s effect can continue after the cause ceases, but a sustaining cause’s effect depends on the continued existence and operation of the cause.





#### Revised

Whereas a temporal cause brings about effects that follow the cause (and can continue after the cause has ceased), a sustaining cause brings about its effects continuously, the effect depending on the continued existence and operation of the cause.

N.B. in the first two ways, Aquinas focuses on the causal dependencies of sustaining causation rather than temporal causation

</br>

### Outline and explain Aquinas’ second way

P1: In the world, we find sustaining causes and effects.





P2: Nothing can depend causally on itself. To do this, it would need to be able to sustain its own existence, and for this to happen it must already exist.

P3: Sustaining causes follow a logical order: the first sustains the second, the second the third, and so on.

P4: If you remove a cause, you remove its effect

C1: Therefore, if there is no first cause, there can be no other causes

P5: If there is an infinite regress of causes, there is no first cause

C2: Therefore, given that there are sustaining causes, there cannot be an infinite regress of causes

C3: Therefore, there must be a first cause which is not itself caused

P6: God is the first cause

C4: Therefore, God exists


Aquinas’ reasoning behind P6 (i.e. God is the first cause) is that our concept of natural things is that they are causally dependent, and their existence is not self-sufficient. This contrasts with our concept of God, a part of which is that god does not depend on anything for his existence. There are no (obvious) similar concepts, and so it makes sense that God is the first cause, because nothing else can be.

#### Revised

P1: We can observe sustaining causes and effects in the world (this is an empirical claim)

P2: Nothing can causally depend on itself (to do so it would have to be self-sustaining, which would mean it existed before it existed)

P3: (Sustaining) causes follow logical order: first causally sustains second, which sustains third, etc.

P4: To remove a cause removes the effect (of that cause)

C1: If there is no first (sustaining) cause then there will be no other causes

**N.B. To explain why there is something, and not nothing, a first sustaining cause is needed**

P5: If there is an infinite regress of causes then there is no first cause

C2: Given that there are (sustaining) causes, there cannot be an infinite regrets of causes

C3: There must be an uncaused first cause

P6: God is the first cause

C4: God exists

</br>

### Outline and explain Aquinas’ first way, with reference to Aquinas’ concept of motion and the point that Aquinas is not talking about temporal causes

Aquinas’ First way is based around ‘motion’, by which Aquinas means ‘change’, i.e. how properties change from one thing to another. He understands change in terms of ‘actuality’ and ‘potentiality’: when a change occurs, something that was potential becomes actual, e.g. when water is heated, the cold water starts with the potential to become hot under the right conditions. When heated, this changes, because its potential to be hot is replaced by the water actually being hot.





If this is what Aquinas means by ‘motion’, then a mover is what causes this change. This mover must itself be actual to bring about a change in something else from potential to actual.

Now that this is established, we can state Aquinas’ argumnent:

P1: Some things in the world undergo change

P2: Whatever changes is changed by something, i.e. change is caused. The cause must be something else. Something potential can only be made actual by something that is already actual. 

P3: If $A$ is changed by $B$, and $B$ is changed, then $B$ must have been changed by something else again

P4: If this goes on to infinity, then there is no first cause of change

P5: To remove a cause is to remove its effect

P6: Therefore, if there is no first cause, then there are no other causes - nothing changes

C1: Therefore, there must be a first cause

P7: The first cause is God

C2: Therefore, God exists


The best understanding of this argument is that Aquinas is not talking in terms of temporal causes. He isn’t concerned with these dependencies being changed from potential to actual *temporally* - rather, his thought is that whatever is only potential depends on what is actual. Each thing that changes, was, at some point, potential. As long as we explain change in terms of other things that change, the account is incomplete. To complete our account, we need to finding something that does not change, i.e. that is entirely actual. This is something that is *ontologically prior*.

#### Revised

P1: We observe that some things in the world undergo change

P2: Whatever changes is changed by something (i.e. change is caused)

P3: If $A$ is changed by $B$, and $B$ is changed, then $B$ must have been changed by something else ($C$)

P4: If this process goes onto infinity, then there is no first cause of change

P5: To remove a cause removes the effect (of that cause)

P6: So, if there is not first cause, then there are no further causes, and so nothing changes

C1: There must be a first cause

P7: The first cause of change is God

C2: God exists


N.B. The idea of a ‘first cause of change’ is the idea of something actual (‘fully itself’) rather than something that has the potential to become actual. This is Aristotelian language: the first cause is an ‘unmoved mover’ - the cause of motion that is itself uncaused. Aquinas is not talking about temporal causes (the domino analogy is not useful). Rather, Aquinas’ idea is a conceptual one: that whatever is only potential (e.g. an acorn) must depend on something that *is* actual (e.g. an oak tree).

### Outline and explain Descartes’ cosmological argument

P1: If I cause my own existence, I would give myself all perfections





P2: I do not have all perfections

C1: Therefore, I cannot be the cause of my own existence

P3: A lifespan is composed of independent parts, such that my existence at one time does not entail nor cause my existence in future

C2: Therefore, a cause is needed to keep me in existence, because my existence is not uncaused

P4: I do not have the power to cause my continued existence

C3: Therefore, I must depend on something else to exist

P5: I am a thinking thing and I have the idea of God

P6: There must be as much reality in the cause as in the effect

C4: Therefore, what caused me must be a thinking thing and have the idea of God

P7: Either what caused me is the cause of its own existence, or its existence is caused by another cause

P8: If this existence is caused by another cause, then its cause is either the cause of its own existence, or its existence is caused by another caused.

P9: There cannot be an infinite sequence of causes

C5: Some cause must therefore be the cause of its own existence

P10: This cause must be god

C6: God exists

**Descartes supports C2 by arguing that:**

P11: There cannot be an infinite chain of causes, because what caused me also causes my continued existence in the present

P12: My parents, or any other temporal cause of my existence, do not keep me in existence

P10 (Again): The only cause that could keep me in existence is God

C6: God exists

#### Revised

Descartes contends that his existence *depends* on the existence of something else, and that as a thinking thing with an idea of perfection/God, what caused him must also be a thinking thing with an idea of God (P6). He rejects the possibility of an infinite regress of causes (P9), concluding that there must be a being the existence of which is not caused or sustained by anything else (i.e. that is a first cause and self-sustaining). That being is God.

**5 Stages of the Argument**

1) If I was self-created, I would create myself with all perfections; I do not possess all perfections, and so I cannot be self-created.
2) My lifespan comprises independent stages that don’t necessarily lead into one another, so some cause is required to sustain me through the stages; I don’t have the power to sustain myself, so I must depend on something else.
3) I am a thinking thing with the idea of God; there must be as much reality in the cause as in the effect, so my cause must be a thinking thing with the idea of God
4) There are two options: either my cause is itself uncaused, or it is caused by something else (and so on, infinitely). There cannot be an infinite regress of causes, and so my cause must be self-caused
5) What is self-caused is God, so God must exist.

</br>

There is a further argument: picking up on the claim that some cause is needed to keep me in existence, Descartes argues that there cannot be an infinite regress of causes because what caused me must be what sustains my existence: my parents are not a sustaining cause; so only God could sustain me; He does, so He must exist.

</br>

### Explain why Descartes claims that his continued existence requires a cause

Something must make it true, rather than false, that he continues to exist. Whatever his continued existence is dependent on must itself continue to exist.





#### Revised

The fact that Descartes exists at T1 does not entail that he continues to exist at T2. So, something must make it true that he continues to exist. As with all sustaining causes, whatever the cause of his continued existence is must itself continue to exist.
</br>

### Outline two similarities between Descartes’ cosmological argument and Aquinas’ second way

One similarity is the claim that the universe has a cause, and does not exist uncaused. Another is that an infinite regress of causes is impossible.





#### Revised

1) The universe has a cause external to itself (this is the causal principle)
2) An infinite series of causes is impossible

</br>

### Explain Hume’s objection to the causal principle

Hume objects that the claim ‘everything (i.e. everything that begins to exist must have a cause’ is not an analytic truth (in Hume’s terms, it is not a relation of ideas, but a matter of fact). In other words, we cannot establish that it is true without exception. This contrasts with the claim that ‘every effect must have a cause’: this is an analytic truth/relation of ideas in that the idea of being caused is contained within the idea of an effect by definition - we can establish its truth by reflecting on the idea of an ‘effect’ - we don’t need to go into the world and prove it by observation.





The response to Hume is to accept that cosmological arguments don’t prove God’s existence as a necessity, however even Hume accepts that we have very good reasons to suppose that everything has a cause. As a result, the reply says, we have good reason to suppose that the causal principle holds and so have good reason to rely on conclusions that follow.

</br>

### Does the possibility of an infinite regress undermine the cosmological argument?

The cosmological argument relies on the claim that an infinite regress of causes is impossible. Hume asks whether this *is* impossible? For example, even if the universe began, the Kalam argument does not show that an infinite series of causes across multiple universes is impossible.





Alternatively, we can apply Hume’s fork, arguing that we cannot know (as a matter of fact) that an infinite regress of causes is impossible (i.e. the claim that there cannot be an infinite regress of causes is not a relation of ideas/analytic truth).

Or, we can argue that our inability to grasp an infinite regress is simply the result of a lack of human understanding (specifically an inability to grasp the concept of infinity).

</br>

### Explain Aquinas’ third way

The third way distinguishes between contingent and necessary existence.





P1: We observe that things exist contingently

P2: If its possible for $x$ not to exist, then at some time it does not exist

C1: If everything exists contingently then it is possible that at some time, nothing existed

P3: If at some time nothing existed, nothing can begin to exist

C2: Since things do exist, there was never nothing in existence

C3: There is something that does not exist contingently but must exist

P4: That necessary being is God

C4: God exists

**N.B. Kant argues that this premise is only justified if we have already established God’s existence via the ontological argument** 

</br>

### Is Aquinas right to claim that everything contingent does not exist at some point?

Just because it is possible for $x$ not to exist does not entail that it *actually* does not exist at some point. Aquinas’ reply is that P2 is justified because everything in our experience comes into and passes out of existence. Aquinas might also reply that there was something that always existed that wasn’t at the same time necessary, then we would need a very particular explanation of it (not least because it corresponds with nothing in our existence).





</br>

### Outline and explain leibniz’s cosmological argument from contingency

**Key point:** leibniz argues that every true fact about the nature of reality needs a *sufficient reason* for why it is true. Explanations of contingent truths about the nature of reality that refer to other contingent truths don’t meet this criterion - i.e. they don’t provide a sufficient reason, because these contingent facts require explanation in their turn. And so, (in conclusion), what provides an explanation of contingent truths must itself exist necessarily. And that explanation is God.





</br>

### Explain Russel’s objection that the argument from contingency commits the fallacy of composition

The fallacy of composition states that because the parts have property $x$ then the whole must have property $x$ as well. Accordingly, Russel claims that by explaining one contingent thing in terms of another we don’t have a sufficient reason until we can explain all contingent things. In short, we cannot infer from the contingent existence of each thing in the universe that the universe itself is contingent.





The reply to the fallacy of composition accusation is to reject it on the grounds that if everything in the universe ceased to exist, so would the universe itself. So the universe does exist contingently and requires an explanation. 

</br>

### Explain Hume’s objection

Hume objects that, while we may search for explanations of why the universe exists, it is not an analytic truth that everything has an explanation of its existence.





A possible reply is that leibniz’s argument (and the cosmological argument generally) nevertheless works as an inference to the ‘best explanation’ (amongst those available).

Hume/Russell respond to this that the concept of a being that exists necessarily is an incoherent concept, so the conclusion (as in Leibniz’s argument) that such a being exists is necessarily false.

A final possible reply on behalf of Leibniz is that Hume/Russell misunderstand ‘necessary existence’. They offer no categorical reason why it is impossible for a being to exist necessarily. Instead, the cosmological argument from contingency provides a reason (best explanation) to think that such a being does exist.

Eventually, it comes down to whether you think that the existence of the universe demands an explanation. if you do, then the cosmological argument from contingency supplies a reason for thinking that God (necessary being) exists. But maybe you don’t think that the existence of the universe demands an explanation that the universe is simply a ‘brute fact’ (Russell)
