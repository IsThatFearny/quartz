# What is Mill's Qualitative Utilitarianism? (Revised from Prep)

</br>

## a) Mill's defence and clarification of Utilitarianism
</br>

### How does Mill account for the lack of agreement on the criterion for right and wrong?
Mill says that, while it is often not recognised, the concept of Utility often significantly influences the formation of moral beliefs. This means that specific criterion for 'right' and 'wrong' may not be as important in utilitarianism as they may be in other normative ethical theories.

##### Revised
Mill observes that whilst humankind seems by the mid-19th century to be making all sorts of scientific and technological progress, the discussion about morality does not seem to have advanced much since the Greeks. He accounts for this as follows: whereas in science we can apply the inductive method - from particular cases we can establish general laws (of nature) - this is difficult to apply to ethics - we can't proceed from particular cases to general moral principles because we need prior agreement of what the principles are to judge the particular cases.
</br>


### How does Mill reply to the following objections/misunderstandings of Utilitarianism?

#### That Utilitarianism 'ignores the value of pleasure'?

A common misunderstanding is that 'Utility' means usefulness and not pleasure, and therefore Utilitarianism ignores the value of pleasure. Mill defends this by reasserting Bentham's claims: that 'actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness'; 'by happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain and the privation of pleasure'; and 'Pleasure, and freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as ends'

#### That Utilitarianism is redundant because 'we do not need happiness'?
Mill defends this objection by stating that this is irrelevant, as the sacrifice of happiness is virtuous when done for the happiness of others. The argument used in *Philosophy for AS and A Level, pp.210, Lacewing* is that 'Many wise and noble people have lived without [happiness]'. This is followed by an explanation of how said wise and noble people have sacrificed their happiness for others, and that the aim of Utilitarianism 'remains to increase the total happiness in the world'

#### That 'Utilitarians make right or wrong depend upon the agent's happiness'?

Mill defends this by saying that the criterion of right action is the happiness of everyone, and therefore we should organise society in a way that each person feels happy when making others happy

#### That Utilitarianism is a 'godless theory'?
Mill states that Utilitarianism is not a godless theory, as it can be made compatible with religious teachings (Mill mentions only Christianity due to his social context)

#### That Utilitarianism 'will lead to people sacrificing moral principles for 'expedient' moral action'

If an action is 'expedient' (in an individual's interest or in the short-term interest) then Utilitarianism condemns it, if it sacrifices the greater happiness for immediate or self gratification.

## b) Mill's Qualitative Utilitarianism

</br>

### How does Mill understand happiness (with specific reference to the happiness pleasure relation)?
Mill agrees with Bentham that happiness is 'pleasure and the absence of pain'. However, he defines happiness in a more complex way, stating that happiness is not 'a continuity of highly pleasurable excitement, but moments of such, in a existence made up of few and transitory pains, [and] many and various pleasures'

##### Revised
Mill is a hedonist (pleasure and the absence of pain), but whereas Bentham characterises happiness as 'a continuity of highly pleasurable excitement', Mill says that happiness is 'moments of such, in an existence made up of few and transitory pains'.

</br>

### Is such pleasure attainable?
Mill says that yes, when happiness is understood like his, it is certainly attainable. He argues that the main obstacles are a poor education and a poor social arrangement. He states that we can't always expect pleasure and happiness, but suffering is something that we can diminish over time

##### Revised
This, Mill argues, is a more 'realistic', attainable conception of happiness, given the situations in which humans ordinarily exist - i.e. the obstacles they often face, such as limited education, lack of opportunity and inequality, bad luck, etc. (which we can diminish over time if society is organised on a utilitarian basis)
</br>

### Does Utilitarianism degrade humans in valuing only pleasure?

Mill claims that this argument misunderstands what humans take pleasure in. He says that there are 'higher' and 'lower' pleasures, higher pleasures being more 'valuable' than lower ones.

##### Revised
Mill responds by sympathising with the criticism: as formulated by Bentham, focusing entirely on an idea of pleasure, as 'excitement', there is the danger that humans are treated as merely sensual creatures on the same level as animals (for whom all pleasure is about physical excitement). So, Mill says, we need to recognise the difference between humans and animals - specifically that humans have the capacity for emotional and intellectual pleasures unavailable to animals that calls for a more sophisticated understanding of pleasure than Bentham provides.
</br>

### Describe Mill's distinction between higher and lower pleasures
Mill distinguishes between higher and lower pleasure using quality instead of quantity (hence 'qualitative utilitarianism')

##### Revised
So, Mill distinguishes between 'higher' human capabilities that separate us from animals - this leads him to contrast between higher and lower pleasures corresponding to these capabilities

Hence the 'higher-lower pleasures' distinction.
Lower pleasures are those associated with physical/sensual gratification e.g. quenching thirst, the sweetness of sugar, sex, warm shower, etc.
Higher pleasures are those associated with the gratification of our higher emotional and intellectual capabilities, e.g. pleasures of maths, literature, love, music, etc
</br>

### Explain Mill's test for higher pleasures
Mill distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures by using a test. 'If everyone who has experience of two types of pleasures prefers one to the other, then the type that they prefer is more valuable' (*Lacewing, Philosophy for AS and A-Level, pp.213*). He also adds another condition to this: 'A pleasure is higher only if people who have experience of both types of pleasure prefer one even if having that pleasure brings more pain with it, or if they would choose it over a greater quantity of the other type of pleasure.' (*Lacewing, Philosophy for AS and A-Level, pp.213*)

##### Revised
- 'Test of competent judges' - only the competent judge can distinguish/determine the higher from lower pleasures by virtue of having extensively experienced both types of pleasure (i.e. they can make a qualitative distinction between the two) 

The competent judge will prefer their choice (of the higher) even if the higher pleasure in question involves a certain amount of pain (e.g. better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all (but merely to have restricted oneself to one night stands))
</br>

### How are humans different to pigs, according to Mill?
Mill states that valuing only pleasure is 'a doctrine worthy only of a swine'. By this, he means that human beings are able to experience pleasure in a much more complex way than a pig is able to. Mill also states that 'it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied', adding that this statement derives from our sense of dignity, which is an integral part of our happiness

##### Revised
'Better a human satisfied than a pig dissatisfied' - humans differ from pigs on account of possessing different emotional/intellectual capacities, which brings with it the capacity for greater and more complicated pains - hence 'better a human...' because without the capacity for greater pain, we cannot have the capacity for greater pleasure
</br>

### How does Mill reply to the criticism that humans do not reliably choose higher over lower pleasures (with reference to how we distinguish between higher and lower)?

Mill argues that there is a difference between preference and action. We can still recognise that an alternative forgone may have been the more valuable action. Mill also argues that we may seek lower pleasures because they are more readily available to us, and seeking higher pleasures is more demanding and time-consuming. In addition, Mill says that pleasures may only be defined by the thoughts and opinions of those who are 'completely acquainted' with the pleasure being defined

##### Revised
Potential problem with Mill's test - if it proves to be the case that those with experience of higher and lower pleasures in the event choose lower pleasures to pursue; then higher pleasures aren't in truth higher at all.

Mill responds that the criticism does not apply - he makes a distinction between 'preference' and 'action' - i.e. what we know to be more valuable and what we end up actually doing. The reason we might not act in accordance with what we know would be of greater value is laziness/weakness of will (unless pleasure is not readily available)
