# Kantian Deontological Ethics

</br>

## What is Deontology?

</br>

### Explain the nature of Deontology, with reference to the concept of duty

In essence, Deontology says that morality is a matter of duty ('deon' is the Greek word for duty). We have moral duties which are right to do and actions that it is our duty not to do. Judging the right and wrongness of actions is not a matter of consequences, but inherent in the action itself.

Deontological theories tend to distinguish two types of duties: 1) general duties we have towards everyone; 2) duties based on personal/social relationships.

Duties pertain to our actions - I have a duty to keep my promises - our concern should be with keeping our duties (not bringing about the most good). 

N.B. Thus, we might say that Deontology is focused on what is 'right', not what is 'good'.
</br>

### Explain the relation between intention and action in Deontology

Because consequences are irrelevant to the right/wrongness of an action, the agent's intentions are central (e.g. the act of killing has a very different moral status if the act was intended rather than if it was an accident or intended but in self-defence).

So, understanding actions as the product of choices is key, specifically choices based on reasons - what was the agent's reasoning (and this intention)?

</br>

### What are the similarities and differences between Deontology and Act Utilitarianism?

- Similarities
	- Like Utilitarianism, Kantian Deontology focuses on the moral qualities of actions ('which is the moral action?')
	- Both believe that morality is a matter of rational calculation (rather than feelings/emotions)
- Differences
	- Whereas Utilitarianism calculates the moral value of action in terms of consequences (what will lead to the happiest outcome?), Kant argues that consequences are completely irrelevant to whether an action is moral.
	- Utilitarianism focuses on what is 'good', whereas Deontology focuses on what is 'right'


</br>

## What is Kant's account of the good will and duty?

</br>

### Explain Kantian Deontology, with reference to maxims, principles and the will

Maxims - The intention behind an action is captured in the maxim on which we are acting. So, whenever we act, we act on a maxim - a principle, as in' to make as much money as possible.

Principles - Morality is a set of principles binding on everyone

The will - Our ability to make rational choices/decisions. Our actions are the rest of our choices - we do not simply act on instinct, Kant argues

</br>

### Explain Kant's concept of the 'good will'

The will is our ability to make rational choices, and the 'good will' is the will that is 'good without qualification' - that is to say, inherently good. So, the good will is the will that always makes morally right choices motivated by duty alone (and not other reasons such as self-interest, etc.) - the 'disinterested choice' (N.B. 'disinterested', not 'uninterested'). It is not that we do not care about our action in the sense of lacking self-interest, rather that the choice in accordance with duty achieves impartiality. It sets all personal interests aside. In short, the good will is the will motivated by duty alone
</br>

### Explain Kant's claim that the 'good will' is good 'in itself' or 'without qualification'

The good will is good 'in itself' or 'without qualification'. What is 'good' about the good will has nothing to do with what it achieves, (i.e. outcomes/consequences). Rather, intentions are paramount: an action is morally right if it is properly motivated - success (outcome) is not relevant.
</br>

### What is Kant's distinction between acting in accordance with duty and acting out of duty?

Acting out of duty: to have a good will is to be motivated by duty - acting for the sake of duty alone - acting out of duty.

Acting in accordance with duty: undertaking the same action as the person acting out of duty, but not for its own sake, instead for self-interest, e.g. the shopkeeper who does not short-change his customers because it is wrong to do so Vs the shopkeeper who does not short-change his customers for fear of being caught and losing his business.
