### Is Indirect Realism the correct theory of perception?

#### Overview

- Indirect realism claims that we perceive mind-independent physical objects via mind-dependent sense-data, which are caused by and represent physical objects. Sense-data is perceived directly and immediately, and physical objects indirectly.
- Sense-data are mental things which are the way we perceive them to be. They can only exist whilst being experienced, and are private. No one else can experience your sense data.

#### Veil of Perception leads to scepticism about the external world

- If we cannot perceive physical objects directly, and can only perceive sense-data representations of physical objects, how can we be sure of the nature of the external world, or even of its existence? We cannot, and therefore indirect realism fails in claiming that there is a mind-independent external world, a central claim of the theory.
- Russel defends Indirect Realism by arguing that the existence of the external world is the best hypothesis. He provides two reasons as to why, but rejects the first on the grounds that it begs the question. His revised defence is as such: Either physical objects exist and cause my sense data, or physical objects do not exist and thus do not cause my sense data. Neither claim is provable. I must therefore treat them as hypotheses. The former hypothesis is better, and therefore physical objects exist and cause my sense data.
- Locke, Trotter Cockburn all provide responses in support of Russel’s conclusion. Locke’s is from the involuntary nature of our perception. He argues that we cannot avoid having certain sense-data in our eyes. Perceptual experiences must be caused by something outside of our own minds, and these must be physical objects. Trotter Cockburn’s argument is from coherence, namely that one and the same object cause perceptual experiences through different senses (e.g. if I see a fire, and touch the fire and burn my hand, I can conclude that the fire is really there.)

#### Our belief in physical objects remains a hypothesis

- If indirect realism is correct, then it seems that the existence of physical objects remains a hypothesis, something that we have to infer. This is a significant weakness. It could be that we are not aware of an alternative hypothesis. Further, it is entirely counter-intuitive to argue that perception doesn’t  put us in direct touch with physical objects. If we have to infer the existence of the external world, then we are not open to the world in perception.
- The Indirect Realist’s response to this is a rejection of Russel, Locke, and Trotter Cockburn’s theories. They write as if sense-data come between us and the external world. However, we should say that sense-data is the medium through which we perceive physical objects. They do not lock our access to the external world. Thus, the existence of the external world is not a hypothesis, but is something we experience in perception.
- This response can be challenged, however, as it doesn’t address the fact that sense-data differ from the objects that they represent. But this is explicable in terms of physical objects and their effects on us, and only in these terms. The best explanation of illusions and perceptual variation needs both sense-data and physical objects. 

#### Issues with resemblance of sense-data

- Locke claims that physical objects ‘resemble’ our sense-data. This raises the question of what are physical objects really like? Locke’s answer to this question is his primary and secondary quality distinction. Secondary qualities are nothing like how physical objects are in themselves, however our experience shows that physical objects in themselves have primary qualities which we can experience.
- However, we cannot rule out the claim that physical objects cause our experiences of these qualities but don’t resemble these experiences at all.
- Berkeley questioned Locke’s claim, arguing that because of perceptual variation, we can ask how our sense-data, which is ‘fleeting and variable’ resemble a physical object that is supposedly ‘fixed and constant’? Further, Berkeley argues that we do not experience physical objects directly, and therefore something that we do not experience cannot be like something that is experienced. The only idea of an object that we have comes from our experience. If Indirect Realism is true, Berkeley concludes, then we can’t know the nature of mind-independent objects.
- The Indirect Realist response to this is that we can still argue that sense-data represent physical objects, just don’t resemble them. The relation between the external world and our sense-data is very detailed and systematic.
- However, this does not answer the objection, because causes and effects can be very different, and thus if we understand representation in terms of systematic relations, it seems that we still cannot known what mind-independent objects are like in themselves.

### Is Innatism the correct theory of reason as a source of knowledge?

#### Overview

- Innatism is the claim that we have innate concepts which are ‘imprinted onto our souls at birth’. We are able to ‘unlock’ this knowledge through experience

#### Plato and Leibniz’s arguments

- Plato proposes the ‘Meno’s slave’ example, which demonstrates that we can have knowledge of something (in this case, basic geometry) without experience. Plato argues that this is innate knowledge
- Liebniz argues that necessary truths cannot be derived from our experience, since experience can only teach us how things at a given moment, and cannot tell us about how things must be. We can discover innate knowledge (a priori knowledge of necessary truths) by ‘attending carefully and methodically to what is already in our minds’. Leibniz argues that innate knowledge is foundational which can be discovered and built upon by sense experience

- Locke opposes these arguments. He understands innate knowledge as universal and conscious. He argues that children and ‘idiots’ cannot understand certain claims (e.g. geometry as in Meno’s slave). Thus, these claims are not universal and are not, therefore, innate. Locke argues that there are in fact *no* claims that are universally accepted, and therefore there can be no innate knowledge

- Liebniz’s response to Locke is that he has not understood innate knowledge. He is wrong to claim that an idea can only be in the mind if we are conscious of it - it can also be unconscious: there is knowledge that we can have ‘without explicitly attending to it’, for example the claim that ‘it is impossible to something to be and not to be’. This kind of concept is necessary for thought, even when it is unconscious. The same is true for memory.

- Locke can accept this, but argue that it is irrelevant to innate knowledge because memory simply recalls what is conscious.

- But, asks Liebniz, why should we accept that all unconscious knowledge should be gained from experience?

#### Innate concepts

- We cannot have propositional knowledge without knowledge of concepts, and the same applies to innate knowledge
- Locke raises three objections to innate concepts: 1) Newborn babies have no concepts beyond their experiences in the womb; 2) God is not an innate concept; and 3) concepts can only be unconscious if they are lodged in our memory
- Liebniz in turn responds to these: 1) We have a disposition to form concepts such as identity at birth, but it takes time for them to be fully and explicitly formed in our minds; 2) Languages and concepts are not the same, not having the language to talk about God is the same as not having the concept of a higher being; and 3) Innate concepts are not new or remembered, but are dispositions which we may not always be conscious of until they are triggered.

#### Tabula Rasa

- Locke proposes an alternative empiricist theory - that our minds are *tabula rasa* at birth, and experience imprints our knowledge upon our minds.
- Locke argues that there are two sources of knowledge: sensation, which is our experience of objects outside the mind as perceived by the senses; and reflection, which is our experience of the internal operation of our minds, gained through introspection
- Hume argues that what we are immediately and directly aware of are ‘perceptions’. These can either be categorised into ‘impressions’ and ‘ideas’. Hume divides impressions into the same categories as Locke. The distinction between impressions and ideas, he says, is that impressions roughly relate to feeling, and ideas to thinking. He says that ideas are copies of impressions, and we are liable to confuse and make mistakes about ideas, but this is more difficult with impressions. Hume’s ‘ideas’ can also be referred to as concepts.
- Hume therefore corrects Locke’s theory slightly: we use copies of impressions in thinking
- Hume argues that all ideas derive from impressions, using two arguments: the first is that a person lacks the ability to form an idea of an experience without having that experience. His second argument is that the basic building blocks of all thought are simple impressions. These ‘contain nothing but one uniform appearance or conception in the mind, and are not distinguishable into different ideas’. These simple concepts can be used to construct more complex concepts, either by combination or abstraction (i.e. the concept dog doesn’t correspond to one singular dog).
- Hume claims that all concepts can be analysed into simple concepts, each of which corresponds to an impression. Therefore, all concepts ultimately derive from experience, and innatism must be false.

- We can challenge the notion that we cannot form a concept without relevant experience. For example, a person may imagine a missing shade of blue in a colour spectrum. Hume dismisses this exception, but it is important. If this is a possibility, is it not also a possibility that we could form other ideas without copying them from impressions? If it is, then his theory fails.
- There are two possible solutions that fit within Hume’s philosophy: the copy principle can be weakened to say that ‘any ideas that are not copied from impressions are only meaningful if they *could* be copied from impressions’; or we can maintain the copy principle but explain why this missing shade of blue is an exception - the simple impressions of different shades of blue are related, and can be arranged according to relations. Thus, we can argue that the missing shade could be imagined based upon other similar impressions that we already have.

### Is Reliabilism a sound theory of knowledge?

#### Intro

- Reliabilism is sound/not sound

#### Overview

- Reliabilism is the theory of knowledge that claims we have knowledge if:
	- P is true
	- S believes that P, and
	- S's belief is produced by a reliable cognitive process

A reliable cognitive process is one which produces a high proportion of true beliefs.

Reliabilism attempts to strengthen the definition of justification (instead of making it infallible). This overcomes issues where a mistake in a cognitive process accidentally produces knowledge. It also allows young children and animals to have knowledge. Whether they have justification is irrelevant, as long as they have formed their beliefs through a reliable cognitive process.

The reliabilist understands knowledge as a 'natural good' similar to beauty or strength, as it bestows benefits on the creature which possesses it.

#### Gettier Counter-examples

- There are certain Gettier cases that cause Reliabilism to fail, such as Fake Barn County - Fake barn county is an area in which there are many fake barns (that is, wooden structures made to look like barns, they are in fact only 2D). You drive into this area, unaware of the fact that you are in fake barn county. If you were to look at a 'barn', you would think 'that's a barn'. While this proposition has come about due to a reliable process (vision), it is not knowledge as it is false. However, you look at one barn in particular, think to yourself 'oh look, another barn'. this barn happens to be the only real barn in the area. This belief is true, and it has come about using a reliable process (vision). However, it is not knowledge, for as is similar in other Gettier cases, it is only by luck that this proposition has been formed. Zagzebski’s ‘Dr Jones and the Virus’ counterexample has a similar result
- Therefore, Reliabilism fails to account for these examples and fails to an extent

#### No analysis of knowledge that adds conditions to true beliefs can escape gettier cases

Zagzebski says that as long as the third condition (No false lemmas, reliable process, etc.) is independent of truth, we will always be able to construct Gettier examples that show that this definition of knowledge is incorrect. Zagzebski argues that in a 'good' definition of knowledge, we must demonstrate how truth and the third condition are connected, and not just added on to each other. Therefore Reliabilism cannot be a satisfactory definition of knowledge




### Kantian Deontology

#### Intro

- Deontology is sound/not sound

#### Overview

- Deontology is the claim that actions are inherently right or wrong, based upon the intention of the agent
- Kant argues that in making a decision, we act on a maxim - a general rule that guides our actions
- Morality is defined as a set of principles that are universal
- The ability to make choices and decisions is defined as ‘the will’. We act based upon reasoning and choice. Only the ‘good will’ is good without qualification, because it is a precondition to deserving happiness, and because it does not depend upon a good outcome for its goodness.

#### The Categorical Imperative + Debate

- The Categorical Imperative (the first formulation) is the principle that you should ‘act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law’
- A maxim cannot be universalised if there is either a contradiction in conception or a contradiction in will. A contradiction in conception is the situation in which everyone acting upon a maxim is self-contradictory. For example, if one were to attempt to universalise the maxim ‘To steal whatever I want’. If everyone acted on this maxim, then the concept of private property would cease to exist, as would the idea of stealing, and so the maxim cannot be realised. A contradiction in will is the situation in which a maxim is not contradictory when universalised, but we cannot rationally will it. For example, we cannot rationally will that no-one ever helps anyone else. This is because this is a situation in which we cease to will the means to our ends. It contradicts the very act of willing. It is possible that the only available means to our ends is by the help of others, and therefore willing against this is irrational.

- The second formulation of the categorical imperative is to ‘act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as an end’. Further, Kant argues that we must also adopt the ends of others as our own. To treat someone as a means is to undermine their rational choice.

- One objection to Kant’s categorical imperative is that there are some maxims which can be universalised, but would be considered ‘wrong’. For example, I can formulate a maxim ‘to only steal from market stalls selling novelty umbrellas on Wednesdays’. This maxim can be universalised because the situation in which it would be used occurs so rarely that there is no contradiction. Kant’s response is that his Deontology is only concerned with the actual maxim that is underlying - if I am honest with myself, I have to admit that the maxim which I am acting upon is ‘to steal something if I can’t afford it’, which is of course not universalisable. Another counterexample that is more successful is the maxim ‘to make a promise I don’t intend to keep rather than ask for help, but only in dire straits’. This can be universalised, because it would not occur often enough to cause a contradiction, but the action is still wrong. Here, the categorical imperative fails to give us the right answer, and it is thus not always right to do something that is universalisable.

#### Conflicts between duties

- Kant asserts that moral duties are absolute and cannot be compromised
- This seemingly causes a problem for deontology, because if two duties conflict - e.g. breaking a promise vs telling a lie - then Kant provides no way to resolve the conflict
- Kant responds by arguing that a *real* conflict of duties never occurs - if it seems like there is a conflict, then we have misunderstood what at least one of the maxims is asking of us. We must formulate maxims very carefully to avoid conflict. We can object further by arguing that it is more realistic to say that most duties are not absolute, and therefore we can prioritise ‘more important’ duties over ‘less important’ ones. This is at odds with Kant’s entire theory.

#### Moral Value

- The Utilitarianism objection to deontology is that it is confused about moral value - if there is a duty not to murder, then there must be something wrong with murder. And if murder is bad, then surely we should try our best to prevent it. If the outcome of not killing one person is that others will die, then we cannot justify *not* killing that person. In this case, it seems that I have a duty to kill, because what makes a will good is that it wills good ends (i.e. the survival of those spared). Kant responds by arguing that there are no ends that are good without qualification, and so this cannot be the correct analysis of the good will.

### Aristotelian Virtue Ethics

</br>

#### Intro

- Aristotelian virtue ethics is sound/not sound

#### Overview

- Aristotle argues that ‘the good’ i.e. the aim of all activities is *eudaimonia* or ‘flourishing’. Eudaimonia is a final end, i.e. an end that is sought for its own sake. It is the only finalend that we seek purely for its own sake
- Our *ergon* (i.e. function or characteristic activity) is to live as a rational being. Our good, therefore, is the activity which exhibits the virtues by being in accordance with right reason.
- Eudaimonia requires wealth, because we must have some good fortune in order for us to practise virtuous activity
- A ‘virtue’ is the mean of two vices, e.g. the mean of having a short fuse and being too calm is being level-headed, and therefore this is a virtue
- A fully virtuous act is one in which the agent is aware of what they are doing, chooses the act for its own sake, and makes their choice from a firm and unchangeable character
- Therefore, virtues are formed through habits that we acquire whilst growing up. To achieve eudaimonia we must achieve expertise that allows us not only to follow precedent but to create our own solution to a given situation
- Thus, practical wisdom cannot be taught - it requires experience

#### Issue 1

- The definition of practical wisdom in relation to virtuosity seems to be circular: we cannot have virtue without also having practical wisdom, yet cannot achieve practical wisdom without virtue. This implies that eudaimonia is only accessible to those who are born with both, which is no one, and therefore eudaimonia cannot logically be achieved.

#### Issue 2: Guidance on how to act

- A common question that is asked of Aristotelian virtue ethics is whether it can actually provide us with helpful guidance on how to act. 
- It can be argued that ‘too much’ and ‘too little’ are not quantifiable on any scale, and therefore are of very little use in deciding exactly how to act. For example, it gives us no information on how often we should get angry, nor any advice on how angry we should get. We could justify any response to a situation if the circumstances were right
	- One response to this is that Aristotle did not intend the doctrine of the mean to be used in this way: Aristotle intended for us to use practical wisdom in order to determine what the ‘mean’ actually is.
	- There is a counterresponse too, which argues that this simply redefines our doubt: can practical wisdom be of any use in deciding how to act? For those who possess it, perhaps. But for those who don’t, it would see, that it is unattainable: we acquire practical wisdom through performing virtuous actions. We only know that these are virtuous actions because we exercise practical wisdom in determining that these actions are what a virtuous person would do. But we cannot determine this, and therefore cannot perform these actions in virtuous ways, and in turn cannot acquire practical wisdom through experience, without having practical wisdom in the first place.
- This argument, however, views virtue ethics in too rigid a structure. The intention is not to provide a set of rules (as deontology attempts to do), but to guide practical wisdom. Therefore, practical wisdom can indeed provide us with helpful guidance on how to act.

#### Issue 3: Conflicts between virtues

- It can be asked whether we can display two conflicting virtues, or whether we have to choose one or the other. Aristotle’s position is the same as Kant’s: he denies that conflicts ever occur between virtues. He argues that with practical wisdom, we can find a path of action that satisfies the demand of each relevant virtue. If, for example, you think that mercy requires injustice, or justice demands mercilessness, then you have misunderstood the concepts of justice and mercy. However, whilst Aristotle’s theory allows the swift resolution of *some* potential conflicts, because it rejects absolute rules, other counter-examples such as loyalty and dishonesty bring doubt to the forefront again.

### Applied Ethics: Telling Lies

#### Utilitarianism

- According to Mill, being truthful is of great benefit to the general happiness, as it is the basis of social wellbeing, civilisation, and of virtue more generally. To tell a lie for the sake of convenience is severely damaging to this, and thus is morally wrong.
- Mill says that lying is sometimes permissible, e.g. when it is the only way that we can prevent harm
- Rule Utilitarianism argues that the rule ‘don’t lie’ will create more happiness than a rule that permitted lying. However, never lying will lead to harm in certain situations. A rule that allows for these exceptions is hard to formulate though.

#### Deontology

- Kant rules out making a false promise as immoral because it involves a contradiction in conception, and the same applies to lying in general. The maxim cannot be universalised.
- Even if a maxim is made more specific, then it is not universalisable because, for example, a would be murderer would know that people lie when it is necessary to save a life, and therefore would not believe the lie
- Kant argues that we cannot know what consequences our lying will cause: if we were to tell the murderer that their victim had run down the street, because we believed that they were hiding in our house, but in fact they had indeed ran down the street and are subsequently murdered, Kant would say that we are responsible for this. Therefore, if we are tempted to lie because we think that the consequences would be more favourable if we did so, then it is possible that we are mistaken, and thus it is better to do our duty
- Further, Kant can argue that to lie to someone is to treat someone as a means to our own ends and thus violates the second formulation of the categorical imperative
- What seems to follow from this is that if everyone were morally good, then lying would always be wrong. However, we must sometimes protect ourselves and others from the immoral actions of others, and lying may be the only means of doing so. If an action intends to treat me as a means to an end, then we can, by lying, prevent this result.

#### Aristotelian Virtue Ethics

- Aristotle argues that lying is an act that has no mean, and is in itself wrong. Another interpretation is to argue that truth is a final end, something that we should seek for its own sake. 
- Aristotle suggests that lying is never virtuous. However, we might object that there are occasions and motives that justify lying. We can appeal to our discussion of conflicts between virtues and practical wisdom. If there are few rules in ethics, then it is unlikely that lying is always wrong. Instead, we require practical wisdom to judge when it is or isn’t justified. If we seek to deceive someone, to do so virtuously we would need to do so at the right time, with the right motive, about the right truths, and in the right way.
