# MBTIT Essay Plan for SCA

```dialogue
left: Mind-brain type identity theorist
right: Opponent of MBTIT

> Indivisibility: mind can't be identical to the brain because they have different qualities
< This assumes independent existence of minds (makes a category mistake)

> Multiple realisability of mental states: mental properties can be realised in a number of different ways (ant's pain is shown differently to human pain) so they are not identical
< This seems to overcomplicate the theory, when the very fact that brain states can be synonymous with mental states is enough

> Conceivability: it is metaphysically possible for a mental state to exist in the absence of a brain state, in which case the two are different states
< What is conceivable is not necessarily metaphysicall possible, what is metaphysically possible does not tell us about reality

> Beetle in the box: We cannot know about the universality of our experiences; mental states are private, but MBTIT assures we all have the same mental and brain states
< The meaning of mental states refers to public events (behaviours); any idea of only private mental states is a myth - we only talk meaningfully about observable brain/behavioural states

> MBTIT reduces mental states to brain states but it does not go far enough - it would be simpler to eliminate mental states entirely
< Talk about mental states is meaningful and so should not be eliminated; reduction helps us to explain the science of mental states without losing their everyday meaning

> Brain states can be physically located, wehreas mental states cannot - they are not spatial and so are different from brain states
< Not all brain states have physical properties, e.g. temperature. We do not have physical evidence for separate mental states (Occam's razor)
