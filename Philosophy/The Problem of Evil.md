# The Problem of Evil

</br>

### Explain the problem of evil as an argument against the existence of God

P1. If God is omnibenevolent, then He has the desire to eliminate evil

P2. If God is omnipotent, then He can eliminate evil

P3. If God is omniscient, then he knows that evil exists

C1. If God exists and is omniscient, omnibenevolent, and omnipotent, then He will eliminate evil

C2. If He exists, then evil does not exist

P4. Evil exists

C5. Therefore, an omni-God does not exist

</br>

### What is the difference between the logical problem of evil and the evidential problem of evil?

#### Logical (deductive)

The claim that God is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient, and that God exists is logically incompatible with the claim ‘evil exists’.

#### Evidential (inductive)

This makes a weaker claim. The amount and distribution of evil in the world is good empirical evidence that the God of the omnis does not exist.

### Explain the difference between natural and moral evil

**Moral Evil:** the morally wrong intentions and actions of autonomous (i.e. free) agents. Hector has a choice whether to destroy the world by releasing a nerve agent.

**Natural Evil:** suffering caused by naturally occurring events and processes - earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, animal predation etc.

Some occurrences of evil are potentially mixed, e.g. suffering caused by global warming is a natural process aggravated by human (moral) choices.

### Outline Mary Midgeley’s arguments that, as explanations of moral evil, neither free will nor environmental/upbringing take proper account of human nature and the complex interaction between individuals

Mary Midgeley argues that we cannot understand why people commit evil acts by appealing to a) free will, or b) environment, alone. Human nature, she argues means that humans have a capacity/potential for good, but that humans can either actualise this potential or not - ‘evil’ is the name we give to the ‘not’ - i.e. the failure to be good (this is an Aristotelian conception of evil). Moral evil is the failure to actualise our natural potential.

**Key Point:** The point is that Midgeley challenges what she views as a simplistic moral/natural distinction. Moral evil is not ‘non-natural’ evil. Rather, moral evil is the failure to fulfil our natural capacity for good.

</br>

### Explain the argument, in response to the logical problem of evil, that free will resolves the problem

The ‘free will defence’ argues that evil is the result of human free will. It is impossible for the omni-God to give us free will and make us forever choose what is good because the latter contradicts the former: free will is not free will if we cannot refrain from choosing the alternative to to what is good (i.e. God determines our choices). Thus, the existence of evil and the existence of God are not logically impossible.

</br>

### Explain the argument that determinism and free will are incompatible

Determinism is a view about causality involving the idea of regularity: that the same cause will operate the same way on different occasions. The ‘strong’ version is ‘causal necessity’. The idea of regularity leads to the ‘stronger’ version: for a given cause only one outcome/effect is possible. Does this determinism threaten free will? Does causal necessity apply as much to humans as to physical objects?

The argument:

P1. Determinism is true

C1. Our choices have causes

C2. Each choice has a particular cause in a particular situation

C3. Given those causes, no choice other than what is chosen is possible

P2. If we couldn’t make another choice then we have no freewill

C4. We don’t have free will

</br>

### Outline Midgeley’s distinction between determinism and fatalism

Midgeley argues (against the above argument) that free will and determinism are compatible. She distinguishes between determinism and fatalism.

Determinism is predicting events in advance given suitable evidence (i.e. what science does). Fatalism is the belief that human action is useless (whatever is chosen, the outcome is the same: human actions have no influence on future events). Her point is that if we think determinism is incompatible with free will, we are mistakenly treating Determinism as thought is is the same as Fatalism.

</br>

### Outline Midgeley’s argument that free will and determinism are compatible

The regularity of nature does not mean that we lost the ability to make free choices. Human free will is not the absence of causation or the impossibility of prediction. Rather, ‘free will’ is to rationally consider and address dilemmas. The physical processes of the brain do not ‘force’ our thoughts to occur as they do and so determine our choices. Thinking is not an illusion. Free will is shown in our reasoning, which is not at odds with the regularities discovered by science.

### Explain Plantinga’s distinction between a theodicy and a defence, and why a defence is sufficient to resolve the logical problem of evil

A theodicy is *the* explanation for why God allows evil, whereas a defence is a possible explanation for the compatibility of God and evil. Plantinga’s point is all that is a defence - a possible solution.

</br>

### Explain Plantinga’s free will defence

The world is more perfect/better with beings possessing free will, but beings possessing free will cannot be caused to do what is right. It is therefore possible that God can only eliminate the moral evil committed by free beings by eliminating the greater good of such beings. In short, according to Plantinga’s free will defence, the logical problem does not show that the existence of God and evil are logically inconsistent.

</br>

### Does Plantinga’s argument only apply to moral evil?

Plantinga claims that it is possible that natural evil is the result of moral evil by Satan. Alternatively, it might be argued that natural evil is necessary for the development of goodness/virtues (i.e. natural evil as a moral test).

</br>

### Outline and explain the evidential problem of evil

The amount, distribution, and kinds of evil are compelling evidence that God does not exist (i.e. ‘God exists’ and ‘evil exists’ are incompatible because of the extent of evil). N.B. This is an empirical argument.

</br>

### Explain Plantinga’s response to the evidential problem of evil

Since we only have experience of this world, we have no evidence against the claim that this is the ‘best of all possible worlds’. It is possible that the distribution/amount/kind of evil found in the world is the minimum required for virtues and free will to be meaningful. In short, there is no better balance of good and evil possible: this is the ‘best of all possible worlds’.

</br>

### How might Plantinga’s response be criticised?

Plantinga’s argument might be criticised for only addressing the *amount* of evil - it ignores kinds and distribution. If it did include - for example - the kind of suffering experienced by childhood cancer sufferers, then his argument might look less persuasive. 

Is free will such a good that it outweighs all the evil that exists? Is free will such a good that it should never be interfered with? We might argue that free will is compatible with ‘selective interference’ by God to prevent especially horrendous instances of evil.

Plantinga’s reply is that if God intervened to prevent evil, this is the same as causing us to do good, so eliminating free will.

### Explain Hick’s response to [the animals point]

Hick questions whether, strictly speaking, animals ‘suffer’ in a morally meaningful sense. Yes, they experience pain, but it suggests they do not ‘suffer’ in a sense comparable to humans. Hick warns against misrepresenting the experience of animals, who, he says, live in the present moment, and so don’t experience moral regret, they don’t fear future moral misfortune. So, why do pain-experiencing animals exist. Animals exist so that humans have ‘cognitive freedom’ to choose not to believe in God - thus, our choice to believe in God (and reduce the epistemic distance between Him and us) is a morally meaningful choice. The pain experienced by animals is a challenge to us and opportunity for us to develop spiritually/morally: do we choose to help the animal or not?

In summary, animal pain adds to the plausibility of a God-less world: not believing in God is intellectually plausible - maybe our suffering is as meaningless as animal suffering. This plausibility gives us cognitive freedom - without this freedom choosing not to believe in God would be irrational. It also means that choosing to believe in God is morally meaningful. The pain of animals is a necessary part of a world in which our souls can develop
