# What is Knowledge? (Revised from Prep)
</br>

## Questions 

</br>

#### 1) Explain the difficulty surrounding our common uses of the words 'know' and 'knowledge'. Use some of the 'experimenting with ideas' examples to illustrate your answer.

We often use the words 'know' and 'knowledge' to describe something that we have learnt , either from experience or from being told. But this definition is very loose, and does not give us a sufficient idea as to what knowledge actually is. One difficulty with this definition is that we find it very hard to define what 'knowledge' is, and there are multiple theories and principles that describe it and it's properties. For example, while one person might say that knowledge must be justified and truthful, another might think the opposite. Therefore our common definitions of knowledge cannot truly be a definition, as there is great debate over what knowledge actually is. Here's a real life example: 

My friend tells me that a person whom I have never met nor seen has brown hair. Assuming my friend is a trusted source, I believe that statement to be justified. By some definitions, this would now be knowledge. However, my friend is incorrect. The person's hair is in fact blonde. So, is the knowledge that I though I possessed now no longer knowledge? Some say no, some say yes. And from this, we can see that our common definitions of knowledge cannot function correctly, as the concept of knowledge is contested.

##### Revised
'To know': Subjective? Assumption? Feeling/recognition/understanding
Knowledge: Objective? Certainly? I know that $E=mc^2$ but I do not have knowledge of this - I am merely acquainted with it

</br>

#### 2) What is meant by the term 'ability knowledge'

Ability knowledge is something that we have learnt *how* to do, for example how to ride a bike, or how to do a cartwheel.

##### Revised
Ability knowledge is often subconscious but hard to articulate
'I know how to breathe' - 'How do you breathe?' - 'Ummm... breathe?'


</br>

#### 3) Explain the claim that:
</br>

##### a) it is possible to have ability knowledge without being able to articulate it

Whilst I know how to ride a bike, having been taught at an early age, and can demonstrate this to others, I cannot explain exactly how I ride the bike. The ability to balance for example cannot be explained to another person, but I still have the knowledge on how to do it.

##### b) some forms of ability knowledge depend on other forms of knowledge

Let's use the analogy of riding a bike again. To have developed and learnt this ability, I have had to learn exactly how. I have been given specific instructions on how to do this. Therefore, this ability knowledge relies on knowing other types of knowledge, such as how to change gears, or how to mount the bike.

###### Revised
Goes beyond instinct. Requires acquaintance knowledge.
</br>

#### 4) What is meant by 'Acquaintance knowledge'

'Acquaintance knowledge' describes knowledge that is gained through experience and becoming acquainted and used to something 

###### Revised
Can be developed e.g. 'I know Oakham', 'I know a certain person'

</br>

#### 5) What is:

</br>

##### a) a proposition?

A proposition is 'what is expressed by a declarative statement' (*Philosophy for AS and A Level*), e.g 1 + 1 = 2

###### Revised
What a statement asserts about the world

##### b) propositional knowledge

Propositional knowledge is knowledge that we know to be true or false, even without any prior experience to justify the knowledge. For example, mathematical knowledge is usually propositional.

</br>

#### 6) Explain the claim that acquaintance and ability knowledge do not involve propositions about the world

Acquaintance and ability knowledge must be built up and gained. Returning to the bike riding example, there is no 'true' or 'false' in the ability to ride a bike. Acquaintance knowledge cannot involved propositions, as it is knowledge that you, personally, have gained, despite it's degree of truthfulness.

###### Revised
A proposal of fact, 'of' and 'how', make no statement about the way the world is
</br>

#### 7) Explain the difference between belief, proposition, fact and truth

- Belief: an acceptance that something exists or is true, with or without justification (e.g belief in god, the supernatural, etc.)
- Proposition: Something that is either true or false, with justification explaining why it is so
- Fact: Something that has been proven to be true through empirical evidence and is indisputable
- Truth: Something that is correct in accordance to perception of reality

While propositions, beliefs, fact and truth are similar, they all have subtle differences that distinguish them as separate concepts. This can be the justification behind them, evidence or lack thereof, or indisputability. 

##### Revised
Belief: Thought about the world; we do not know for sure but we persistently agree on, a claim whether true or false
Proposition: A statement about how something in the world is; can be true or false 
Fact: Something that has been proven to be true through empirical evidence and is generally indisputable; Cannot be true or false
Truth: Alignment of facts and beliefs; correct in accordance to perception of reality
