# Ryle's Soft Behaviourism

</br>

Ryleâ€™s behaviourism is not based on an appeal to the verification principle or any other analysis of meaning. So he does not claim that mental state can be reduced to behavioural states without any loss of meaning.

Instead, he claims that many mental states are dispositions (how $x$ will, or is likely to, behave under certain circumstances) rather than occurrences.
