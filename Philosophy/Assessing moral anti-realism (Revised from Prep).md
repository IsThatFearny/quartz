# Assessing moral anti-realism (Revised from Prep)

</br>

### Explain two objections to emotivism

1) We can object that being emotive and influencing attitudes is something that non-moral language is capable of, e.g. advertising. We must therefore say more to distinguish these
2) Moral language isn’t necessarily emotive. The words ‘good’, ‘right’ and ‘bad’ may arouse emotions in others or express our own, but this depends on context. We do not always think that it is good to arouse emotions in others on moral issues. Sometimes, moral discussion should be dispassionate

#### Revised

1) Moral language is not always used in an emotive way: moral language is not always directed towards influencing the moral attitudes of others, e.g. in cases where one knows that one’s interlocutor has the same moral attitude, one’s use of moral language is simply to complain or ‘vent’.
2) Moral language is sometimes used in a dispassionate manner (i.e. non-emotively), e.g. when one is seeking to be sensitive about an especially controversial issue such as abortion.
3) Seeking to influence attitudes is no exclusive specifically to moral language: advertising for example, seeks to use language in this way but is not always - or often - moral.

</br>

### Are these objections effective?

No: these objections only serve to show that moral language isn’t always emotive, not that it isn’t ‘essentially’ emotive.

#### Revised

We might argue that these criticisms are not decisive: emotivism only claims that moral language is generally used in an emotive way, not that it is *always* used emotively, nor that it is the only type of language used emotively.

Many types of language can be used in non-standard ways in different situations - e.g. the use of factual statements - ‘$x$ has a big nose’ - as an insult: just because the statement is being used as an insult in this case does not make the meaning of the statement emotive - it remains a descriptive fact.

</br>

### Explain the objection that moral language is not only prescriptive

Moral language has many functions, aside from prescription. For example, someone may ask what to do. There are lots of other situations in which we can use moral language - we may implore, confess, complain, etc.

#### Revised

Prescriptivism argues that the sole function of moral language is to prescribe for action. However, we might argue that moral language might also be used to describe and/or complain, exhort…

Hare’s reply is that, much like the emotivist, he can make the point that indeed moral language may perform other functions, but this does not undermine its primary role of prescribing for action. The key point, Hare says, is that in holding a view such as ‘killing is wrong’ I am thereby committed to acting on it.

Hare’s point is well-made (moral language is not exclusively used to prescribe; nonetheless prescription for action is integral to moral language). However, Hare’s point doesn’t necessarily support the prescriptivist argument - whilst he succeeds in connecting ethical language to action, Hare hasn’t shown that ethical language must be prescriptive (ethical language also expresses desires and attitudes, e.g. I might ‘like apples’ but never eat them).

</br>

### Explain the objective that non-cognitivist theories cannot explain the multiple uses of moral language

Non-cognitivist theories have to argue that one use of moral language is essential in order to overcome counter-examples. Objections rest on the claim that that moral language has multiple uses. It can be used in many ways, and express different psychological states.

#### Revised

Non-cognitivist theories cannot explain the multiple roles of language. The criticism claims that moral language is used in various ways and expresses multiple psychological states. This is a general problem for non-cognitivist theories, which have to argue that the use of moral language (‘it’s emotive’ or ‘it’s prescriptive’) is essential/privileged in order to answer the problem of counter-examples.

Cognitivist theories avoid this problem because they view moral language as statements of fact - for example, the statement ‘killing is wrong’ can function as a way of influencing, complaining, expressing, etc. but these do not give us the meaning of the statement, which is only possible in terms of whether the statement is true or false.

</br>

### Explain the objection that emotivism cannot explain moral reasoning. Is the argument effective?

Emotivism claims that moral judgements and arguments are about influencing people’s attitudes, and this claim means that a good moral argument will be one that is effective. This is the only criterion. If an argument makes someone change their mind, then it is a good argument. But surely this is highly unsatisfactory? The argument is effective, because it overcomes Ayer’s objection (that moral arguments are not arguments over moral judgements, but over facts) by arguing that it is perhaps incorrect to state that there can be disagreement over a moral judgement when it has no truth value, and by claiming that if emotivism is correct, it would seem that thinking about a question is irrational, because according to emotivism you should be able to answer said question by noting your current attitude towards it.

#### Revised

The criticism focuses on a potential limitation of emotivism (maybe Prescriptivism escapes it?). The criticism claims that, in reducing moral language to the expression of emotional states (approval/disapproval : “abortion is wrong” = “I don’t approve of abortion”) if implies that moral language is not a rational matter at all, merely a form of (emotional) manipulation. In short, emotivism reduces moral discourse to a form of propaganda/psychological bullying and nothing more.

Stated otherwise, the goal of moral language is not the discovery of moral truth, merely a good moral argument is one that is effective in manipulating others to agree.

Can emotivism respond? Ayer argues that moral arguments are not about moral judgements but instead about facts - in, for example, an argument about vegetarianism, a vegetarian might remark to the carnivore that animal farming leads to animal suffering - as such, the vegetarian is not seeking to change the carnivore’s emotional disposition, because the argument presupposes both care about animal suffering. The argument concerns the facts of such suffering. Ayer’s point is that if we agree on the facts of the matter, but moral disagreement remains then there is nothing left to discuss - no further debate can take place.

However, according to Ayer himself, moral judgements have no truth value, and therefore there can be no moral disagreement in the first place, regardless of the facts of the matter. 

Further, emotivism fails to give an adequate account of deliberation: specifically, it isn’t easy to see why, for the emotivist, moral deliberation has much purpose - for cognitivism, by contrast, moral deliberation involves reflecting on whether I ought to hold my existing/inherited moral opinions. But on the emotivist account it is not obvious why I would bother with this problem at all.

</br>

### How does the prescriptivist account of moral reasoning differ from the emotive account?

Prescriptivism claims that:

1) We can ask about someone’s reasons for prescribing their actions
2) Morality involves consistency - moral judgements must be universalised between things such as the suffering of people and animals.
3) We can infer prescriptions from other prescriptions, e.g. the claim that ‘abortion is wrong’ can be inferred from the statement that ‘taking an innocent human life is wrong’. Thus, our prescriptions are logically linked to each other.

#### Revised

N.B. Prescriptivism views itself as a non-cognitivist response to the preceding problems faced by emotivism

Thus, Prescriptivism argues that it *can* account for moral reasoning on three counts: 

1) We can ask about someone’s reasons for prescribing what they do (the attitude-action link)
2) Morality involves consistency - moral judgements must be universalised not only in terms of the attitude - action relation but also between attitudes held concurrently. Moral disagreements can be about the consistency in applying certain standards - which reasoning can help resolve.
3) We can infer prescriptions from other prescriptions (and so debate whether a given influence is sound or not), e.g. ‘taking innocent human life is wrong’, therefore ‘abortion is wrong’. We might argue about this attitude: specifically whether it is a sound attitude. 
### Can prescriptivism explain moral reasoning?

It can be objected that the only kind of rationality that prescriptivism can recognise in moral argument is consistency. Hare’s theory (in terms of universalisability) bares a relation to Kantian Deontology. However, Hare rejects Kant’s argument that the standards for the good will are set by reason. This means, as long as I am prepared to universalise a claim, there is no objective ground on which to disagree. Thus, prescriptivism cannot explain moral reasoning. 

#### Revised

It can be objected that the only rationality (and thus basis for moral discourse) that Prescriptivism can recognise is consistency (coherence). In claiming that moral judgements need to be universalisable, Hare draws on Kant’s first formulation of the categorical imperative. And yet, Kant’s theory argues that the test of universalisability is dictated by reason and, as such, objective. But as an antirealist and non-cognitivist, Hare rejects this: neither empirical facts nor reason entails that we must adopt one set of standards over another.

Hare’s response to this criticism is to argue to prescribe for actions that would frustrate one’s own interests is irrational. Thus, his moral system gives us a version of the ‘golden rule’ - (i.e. ‘do unto others…’). To prescribe otherwise would be inconsistent.

There is another version of the same line of criticism: the prescriptivist says “don’t steal because doing so will make your life difficult (i.e. not so good)”. That is the prescriptivist’s reasoning for not stealing, which makes a tacit/implied appeal to a moral standard. But Hare says there are no such objective standards to appeal to. If someone has an alternative conception of the good, and are consistent with it (that stealing will improve life) then there is basis for objecting to it.
</br>
### Does moral anti-realism lead to moral nihilism?

Moral anti-realism claims that there are no mind-independent moral properties, no objective moral truths, and non-cognitivist forms claim that morality is an expression of emotions/attitudes. Thus, because we invent moral values, we have no obligation to be moral and no obligations to have certain emotions. So why accept morality at all?

Moral anti-realists argue that this is an unfair simplification or a misunderstanding. Error theory allows for subjective moral values, and all three anti-realist theories argue that living without moral values is itself an expression of feeling. This, therefore, does not mean that we should stop having moral feelings.

The critic responds that this is unjustifiable. We cannot justify interfering with the behaviour of others. This seems very petty. Whilst the anti-realist may argue that our interference is not due to mere disagreement, but dues to the other person being racist, cowardly, cruel, etc, the previous example of how we cannot disagree with questionable views due to there being no objective grounds on which to do so can be used against this. Thus, we can conclude that moral anti-realism does indeed lead to moral nihilism.

#### Revised

Moral Nihilism is the position that morality does exist since there are no objective moral values/standards (it is usually an accusation rather than a position adopted, as in this case). The accusation here is that Prescriptivism collapses into moral nihilism in spite of its efforts to resist the change.

Moral anti-realism maintains that there are no mind-independent (and thus ‘objective’) moral properties. Therefore we might object that if moral values are thus our own invention then there is no moral obligation to be moral, because we are not bound by moral emotions and dispositions of others. In short, if moral values are not objective, then they are not binding.

The anti-realist response is that this accusation, at best, is based on a misunderstanding and at worst a wilful misrepresentation of anti-realism. Anti-realism does not entail the rejection of all moral value. Thus, error, theory allows that we have subjective moral values, and all three theories (emotivism, prescriptivism, and error theory) argue that the attempt to live without moral values is itself to make a moral choice/express moral feelings that other people may have moral objections to. In short, the idea that moral values reflect objective moral feelings does not entail that we should have such feelings.

The critic’s further response is to argue that this reply is inadequate as a grounds for expecting others to accept one’s prescriptions for action. This is because any objective basis for imposing one’s own subjective moral values on others is completely lacking.

### How does moral anti-realism account for moral progress?

If there is no moral reality, then our moral views cannot become better or worse - they cannot make progress. The anti-realist response to this is that people’s moral views can progress if they become more rational, e.g. discovering previously unknown facts, becoming more consistent in their principles, or becoming more coherent in moral judgements.

The anti-realist can also respond that we can make moral progress because we can disapprove of past moral codes and approve of our own. Society has moved on from ‘bad’ moral principles.

#### Revised

Moral realism can give an account of moral progress - at T1 (1828) we had a mistaken understanding of the moral facts of slavery, whilst at T2 (1840) we had a better grasp of the facts. We had made moral progress. This way of measuring moral progress is not available to anti-realism because there are no moral facts of any matter, not least slavery. Does the anti-realist have an alternative account of moral progress? They argue that they do:

1) They content that there can be improvements in people’s moral views if they become more rational, such as: a) people can become more aware of facts such as - in the slavery example - how the trade was conducted, the extent of human suffering, etc. (Ayer would make this point).

## Metaethics and applied ethics
</br>

### Explain why moral realist theories make little difference to answers in applied ethics

Moral realism means that whether stealing is wrong is dependent upon whether stealing has the property of being wrong. This applies to other ethical issues as well. However, Moral Realism cannot tell us what property wrongness is. Thus, it makes very little difference to applied ethics. It simply supports the thought that what we are doing when we practise applied ethics is trying to discover the truth in answer to the question.

</br>

### How does non-cognitivism respond to questions in applied ethics?

Non-cognitivism responds to ethical questions by claiming that expressions of emotion are satisfactory answers to questions of applied ethics. Even if our views are not true or false, we can still promote expressions of how we want people to behave.
