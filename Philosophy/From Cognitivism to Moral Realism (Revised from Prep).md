# From Cognitivism to Moral Realism (Revised from Prep)

</br>

### Outline three arguments for moral realism


1) We can make mistakes about morality. Children often do, and they have to be taught what is right and wrong
2) Morality feels like an ‘external’ demand. We feel answerable to a standard of behaviour which is independent of what we want or feel.
3) Many people believe in moral progress. But how is moral progress possible, unless some views about morality are better than others? And how can this be possible unless there are facts about morality?

#### Revised

1) We can make mistakes about morality. If there were no moral facts - e.g. ‘human slavery is wrong’ - then moral mistakes would not be possible.
2) Morality feels like a demand from ‘outside’ us - objective - morality imposes itself on us rather than being determined by, our own feelings/desires.
3) Moral progress (replacing false beliefs with true beliefs) only makes sense from a cognitivist/moral realist perspective

### What is moral realism?

[[Philosophy/Glossary#Moral realism|Moral realism]] claims that good and bad are properties of situations and people, and right and wrong are properties of actions. These properties are genuine parts of the world. Whether moral judgements are true or false depends on the way that the word is and on what properties an action, person or situation actually has.

#### Revised

Moral Realism argues that there are moral truths - what sort of truths are they? Moral Realists argue that good and bad are properties of situations and individuals, and right and wrong are properties of actions. Whether moral judgements are good/bad, right/wrong depends on the way the world is - i.e. on what properties an act, individual or situation possesses ‘out there’ in the real world

A key question addressed by Moral Realism - what is the relationship between moral properties and natural properties? Moral naturalists claim that moral properties are natural properties. By contrast, moral non-naturalists hold that moral properties are a distinct non-natural type of property. 

### What is moral naturalism, with reference to the nature of non-reductive moral naturalism?

[[Philosophy/Glossary#Moral naturalism|Moral naturalism]] is the claim that moral properties are natural properties. There are two types of this: reductive and non-reductive. G.E. Moore gives the definition of natural properties as ‘properties that we can identify through sense experience and science’. This is the reductive form of moral naturalism, in which we ‘reduce’ moral properties to other forms, such as psychological properties (e.g. happiness). Non-reductive moral naturalism argues that morality is an expression of the natural capacities of human beings, the capacities we have as a species of animal, which are a part of our nature. This rejects ‘supernatural’ forms of morality (such as morality being determined by god).

#### Revised

Moral naturalism argues that moral properties are natural properties. The distinction between reductive and non-reductive types of moral naturalism hinges on different claims about what counts as ‘natural’. G.E. Moore’s account of natural properties is those that we can identify through sense-experiences and scientific testing. Thus understood, Moral Naturalism is a type of reductionism - i.e. the claim that the things in one domain (the moral properties of goodness and rightness) are identical with the properties of things in a separate domain: science. Most plausibly, natural properties that might be identical with moral properties are specific psychological properties such as happiness. The ‘reduction’ here is the point that there is nothing more to moral properties than being a certain type of psychological property (they are equivalent/identical).

Non-reductive moral naturalism, by contrast, argues that morality is an expression of the natural capacities of human beings as rational creatures. This form of moral naturalism rejects explanations that explain morality in supernatural terms (i.e. in relation to God) or that when making moral judgements we use a ‘non-natural’ faculty of reason (as Kant believed). Non-reductive moral naturalism argues that moral properties are natural but cannot be reduced to (i.e. are not identical to) any other kind of property (most obviously scientific properties). 

### Explain Utilitarianism as a form of reductive moral naturalism

The utilitarian claim that ‘the only good is happiness’ can be interpreted as a reductive claim. Happiness and goodness can therefore be equated. Happiness is a natural property, and therefore so is goodness. As happiness is a natural property, the maximisation of happiness is also a natural property. According to Utilitarianism, ‘rightness’ is also a natural property, and thus Utilitarianism can be interpreted as a form of reductive moral naturalism.

#### Revised

Bentham argues that we are only ever motivated by the pursuit of pleasure (and the avoidance of pain). From this natural fact Utilitarianism proceeds. Mill might be said to follow this lead:  to say that $x$ is good and to say that $x$ produces happiness (understood as pleasure) is to say the same thing. In other words, the good is ‘reduced’ to happiness (pleasure).

### Explain the difference between reductive moral naturalism and non-reductive Aristotelian naturalism

Aristotelian virtue ethics is a form of non-reductive moral naturalism, because morality is based on natural facts about human nature. We can identify flourishing in any species by using biology, ethology and psychology, and so these can help us identify what eudaimonia involves for us. Further to this, it is a natural fact that human beings are rational animals. However, virtue ethics cannot be *reduced* to claims about natural facts, as the rationality involved in practical wisdom is not just a matter of knowing and applying facts that we can discover through sense-experience and science.

#### Revised

We might interpret the function argument as reductive: the facts about human nature (especially our ability to reason) as the basis for moral truths. In short, just as there are facts about our natural function, so there are facts about how to fulfil that function.

However, many modern virtue ethicists - such as Annas - seek to reinterpret Aristotle as a non-reductive moral naturalist: Morality is based on natural facts about human nature (e.g. rationality is a natural fact about human nature), but Virtue Ethics can’t be reduced to claims about natural facts. Specifically, the rationality involved in practical wisdom is not merely a matter of knowing and applying natural facts acquired through observation and testing (as it is with other natural facts). Rather, it is about formulating, trying out, and evaluating ways of living - looking at the reasons (aims) for living in this way or that way. 

In short, the latter process is not reducible to the rational pursuit of natural facts.

### What is moral non-naturalism?

[[Philosophy/Glossary#Moral non-naturalism|Moral non-naturalism]] is the claim that moral properties are not natural properties (this is in the sense that a natural property is ‘a property that we can discover through sense experience and the sciences’).

#### Revised

Moral properties are not natural properties. In Moore’s specific case, the focus for his disagreement is with reductive moral naturalism.

### What is the ‘naturalistic fallacy’ (with reference to the correlation/identity distinction)?

The naturalistic fallacy is any attempt to identify goodness with a natural property. Moral properties may be *correlated* with natural properties, but it is essential to note that correlation is not identity. So, even if goodness is correlated with happiness or pleasure, this does not mean that they are the same property. Because goodness is not a natural property, and can’t therefore be analysed in terms of any other property, it would be a mistake to think that the property of goodness is identical with any natural property.

#### Revised

Moore argues that there is no identity between moral and natural properties (hence the rejection of moral naturalism) but there may be a correlation between natural and moral properties. 

What sort of correlation? The size and the shape of an object are distinct properties of the object but they are correlated - i.e. no object has a size without also having a shape. Similarly, according to Moore, ‘goodness’ and ‘happiness’ (or ‘pleasure’) may be correlated, but they remain distinctive properties. Moore labelled the attempt to identify natural properties with moral properties as the ‘naturalistic fallacy’ - i.e. the error of moral naturalism. 

Moore’s insistence of the naturalistic fallacy concentrates on the notion of goodness. Moore insists that goodness is a simply and unanalysable property - i.e. it cannot be defined in terms of anything else. This is not to claim that we cannot analyse how the word ‘goodness’ is used. It makes sense to claim that ‘pleasure is good’, for example. But there are two things here - ‘pleasure’ and ‘goodness’: there is ‘pleasure’, and it has the additional property of goodness. So, we can meaningfully say that ‘pleasure is a good’ if we distinguish between pleasure and goodness. But we can’t give a definition that defines ‘goodness’ in terms of its parts (parts such as ‘pleasure’) that together make up goodness.

Colour is another simple concept - we can describe objects *as* yellow (e.g.lemons, the sun), but these things don’t define yellowness, which is a simple property that cannot be explained to someone who doesn’t know it (hasn’t experienced it). Unlike colours, ‘goodness’ is not a natural property, Moore clarifies! Crucially, ‘goodness’ cannot be investigated by empirical means. It is real, Moore argues, but not part of the natural world. Thus, because goodness can’t be analysed in terms of any other property, it is a mistake to think that ‘goodness’ is identical with any natural property.

### Explain Moore’s ‘open question’ argument

Moore uses this argument to support his view that a definition of goodness is impossible. An open question is a question to which the answer is variable, e.g. yes or no. If goodness is pleasure, then it wouldn’t make sense to ask ‘is pleasure good?’ - this would be equivalent to asking ‘is pleasure pleasure?’. The answer has to be yes, and cannot logically be no, and so the question is a closed question. However, Moore says that the question ‘is pleasure good?’ is not a closed question, because it is possible for the answer to be either yes or no. Goodness, therefore, cannot be pleasure, nor any other property, as asking whether $x$ is good is always an open question.

#### Revised

What is an ‘open question’? One the answer to which could be ‘yes’ or ‘no’ without self-evident contradiction. If goodness just ‘is pleasure’ then it wouldn’t make sense to ask ‘is pleasure good?’. But it *does* make sense to ask - it is an ‘open question.

To explain: we can say that asking ‘it is pleasurable, but is it pleasurable?’ is a closed question, rather like ‘he is a bachelor, but is he unmarried?’. In the case of goodness, if goodness is the same thing as pleasure, then ‘it is pleasurable, but is it good?’ is obviously a closed question. But Moore’s point is that this isn’t a closed question - the answer can be ‘yes’ or ‘no’ (without obvious self-contradiction). Likewise, ‘is pleasure good?’ - thus, goodness cannot be pleasure or any other property: non least is it a mistake to think that goodness is identical with any natural property. 

### Is the naturalistic fallacy a genuine fallacy?

If we were to portray the argument differently, as below, then it becomes clear that Moore’s open question argument doesn’t work.

```ad-note
title: The failing of the naturalistic fallacy

The property of 'being water' cannot be any other property in the world, such as the property of being H<sub>2</sub>0. If it was, then the question 'Is water H<sub>2</sub>0?' would not make sense - alike to asking 'is H<sub>2</sub>0 H<sub>2</sub>0?'. Thus, water is a simple, unanalysable property. This cannot be right, as water *just is* H<sub>2</sub>0.
```

This argument confuses concepts and properties. The two different concepts - ‘water’ and ‘H<sub>2</sub>0’ - can pick out the same property in the world. People knew about water long before the discovery of hydrogen and oxygen. They had this concept, but not the concept of H<sub>2</sub>0. However, the two concepts relate to the same thing in the world, and therefore water is identical to H<sub>2</sub>0. 

In a similar way, the concept of ‘goodness’ is a different concept from ‘happiness’, but the two concepts may refer to the same property in the world, and so goodness is happiness. Moore’s open question argument fails to show that these are different properties.

#### Revised

It might be argued that Moore confuses concepts and properties. Two different concepts can relate to the same property in the world - e.g. ‘water’ and ‘H<sub>2</sub>0’. Likewise, the concept ‘goodness’ is a different concept from ‘happiness’. We can accept that Moore has established this, yet might it remain the case that the two concepts relate to some property in the world, and so goodness is happiness. Crucially, Moore does not show that they are different properties.

### What is [[Philosophy/Glossary#intuitionism|intuitionism]]?

All that Moore thinks we can do is to prove a claim is to consider the truth of the claim - such as ‘pleasure is good’ - itself. Moore calls these claims ‘intuitions’. These are incapable of proof, he says. They therefore must be some variety of synthetic a priori knowledge. Intuitions are self-evident proposals. Intuitionism, in essence, is simply a form of ethical non-naturalism that claims that some our our moral judgements are synthetic yet self-evident.

#### Revised

So, Moore rejects moral naturalism (at least, reductive moral naturalism), without altogether rejecting cognitivism and the claim that moral properties are real. The result is Moore’s intuitionism.

How do we discover moral properties that aren’t natural but are real? Mills says that we cannot prove what is good deductively, though we can establish what is good by induction. Moore insists that we cannot prove it by deduction *or* induction. What’s left? All we can do is to consider whether it is intuitively true.

What is an intuition?:

```ad-quote
title: Moore:
color: 150, 75, 200

“When I call such propositions [i.e. moral intuitions] intuitions, I mean merely to assert that they are incapable of proof; I imply nothing whatever as to the manner or origin of our cognition of them”
```

This is a very minimal definition! But he has already said more than this - intuitions are not analytic truths. He already said they are not discovered through induction, so they must be some sort of synthetic a priori knowledge (i.e. knowledge about the way the world is without experiencing the world). As such, intuitions are self-evident propositions.

What do we mean by ‘self-evident’? *Not* ‘obvious’! Our ability to reach self-evident truths needs to be carefully developed. Hence, moral intuitions are more like necessary truths (as in maths) or claims about what is logically possible.
