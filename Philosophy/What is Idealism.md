# What is Idealism?

</br>

Direct Realism: The claim that we perceive the external world directly; the external world is mind-independent (this is important for realism)

Indirect Realism: The claim that immediate objects are mind-dependent sense-data, which represent mind-independent physical objects and their properties.

Idealism is the claim that the immediate content of our perception is mind-dependent ideas of physical objects an their properties. 

Berkeley presents this argument in 'Three dialogues between Hylas and Philonous'. He begins with an attack on Locke's primary and secondary quality distinction. This states that secondary qualities are subjective to perceptual variation. The Indirect Realist, therefore, concludes that they are mind-dependent. Similarly, primary qualities are subject to perceptual variation, e.g. size is relative to the relative size and position of the perceiver. We should therefore also conclude that primary qualities are mind-dependent. So, the logic of indirect realism shows that primary and secondary qualities are both mind-dependent.

Berkely also presents three arguments against the existence of mind-independent physical objects. The first is that of a material substratum. In *Three Dialogues*, Hylas argues that we require the idea of a 'material substratum' - substance that possesses primary and secondary qualities, and joins together to make one thing. Hylas says that this can exist unperceived. Berkely responds that all you can say about an object are it's primary or secondary qualities. In the absence of these (as a material substratum is never perceived, in Berkely's opinion), we cannot describe or imagine an object, as our perception of an object it simply the sum of its properties. The second argument is on our perception of physical objects. Berkely notes that neither our senses nor reason support the claim that we perceive physical objects. Having previously asserted that all that we perceive are primary and secondary qualities, Berkely concludes that our experience cannot verify the hypothesis of a mind-independent external world. In addition to this, the hypothesis of physical substance is not only unverifiable, but is not suggested by our experience. if we pay close attention to experience, we come to understand that all we can say there is is what we can experience. Further to this, Berkely says that we can only experience ideas, and therefore experience supports idealism over realism. Berkely's third argument is that from scepticism. If we suppose that the objects of our perception can and do exist independently of perception, this leads to scepticism. We cannot know that our perception is representative of the theoretical external world, nor can we connect our experiences to something beyond them (which is impossible to describe or understand, in accordance with the previous argument).
