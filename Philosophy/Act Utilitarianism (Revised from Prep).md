# Act Utilitarianism (Revised from Prep)

</br>

## a) Problems with calculation
</br>

### Explain the criticism that, far from being clear and straightforward, act utilitarianism is too difficult and time consuming

Mill notes that it may not be possible to calculate the utility of an action, or may be far too difficult and time-consuming. Take Bentham's Felicific Calculus for example. Whilst on paper, it may seem easy to understand, in practise it is massively overcomplicated and takes a lot of time to use. In addition, it will likely be impossible to calculate all the relevant information (due to subjectivity, etc.) 

##### Revised
Contrary to the claim that Act Utilitarianism is simple to understand (i.e. the greatest happiness principle) and easy to apply, once it is taken seriously the opposite emerges as the truth: Bentham's seven criteria are not easy to grasp let alone apply to situations, especially in combination. There is also the issue of how we are supposed to predict consequences, given the huge number of variables involved (i.e. the problem of predicting the future). And the further issue is the time required to make act utilitarianism calculations, even supposing we understand the criteria and the future can be predicted (here, Preference Utilitarianism would seem to have an advantage - if the criteria is the satisfaction of preferences, these would seem to be easier to understand and to assess) 

</br>

### How might it be argued that the criticism misrepresents the utilitarian argument?

This criticism is a misinterpretation of the argument. Bentham does not say that an action is right if it actually maximises happiness. Instead, he says that an action can be considered to be 'right' if we can reasonably expect it to maximise happiness. In addition, Bentham states that the felicific calculus need not be adhered to completely, but 'kept in view' and used as a guideline

##### Revised

Bentham is aware that the purist application of the happiness principle (that each action must maximise happiness) is impractical: He explicitly states that 'an action is right according to the tendency that it appears to maximise happiness' - this 'lowers the bar', so to speak - it eases the burden of calculation

</br>

### Explain Mill's response to this criticism, with reference to 'secondary principles'

Mill responds to this by claiming that we don't actually need to try to work out the consequences of an action, as over time, we have already prescribed moral correctness to actions which tend to produce happiness. These are our inherited moral rules, or as Mill calls them, 'secondary principles'. He says that only in cases of moral conflict should there be exceptions to these rules, and that is therefore the only scenario in which we need to calculate to consequences of an action.

##### Revised
Mill says that Act Utilitarianism remains too demanding. His response is that we ease the burden of calculation by employing what he terms 'secondary principles' (N.B. the utility principle remains the 'primary' principle). Secondary principles such as 'do not lie', 'do not steal, 'do not kill', 'keep promises', etc. arise because i past experience they have, on the whole, proved to maximise the general happiness. Thus, calculation involves not the application of Bentham's felicific calculus, but consideration of which secondary principle is applicable to the situation in view of the need to maximise happiness (primary principle). It is only when there is a conflict between secondary principles that we need fall back on something like the felicific calculus.

</br>

### Explain Bentham and Singer's argument that Utilitarianism requires us to take account of the happiness of non-human animals

Bentham argues that, if a being can suffer (or feel pleasure) then it should factored into Utilitarianism. Happiness remains good no matter which creature experiences it. Singer develops this argument, and says that, alike to sexism and racism, placing one species above another is 'speciesism'. Singer states that as long as a creature is sentient and can experience pleasure and suffering, then it should be involved in Utilitarian thinking. Animals, Singer says, should be treated completely equally to humans in this regard.

##### Revised
One aspect of the burden of calculation is whose happiness is supposed to be considered - only those who happen to be alive, but also future generations? If so, how many? Bentham (and Singer) potentially add to the problem by suggesting that not only humans be considered but any species that experiences. Singer argues that prioritising the pain/pleasure/preferences of humans over other animals is 'speciesism' (equivalent to racism, sexism, etc.)

We might argue that Singer offers a false equivalence: humans are categorically different to animals, so prioritising human pleasure/preferences over those of animals is not comparable to discrimination. However, Singer says that humans and animals are equivalent in the ways that matter, namely with regard to the capacity to feel pleasure/pain. Who experiences the pain is irrelevant.

</br>

### What are the implications of having to include animals in Utilitarian calculations?

This argument raises various issues with Utilitarianism. How, for example, are we able to solve such issues as whether we should eat meat, or destroy habitats to make new farms, when the happiness of animals must be factored in. It is near impossible to equate the happiness of a human and a pig, cow, or bird, as there are major differences between them.

##### Revised

If Singer's argument stands, then the problem of calculation is significantly exacerbated - we now have to take account of the pleasure/preferences of all humans but also animals capable of experiencing pain.

In response to Mill, who might seek to solve this problem in terms of secondary principles - here, specifically, the principle not to be cruel to animals and the principle that humans have moral priority over animals - because those principles do not take equal account of the happiness of animals.

Singer argues in reply to this that a new customary morality (i.e. set of secondary principles) is required - one that takes account of non-human suffering.

</br>

## b) Fairness, individual liberty and right
</br>

### Explain the objection - with specific reference to Mill - that Utilitarianism leads to the 'tyranny of the majority'

Mill feared the consequences, in a democracy, of the impact of decision made in the name of the greatest happiness of the greatest number on the interests of the minorities. - e.g. removing the rights of the 20% if it would maximise the happiness of the 80%.

This can happen in two ways: by legislative means - when the majority wish to pursue a certain policy maximising their happiness of the minority, and by social opinion - the majority creating social norms, the 'right way of thinking', that intimidates and oppresses minority views and their expression.

</br>

### Explain the objection that Utilitarianism doesn't recognise individual rights

Bentham famously described the concept of 'rights' as "nonsense on stilts" - i.e. complete nonsense. The only moral concern is the maximisation of happiness, and to uphold so-called 'rights' in spite of this concern is to undermine the good, he  argued. So, if the utility principle is the only moral concern, rights that must be upheld/protected regardless of the consequences become redundant. In short, Utilitarianism has no time for individual rights - and a good job too, Bentham argued

</br>

### Explain Mill's concept of justice - with reference to 'imperfect duties' - and how Mill seeks to resolve the conflict between Utilitarianism and rights

According to Mill, 'justice' involves actions that relate to individual rights. these duties are what he terms 'perfect', we must always perform them, e.g. keeping promises, truth-telling, equal treatment, etc.

By contrast, 'imperfect' duties leave us room for choosing how to fulfil the duty. In addition, such duties are not owed to everyone, unlike perfect duties, which are. 

The rationale for individual rights is the general happiness. We protect our primary interest with rights, and these become the subject of justice - why? Because rights and justice contribute most to happiness in the long term. Mill: "Justice... grounded in utility [is the] chief part of all morality"

</br>

### Outline the objection that Act Utilitarianism cannot defend individual rights in cases of conflict with the general happiness, with reference to ways in which Mill might respond to this criticism and whether such a response is successful

Can Act Utilitarianism defend individual rights in cases of conflict with the general happiness?  Mill's argument is that we possess rights to the extent that possessing them contributes to the general happiness in the long term. We might argue that this fails to offer a defence of individual rights in particular cases, e.g. killing one person to provide organs for five individuals in dire need of said organs would - in the name of the general happiness - appear to be a case in which we are justified in denying the donor the right not to lose their organs.

The point is that numerous 'particular' cases of this sort might be presented. How might Mill reply?

Mill says that this misunderstands Utilitarianism - it fails to understand Utilitarianism "in the largest sense", namely that rights protect our permanent interests. Accordingly, we should establish a system of rights that brings the most happiness and then defend it regardless of particular cases.

But this seems to give up on Act Utilitarianism altogether - we no longer calculate the consequences of actions in the name of the general happiness but instead creating a set of rights (rules) and enforce them regardless of the impact on the general happiness. In short, the right action is the one that protects our right rather than the one that promotes the general happiness

</br>

### Why might the requirement to consider the happiness of each person equally (i.e. impartiality) create a problem for Utilitarianism?

It is a 'strength' of Utilitarianism that all are treated impartially - everyone's happiness is equally important - we must be impartial about whose happiness we promote.

But (argues virtue ethics), this impartiality misunderstands the moral significance of partiality - e.g. in friendship, the moral bonds that we feel towards certain individuals rather than others. In insisting on impartiality, Utilitarianism loses sight of the importance of the individual and their particular relations
</br>

### How does Mill seek to respond to this problem and how successful is he in doing so?

Mill's response? We serve the greatest happiness by showing partiality - we have limited opportunities to benefit people in general and en masse, therefore in the vast bulk of our actions, only considering the interests of a limited number of people - family, friends, peers, etc. - is entirely reasonable, moreover what is practically feasible. And indeed, if everyone acted likewise then the general happiness would be served.
</br>

## Moral Integrity and the individual's intentions
</br>

### Explain the objection to act Utilitarianism from integrity, with reference to Bernard Williams' example of George

The criticism is that Utilitarianism requires us to set aside our moral values in order to maximise happiness. Thus, George (in B. Williams' example) is required by Act Utilitarianism to take the chemical warfare job, a) because it means he can help his family and b) he prevents someone more enthusiastic from causing more suffering. But, in so doing George is having to compromise his moral integrity - specifically, his opposition to chemical weapons

</br>

### With reference to Mill, explain how an act utilitarian can recognise the importance of intentions

Mill's response? Mill focuses on the importance of of secondary principles and intentions. 
</br>

### 13.
Mill argues that AU can recognise the importance of intentions (and thereby reply to the ‘moral integrity’ criticism – see q. 12). He concedes that U considers people’s intentions as irrelevant to whether an action is morally right (only consequences matter). But that does not mean that intentions have nothing to do with morality whatsoever: the utilitarian can argue that an intention that tends to produce morally bad outcomes (e.g. the intention to cause harm) is itself a bad intention, whereas intentions aimed at producing happiness are good intentions. Nonetheless, the utilitarian says, it remains important to distinguish whether an action was good/bad from whether the intention behind the action was good/bad. The utilitarian might also argue that good intentions are morally significant in that they are one of the ‘ingredients’ of happiness – having good intentions is itself a source of pleasure.
</br>

### 14. 

Is Mill’s response to the moral integrity criticism sound? The objection was that someone’s intentions make a moral difference to the action they undertake (e.g. the friend who lies to you accidentally v the friend who lies purposely). Mill continues to deny that intentions are irrelevant when judging actions – only consequences matter. Mill insists that intentions are only relevant when judging whether someone id a good person or not. As we shall see, virtue ethics will argue that Mill has got it wrong – whether someone is a good person is not an afterthought – it is absolutely central to morality.
