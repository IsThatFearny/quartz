Issues for Act Utilitarianism - Intentions ^x4XxcqNO

It can be argued that Act Utilitarianism ignores the value of our intentions, i.e. 'it is the thought that counts'.
Whether someone intends to harm us or not makes a big difference in how we respond to their action. But how can
this be if all that matters are consequences, not intentions?

Mill argues that the irrelevancy of intentions does not mean that intentions have nothing to do with morality, as
they are relevant when considering whether someone is a morally good person. the Utilitarian might also argue that
an intention that tends to produce morally wrong actions is bad, and vice versa.

It can be argued that good intentions can contribute to the greatest happiness in another way - having good
intentions is one of the 'ingredients' of happiness. Because people desire to do good because it is good, it is part
of their happiness that they have this motive. Doing good is pleasant to them. Thus, good intentions are a part
of people's happiness. ^TccahDwe

We might object that an action can be evaluated differently depending on intentions, but Mill continues to deny,
arguing that intentions only make a moral difference to our evaluation of someone as a person. But this can
be questioned... ^RWwh7nAz
