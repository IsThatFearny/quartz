# Truth Tracking
</br>

## What is 'Truth Tracking'?

S knows that P IFF
- P is true
- S believes that P
- If P were not true, S would not believe that P
- If P were true, S would believe that P

The statement that 'If P were not true, S would not believe that P' is a counterfactual, a statement about how things would be in a different world

e.g. Dodgy Zoo vs Honest Zoo
In this circumstance, the honest zoo has real zebras, and the dodgy zoo has one real zebra, while the rest are cleverly-disguised mules. In the dodgy zoo, the statement 'there is a zebra in front of me' is not knowledge because it could be a cleverly disguised mule. This is because if I had looked at the other zebra, I would have been looking at the other zebra, I would have been looking at a fake zebra. So my knowledge when I'm looking at the real zebra seems accidental. This picks up on our concerns about the 'context' in which knowledge is formed (e.g. Fake Barn County)

It is important that our beliefs track the truth, i.e. that they change as the facts change

## Summary

In the case of Fake Barn County, Henry would have believed that he was looking at a real barn even if he was looking at a fake barn. Therefore, according to tracking theory, Henry does not know that there is a barn in front of him, even when faced with a real barn
