# The University Debate

</br>
## What does the ‘University Debate’’ tell us about religious language?

</br>

### Flew’s parable of The Gardener (after John Wisdom)

Two people find a garden in the middle of the jungle. One believes that there is a gardener, but the other does not. They watch and wait to find this gardener. Despite not finding the gardener, one continues to believe in his existence and begins to find additional reasons to ‘support’ his claims, despite a lack of evidence. Flew argues that the believer’s faith dies a **’death by a thousand qualifications’**, i.e. moving the goalposts to excuse the lack of evidence.

This would seem to mean that religious language is meaningless, as it can neither be falsified nor verified. Believers continue to have faith in spite of a lack of evidence. The nature of religious language is that it cannot be shown to be meaningful.

### Hare on Bliks

A **[[Philosophy/Glossary#blik|blik]]** is an attitude towards the world/way of understanding the world. E.g. David is terrified of Dr Sheppard, and is convinced that DJS is out to kill him. Despite all evidence to the contrary, David remains convinced. We can say that this is a **blik**. The meaning of religious language is in the impact the belief has on the way one interacts with the world. ‘God exists’ means that you behave in certain ways. Believers are not making a truth claim, they are referring to their own perspective.

### Mitchell’s parable of the partisan and the stranger

In a war, a man meets a stranger and is convinced that the stranger is on his side because he is seen helping people on the partisan’s side. The man (partisan) sees evidence that the stranger is working for the enemy but remains convinced that the stranger is on his side.

This is different from Hare’s story because a) his initial belief is based on evidence; and b) the partisan entertains doubts and is willing to be proved wrong. Mitchell accepts Flew’s claim that religious language is cognitive/makes truth claims, but also argues that religious language is meaningful because believers consider evidence and reason; faith is not wholly blind.

### Flew’s concluding remarks

Flew accepts that Mitchell is right to say that believers do accept reasons against, e.g. the existence of God; they seek explanations for events which oppose their beliefs. However, the stranger is not analogous with God and so God’s actions cannot be ‘explained away’ as the stranger’s can be. So the believer is reduced to mere qualifications instead (i.e. moving the goalposts). 

Hare’s *bliks* do not properly account of religious language:

1) if it were merely a world view, it would not have either the impact or explanatory power which believers intend (‘Do $x$ because God says so’ becomes ‘do $x$’).
2) Believers intend their assertions to be understood cognitively - they are making, and believe that they are making, claims about, e.g. the creation of the world.
