# How Successful is Indirect Realism as a Theory of Perception?

</br>

### Explain Locke's argument for the existence of the external world from coherence

Locke argues that we can confirm the existence of the external world through the coherence of sense-data. If a sense-datum from one sense corroborates with another from a different sense, and if these are coherent with even more sense-data, then we can say with relative certainty that the external world exists, as we can confirm that our senses correspond with each other. 

</br>

### Explain Locke and Trotter Cockburn's argument for the existence of the external world from coherence?

Locke notes that we can confirm the existence of the external world through coherence of sense-data. Trotter Cockburn adds to this, noting that we can create associations between senses, e.g. I see a dog, and can confirm that the dog is there by hearing its bark, the sound of which I have associated with the dog.

</br>

### How does Locke bring these arguments together in an extended example?

Locke's extended example is this: I know from experience that I can change the way that a piece of paper looks by writing on it. I can know in advance what the paper will look like (as I can plan what I will write). But I have to actually write to bring about the sense-data associated with seeing the paper, and once I have written something, I cannot change the words that I see. This serves to show that sense-data is not controlled by imagination. The final confirmation of the external world in this example is that I can get someone else to read aloud what I have written, and this 'leaves little reason for doubt' that the paper and the words written upon it are independent of my mind.

### Explain Lacewing's claim that 'we have very good reason to claim that physical objects exist and cause our sense-data'

Lacewing claims this because he believes that, if physical objects don't exist, then we can't explain:

- Why sense-data aren't under our control, and yet imagination and memory are
- Why we get the same information from different senses
- Why we can infer perceptual experiences from one sense
- The interaction between actions and perceptions

</br>

### Explain the claim that the existence of mind-independent objects is not a hypothesis and how an indirect realist might respond

Indirect Realism responds to the criticism that the existence of physical objects is merely a hypotheses by rejecting Locke, Russel and Trotter Cockburn's theories. They seem to argue that sense-data comes between us and physical objects, whereas Indirect Realism argues that sense-data is simply a medium through which we view the external world. The existence of the external world is therefore not a hypothesis, but something that we experience in perception.

##### Revised

The existence of mind-independent objects is not a hypothesis (This is a direct response to Russel - existence of the external world is 'best hypothesis'. The external world is more than just a hypothesis - it is something we experience every day; Russel's argument is weaker than it needs to be: indirect realism claims that we experience the external world through the medium of sense-data, not that sense data gets in the way as Locke and Russel seem to assume.
</br>

### What does Locke mean by saying that physical objects 'resemble' our sense data?

Locke means that there are systematic correlations between our perception of and the nature of the external world. Our concepts of shape and size are similar to the concepts of shape and size that exist in the external world. Locke says that perception is the source of our knowledge of not only the existence of  mind-independent objects, but also something of their nature.

##### Revised

Physical objects resemble the shape and size of my sense-data There are systematic correlations between our experiences and the external world, e.g. our perception/experience of time follows the universal order of time.

### Outline the questions that resemblance raises,  Locke's response, and further questions that arise

One important question that resemblance raises is that of 'what are physical objects really like?' and how can we know which properties are true to our perception. Locke's answer to this is his concept of primary and secondary qualities. However, we can then ask 'how do we know that physical objects have primary qualities that resemble our experience of them?'. We cannot tell the properties of a cause from its effects. Is it possible to rule out the claim that physical objects, while causing our experiences of qualities, don't actually resemble said experiences?

##### Revised

- What are physical objects really like?
- Which properties do they really have?
- How can we differentiate between appearance and reality?

Because Locke's claim is one of correlation, not identity, I cannot know which properties actually exist in the object.

### Explain Berkeley's two arguments that indirect realism leads to scepticism about the nature of physical objects

Berkely objects to indirect realism, arguing that our sense-data, which is are 'perpetually fleeting and variable' cannot resemble physical objects, which are 'fixed and constant'. We cannot distinguish the 'true copy'. Secondly, Berkely asks, how can something that we cannot experience (a mind-independent object) resemble a mind-dependent object? Our ideas of qualities derive from our perceptual experiences, and therefore we cannot know the true nature of mind-independent physical objects.

##### Revised

N.B. Responses to this include coherence of senses; involuntary nature and perception; and external world being the best hypothesis.

Berkely says that:

1) Sense data cannot resemble physical objects as they have very different properties. Sense data is 'fleeting and variable', but physical objects are 'fixed and constant'. If our sense data is changeable, it is unclear how we can know what the reality of a physical object is. Perceptual Variation applies as much to Indirect Realism as Direct Realism.
2) We experience sense-data but we do not experience physical objects - therefore, one cannot be like, or resemble, the other, because they have different properties. (This shows the importance of sense experience. We can only know what we experience - empiricism)
