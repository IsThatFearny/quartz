# Conditions (Truth, Justification, Belief)
</br>

## The Truth Condition
The truth condition is fairly uncontroversial. It states that for something to be classed as knowledge, it must be true. Just because you think you know something does not mean that you actually know it, because if it is false, then it is not actually knowledge, but a belief.
</br>

<aside>Knowledge requires true belief, as truth exists in the correspondence between belief and fact</aside>
</br>
The truth condition becomes more hotly debated when an understanding of truth is required. A popular definition is a correspondence between belief and objective reality. Simply put, if you believe that something is the case, and in reality it is, then the case is true, and vice versa. 
</br>


However, there are also other definitions of truth, such as the coherence theory, which states that a belief is true if it is part of a 'web of beliefs' held by society to be true.<aside>What we think is true now may be proven false in future. We cannot claim to know real truth</aside> This belief integrates and relies upon other beliefs, whether justified or not. This web of beliefs is inescapable, as we hold certain things to be true, and it is entirely possible that our web of beliefs contains falsehoods within it. According to this theory, people in different time periods 'knew' things that we have now proven false, but their knowledge is not invalidated by our evidence.

##### Revised
e.g claiming the earth is flat: it looks flat, things would roll of the edge, = compelling evidence

## The Justification Condition

A claim without the ability to justify by means of evidence is simply an unsubstantiated assertion. If this is the case then the belief is based on irrational concepts rather than facts or evidence. e.g. a racist juror may find a defendant guilty, which is true, but they found this judgement based on their irrational racism, and not the evidence presented. Therefore an unjustified true belief is not knowledge. This means we need justification criteria to distinguish knowledge from a guess/estimate

<aside>Can this reliable process be seen as a justification?</aside>
However, some philosophers claim that a reliable process that produces true beliefs is what counts as knowledge

</br>

## The Belief Condition

You cannot know something without believing it, e.g. 'I know that it is raining but I do not believe it'. This is clearly nonsense. 

There is also an argument that says that knowledge and belief are incompatible, as knowledge is infallible and belief is fallible. e.g. 'Can you drive to Leicester?' 'I don't know how to get there'. But person 2 manages to get to Leicester anyway, so they clearly know how to get there, despite the fact that they did not believe it.

On the other hand, this is focused on acquaintance knowledge, and it seems that knowledge is unconscious - belief operates at a more conscious level - it is more uncertainty or modesty rather than 'lack' of belief
