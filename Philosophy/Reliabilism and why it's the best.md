# Reliabilism and why it is the best

Suppose that I am not a brain in a vat. Perception is thus a reliable process (a process by which a high percentage of true beliefs are formed). I therefore gain knowledge from sense experience, and do not need justification for my beliefs. I also do not need to know that I am not a brain in a vat. If I am not a brain in a vat, then, because perception is a reliable cognitive process, I can know that physical objects exist.

It is important to note that there is no reason to think that my knowing of a proposition relies upon my knowing that I know said proposition, for example animals may know things but not be able to think about said knowledge.

Therefore, we do not need to know that we are not brains in vats in order to have knowledge about the external world.
