# The role of God in Berkley's Idealism

</br>

### How does Berkley understand physical objects?

Berkley understands physical objects as mind-dependent 'bundles of ideas', made up of our perceptions of physical object.

</br>

### How does Berkley account for the cause of our perceptions?

Berkley states that there are only three possible causes of our perceptions: ideas, my mind, or another mind. He rejects the first, as ideas are incapable of causing anything. He goes on to argue that the second is invalid also, as if our perceptions stemmed from our own minds, we would surely be able to control them. He is therefore left with only one conclusion: that our perceptions are caused by another mind, namely God's. The conclusion that the mind must be God's comes from the idea that the only possible mind who could create such systematic and complex perceptions is God's.

</br>

### Why, according to Berkley, can ideas not be causes?

Berkley asks whether our perceptions cause our experiences of them, or does the mind perceive? He concludes that the latter option is better. He states that ideas are passive, and cannot 'make' us think anything. Only the mind (which is active) can cause perceptions.

</br>

### Why, according to Berkley, is it not reasonable to suggest that matter causes our perceptions?

Berkely responds to an argument made by Hylas as follows:

P1: Matter (as it is normally defined) cannot exist (as previously asserted).

C1: Therefore, to talk of matter, we must conceive of it as our perception of it.

P2: We only perceive ideas.

C2: Therefore, given that ideas are passive, mind must cause our perceptions, and matter cannot cause them.

</br>

### Explain the claim that 'Berkley is aware that his idealism is counter-intuitive... [but] there is nothing impossible about his conclusion'

Berkley argues that his conclusion is perfectly reasonable, given his previous arguments, and that this simply follows on from them. From experience, we know that thoughts and ideas may arise from the mind.

</br>

### Explain the claim that 'the existence of God is an inference' for Berkley

Berkley simply states that the existence of God is inferred and simply the logical conclusion in his arguments, also saying that any mind that can produce our perceptions and our ideas must be 'wise, powerful, and good, beyond anything that I can perceive'. He therefore concludes that such a mind must be God's, and says that this can be inferred logically.

#### Revised

God is an inference - the logical conclusion of his argument. He arrives at this conclusion, he is not setting out to prove that God exists! The criticism that 'we cannot know that God exists' is not a suitable analysis.

</br>

### Explain the problem with Berkley's claim that ideas exist in the mind of God, and Berkley's response to this objection

The problem with Berkley's claim is this:

P1: Our perceptions and sensations are part of our minds. They are in *our* minds, not God's/

P2: God does not perceive as we do, and therefore cannot feel sensations or have the same experiences.

P3: The ordinary objects of my perception may be variable, but God's mind is unchanging and eternal.

C1: Therefore, what I perceive and feel cannot be part of God's mind.

Berkley defends his argument by clarifying it: 

1) What we perceive is a mere copy of what is in God's mind.
2) God does not perceive, but instead understands. He knows what it is like for us to feel sensation or to perceive as we do.
3) Everything that changes in our perception is by the will of God.
