## a) What is Aristotle's concept of 'the good'?

</br>

### How does virtue ethics principally differ from Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology?

Utilitarianism and Kant are act-centred approaches: they focus on the question 'what is a moral action?'. Virtue Ethics, by contrast, is an agent-centred approach: it begins with the question 'what is a good person?' - following which, 'what actions does a moral person perform?'

N.B. As there is a contrast with Utilitarianism on the act/agent distribution there is also a similarity with Utilitarianism that separates the two from deontology - namely, like Utilitarianism, Virtue Ethics is a teleological/consequentialist approach focused on outcomes/ends. Thus, both Utilitarianism and Virtue Ethics focus on the achievement (end) of happiness, though they understand happiness in markedly different ways.

</br>

### Explain Aristotle's proof that the end we desire for its own sake, not the sake of anything else, is the good for human beings

Aristotle's 'proof' that we desire the good (for humans) for its own sake: 

1) All our activities aim at a perceived good (e.g. I brush my teeth with the aim of maintaining dental health, which I perceive to be a good outcome)
2) If there is one good that all activities aim at in the end, then this is *the* good  for all human beings
3) There is such a final good, namely Eudaimonia, the only good that we desire for its own sake and not for the sake of anything else (i.e. Eudaimonia is an end in itself)

</br>

## b) Eudaimonia

</br>

### Aristotle argues that the good for a human like if eudaimonia. What is eudaimonia and how does it differ from the ordinary idea of 'happiness'?

If the human good is happiness is Eudaimonia - what is Eudaimonia? The traditional translation of Eudaimonia has been happiness. But this is problematic: Virtue Ethics does not mean happiness as hedonistic Utilitarianism understands it - i.e. as pleasure alone. This should also dissuade from imagining Eudaimonia in terms of an emotional state ('happy' as in 'good humoured and smiling a lot' - something we might reproduce via drugs - it is not to do with serotonin levels). Rather, it has to do with a wider sense of human flourishing/success/excellence/a life lived well/the fulfilment of potential. The eudaimon life is thus the life in which human potential is most completely fulfilled.

</br>

### Explain Aristotle's argument that Eudaimonia is our final end

Is there such a thing as *the* good for humans? Given that we consider various qualities as human goods (e.g. pleasure, honour, knowledge, wealth, etc.) how can we say that eudaimonia is our only or final good?

Aristotle's argument is that we seek those other goods for the sake of something else - that something else is eudaimonia (i.e. we want health because we consider it an 'ingredient' of eudaimonia). Eudaimonia is the one good that we want for its own sake and not for the sake of any further end. It is the final good.

</br>

## c) The function argument

</br>
N.B. The function argument is central to Aristotle's response to the question 'what is happiness (eudaimonia)?'. In short, Aristotle says that the question can be answered only if we can establish the natural 'function' (ergon) of humans.
</br></br>

### Explain Aristotle's concepts of 'function' and 'virtue'

Aristotle's concept of function is generally defined as the 'characteristic form of an activity'. This can provide an insight into what type of thing something is. It can thus provide an evaluative standard, from which we are able to work out whether something is 'good' or does something 'well'. The concept of 'virtue' can be defined as a quality that fulfils the function, such as sharpness in a knife.

#### Revised
The function of $x$ is the characteristic activity of $x$ - hence, the function of a toaster is toasting bread (and this knowledge is required in order to judge whether a given toaster is a 'good' toaster - it is a toaster that toasts bread well). Everything in nature has a function, according to Aristotle: this is the basic claim of his natural teleology. Thus, as natural beings, we can ask the function question of human beings.

Virtues are the traits (qualities) that enable natural things to fulfil their function - thus, the function of the eye is to see; the 'virtue' of the eye that enables it to fulfil this function is the power of sight (blindness is the absence of this virtue that prevents the eye from fulfilling its function). The translation 'virtue' (from the Greek *arete*) is the accepted on,e but the danger is that we view *arete* in a narrowly moral sense - it is thus sometimes translate as 'excellence' - the quality possessed by $x$ that enables it to be a brilliant example of $x$. 
</br>

### Outline and explain Aristotle's function argument

Aristotle states that the characteristic activity of a human life is to make decisions guided by reason, and he talks about this in terms of activity of the soul (due to being guided by reasoning being a matter of psychology). Simply, our *ergon* is to live as a rational animal. The virtues of a human being  must therefore be what enables us to do this. Aristotle says that to fulfil our 'function' we must be guided by the 'right' and 'good' reasons. Therefore, he says, eudaimonia is living a life in which one exercises human virtues.

#### Revised
Aristotle considers three options:

1) Is the human function to be a living organism? He rejects this as the specific function of humans because it is shared with *all* living organisms
2) Is the human function to have sense experience (to be 'sensate')? Aristotle rejects this because humans share this ability with all members of the animal kingdom
3) This leaves the third option: the life guided by reason, which is unique to humans and thereby it concludes, our peculiar function.

N.B. 'Reason as the human function' - more specifically, Aristotle's point is that when humans act, they act for reasons (i.e. their action is purposive). As such, reason is the activity of the human mind/soul (psyche). To live the good human life is to live in accordance with good reasons, and to do this we need to possess virtues (virtues of character and virtues of intellect). Eudaimonia is the rational practice of virtue.
</br>

### Explain Aristotle's argument that eudaimonia involves virtue, pleasure and prosperity

Aristotle argues that eudaimonia consist of virtue, pleasure and prosperity. In terms of virtue, he argues that it is not enough to simply possess virtue, but that we must act on it in order to fulfil eudaimonia. In terms of pleasure, Aristotle's argument is that a virtuous person must love living virtuously in order to be virtuous and fulfil eudaimonia. This means that eudaimonia is both good and pleasant. Finally, in terms of prosperity (i.e. wealth), good fortune is required in order to live well (through philanthropy, generosity, altruism, etc.) and therefore some level of wealth or prosperity is required to fulfil eudaimonia.

#### Revised
Eudaimonia involves:

- Virtue: To 'possess' virtue is insufficient - one must act in accordance with virtue, i.e. practice virtue - act excellently, do courageous/generous/wise acts, etc.

- Pleasure: Aristotle is not a hedonist in the manner of Mill and Bentham - he does not think that 'happiness = pleasure'. However, this does not mean that Virtue Ethics is 'anti-pleasure'. For Aristotle, pleasure is part of happiness. To experience Eudaimonia - to 'be happy' is a pleasant experience - it involves pleasure. The point is that pleasure is not the final end/aim (as it is for Utilitarianism). So, the good life involves pleasure (but pleasure is not the ultimate aim of the good life). In short, it is entirely natural that humans gain pleasure from virtuous actions.

- Prosperity: Aristotle is not squeamish about making the point that Eudaimonia is more rather than less likely if a given individual possesses material prosperity - which provides additional life opportunities, better access to healthcare, etc. - good looks, honourable parents, and so on. N.B. A more literal translation of eudaimonia is 'well-blessed'.
</br>

### Explain Aristotle's account of the soul

Aristotle says that we are able to divide the soul into two distinct parts: rational and arational. The arational part can be divided again, into 'growth and nutrition' and 'desire and emotion'. Whilst we share our desire with animals, in us it can align with and be responsive to reason. If the two *do* align, then the virtue which is being exercised truly is a virtue. The same is true for the rational part of the soul. Here, the two parts are 'desire' and 'reason'. Desire is much the same as in the arational part of the brain. The reason part has reason 'in itself'. There are, therefore, two types of virtues: of intellect (traits of the reasoning part) and of character (traits of the desire and emotion part).

#### Revised
Aristotle says that the soul is divided into rational and non-rational parts. The non-rational part of the soul can be sub-divided into a part concerned with 'growth and nutrition' and a part concerned with 'feelings and emotions'. The 'growth and nutrition' part is not the focus of ethical attention in that it is not concerned with our choices (rather with our biology). So, the focus is the following:

</br>

| Rational            | Non-Rational         |
|:--------------------|:---------------------|
| Reason (Thought)    | Feelings/Emotions    |
| Intellect           | Character            |
| Intellectual Virtue | Virtues of Character |
| Cognitive           | Non-Cognitive        |  

</br>
The soul has two parts that have different functions (One concerned with thinking well, the other a function concerned with feeling/emoting well), to fulfil which function each part has its corresponding virtues - thus, virtues of intellect and virtues of character.
</br> 

## d) Aristotle's account of the virtues

</br>

### Explain Aristotle's conception of a state (or trait) of character

Aristotle says that a virtue is a state of character. A state of character is 'the things in virtue of which we stand well or badly with reference to the passions' (the passions being bodily appetites, emotions, and feelings derived from pleasure or pain). Character involves a person's dispositions that relate to how they feel, act, react, etc. This has a certain stability and longevity. They are therefore different to states of mind, which are relatively fleeting and much more subject to change. They are central to being the person that one is.

#### Revised
An individual's 'character' describes their emotional disposition (N.B. You describe someone's emotional disposition when you answer the question 'what is $x$ like?' - What sort of emotions do they present?)

By 'passions', Aristotle means emotions and feelings accompanied by pleasure and pain. Having a particular emotion does not make the possessor good or bad. We don't choose our emotions (but   virtues are related to the choices we make  - the point is that we are rarely able to choose to feel in a certain way). 

Aristotle defines states of character (emotional dispositions) as things in virtue of which we stand well or badly with reference to the passions

</br>

### What is Aristotle's account of a moral virtue (or virtue of character)?


Some traits of character, Aristotle says, prevent us from leading a good life and living well, and these are known as vices. Traits of character that help us to lead a good life are the virtues. In order to achieve eudaimonia, Aristotle says that we must choose well, and our virtues shape our decisions. Therefore, they must be good.

#### Revised
There are two types of virtue: virtues of intellect (there are two: theoretical wisdom and practical wisdom - see later notes) and virtues of character (there are many). Virtues of character (Lacewing calls them 'moral virtues') There are many such virtues because there are many 'passions' (feelings/emotions) that humans experience - many emotional states. But as there are virtues related to these states so there are also vices. Virtues enable us to feel/emote/desire well, an the vices describe when we fail to respond appropriately - i.e. morally - to our desires/feelings/emotions.

Practical wisdom is essential here in that it is the rational part of the sou that chooses what the appropriate response to an 'emotional situation' is in the particular circumstances. E.g. a young child spills Ribena on your new white rug. Your emotional state is one of anger: do you possess the virtue of character corresponding to this emotion *and* the practical wisdom to decide what is the correct way to exhibit this virtue in your response?
</br>

## e) The doctrine of the mean

</br>

### Outline Aristotle's doctrine of the mean (with reference to the distinction between mean and moderation)

Aristotle says that we need an 'intermediate' course of action to live well (i.e. not too much nor too little). He calls this the 'mean'. This is relative to each individual (e.g. a professional sportsman might need more food and exercise than others). We can feel our passions too much or too little. Virtue involves being disposed to feeling in an 'intermediate' way. Someone may get angry too often, or not enough. To be virtuous is to feel our passions at the right times and express them in the right way (right amount, towards the right people, with the right motive). The doctrine of the mean, however, does not state that we should only ever feel our passions 'moderately'. We should feel them as the situation demands.

#### Revised

So, how do we decide what the correct (i.e. virtuous) response to a situation is? Aristotle offers the doctrine of the mean as a guide. We can feel our emotions "too much" or "too little". We possess natural dispositions to feel and desire (e.g. the experience of fear is natural to humans). The virtue that enables us to fear well/appropriately (i.e. virtuously) is courage. The courageous disposition to adopt in a given context in which fear is experienced is the ‘mean’ between excess and deficiency. In the sphere of feeling or action related to fear, the excess is rashness and the deficiency is cowardice. Courage is the mean between the two. (N.B. we need practical wisdom to determine what is courageous in a given context - see later notes)

In short, the virtue lies ‘in the mean’ - it is a disposition to feel an emotion appropriately (as Aristotle says, ‘at the right time, with reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way’)

The point is that a ‘courageous disposition’ is developed/trained by reason making a series of good decisions - i.e. courage becomes a habit (ethos). The doctrine of the mean is not a doctrine of ‘moderation in all things’ or ‘always take the middle path’. Rather, what counts as the mean depends on the circumstances (e.g. it might be appropriate to show considerable anger towards the drunk driver, but very little anger towards the toddler who spills the glass of milk). 
</br>

### Explain how the doctrine of the mean is applied to at least two of the virtues named in Aristotle's table of virtues

- Fear: If one shows too little fear, they are considered to be rash (vice of excess) If someone shows too much fear, they are cowardly (vice of deficiency). Being courageous is the mean of these, and is therefore a virtue.

- Anger: If someone is barely ever angry, then they are considered unflappable (vice of deficiency). If they are quick to anger, then they are short-tempered (vice of excess). The mean of these is good-tempered, and therefore this is a virtue.

#### Revised

| Sphere of Action/Feeling |  Excess   |   Mean   |   Deficiency    |
|:------------------------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------------:|
|     Fear/Confidence      | Rashness  | Courage  |    Cowardice    |
|          Anger           | Irascible | Patience |    Passivity    |
|          Shame           |  Shyness  | Modesty  |  Shamelessness  |
|      Social Conduct      | Flattery (Kiss-Arse)  | Friendly | Cantankerousness (Hostile)| 


</br>

### What is the role of education in the development of moral character?

Aristotle argues that we acquire virtues through habit. We are not simply virtuous by nature. These habits are formed particularly throughout our upbringing and our education. Aristotle says that virtues must be learned and then practised in order to be carried out in the right way.

#### Revised

Education is central to the acquisition of virtue - we acquire virtue through habituation (i.e. upbringing) (N.B. we do not learn virtue through ‘theory’ but through practice - i.e. by performing virtuous actions)

</br>

### Explain the skills analogy in Aristotle's theory of how we acquire virtues

Take a practical skill, playing a music instrument for example. To acquire the skill, we must not only learn the theory, but must also practise the skill. This applies to virtues as well, as we must exercise them before we can do them well. There is then a second part to the analogy. To properly exercise virtues, we must exercise them independently. This means that after we learn from others, we must learn to think for ourselves. Instead of simply following rules, the student of the skill must have a deeper understanding of their skill and what makes it work. The same is true for virtues. The student of virtues comes to learn *why* one action is better than another, or associates a certain virtue with a certain scenario.

#### Revised

Aristotle draws the skills analogy between acquiring virtue and acquiring a practical skill - we acquire virtue not by being told what is right (just as the pianist did not learn by being told which key to touch)rather by doing virtuous acts (for the pianist, sitting at a piano and practising scales, etc.). The skill analogy contains a further element - just as the good pianist develops an expertise that takes them beyond the ‘rules’ for playing piano, so the virtuous person goes beyond rules to making their own judgements based on good reasons in specific contexts.

</br>

## f) Practical wisdom (phronesis)

</br>

### What is Aristotle's account of practical wisdom?

Practical wisdom (i.e. phronesis) is an intellectual virtue of practical reasoning. Practical reasoning investigates what we are able to change, and aims at making good choices (as opposed to theoretical reasoning, which aims at discovering the truth about what we cannot change). In order to make good choices, we must have the right desires and the right reasoning behind our actions. Someone with practical wisdom is able to deliberate well about how to live a good live. Practical wisdom can therefore be defined as 'a true and reasoned state or capacity to act with regard to the things that are good or bad for man'.

#### Revised

There is a rational part of the soul, and its function is to reason. The virtue of theoretical wisdom (theoria) enables it to reason well in relation to maths, physics, etc. Meanwhile - and importantly from an ethical point of view - practical wisdom (phronesis) enables it to reason well in relation to human choices and actions. 

N.B. To make good choices we also need to possess good desires - thus the link between intellect and character to choose the right action is more likely if we feel like doing it!

Phronesis is a ‘reasoned state or capacity to act with regard to things that are good or bad for man’. Thus, it involves a) insight into what is good or bad in general; b) insight into what is good and bad in particular contexts; and c) the ability to deliberate well (i.e. understand the range of possible actions and judge their respective merits - working out the means to the end) and act on that deliberation.
</br>

### Explain Aristotle's claim that practical wisdom is not merely knowledge of moral rules

Aristotle claims that, while it does involve a general conception of moral 'rules' and what is 'good' and 'bad', practical wisdom is much more than this. It also requires the ability to deliberate well, and the ability to act on said deliberation. This deliberation must be to a good end, with the right means, and be done in a timely fashion.

#### Revised

Ethics is concerned with finding the appropriate (i.e. virtuous) action in the particular circumstances. Thus, there is no set of moral rules that could hope to capture what is virtuous given the variety of human experiences. Phronesis seeks to grasp the relevant facts of particular situations. 

N.B. as a consequence, knowledge of what is practical and virtuous cannot be taught - rather it relies on experience.

</br>

### Explain why Aristotle claims that practical wisdom requires virtue and virtue requires practical wisdom

If we are virtuous, then we aim to live a good life, and we know what this is. However, virtue alone cannot tell us how to live well in a particular situation. We need practical wisdom to identify the means to our ends. In addition to this, practical wisdom requires virtue. Practical wisdom must be applied only to good ends, and it is possible to deliberate from the wrong ends. To exercise practical wisdom, one must have a conception of 'right', 'wrong', 'good', and 'bad', and this conception is virtue. Therefore, both practical wisdom and virtue are reliant upon the other.

#### Revised

Aristotle argues that phronesis requires virtue and virtue requires phronesis (you can’t have one without the other!). In other words, to act in a virtuous way we must aim at the right end (outcome). This end is set by being virtuous. But we must also understand what we are doing, understood as a means to that end - thus understanding is provided by practical wisdom. Therefore, we cannot have virtue without practical wisdom because virtue involves fully virtuous action. And we cannot have phronesis without virtue because phronesis involves general knowledge of what is good, and we can’t have this knowledge without being virtuous.

</br>

## g) Aristotle on Eudaimonia, Pleasure and Philosophy

</br>

### Explain Aristotle’s rejection of the argument that Eudaimonia has nothing to do with pleasure

Criticism: The temperate (mean) person avoids pleasure
Response: This is incorrect. The temperate person simply avoids *an excess* of pleasure

Criticism: The practically wise person avoids pain, but does not seek pleasure
Response: The practically wise person seeks pleasure *within reason*. Their avoidance of pain is evidence that pleasure is good, and should therefore be pursued

Criticism: Pleasure interferes with thought
Response: The pleasures of thinking do not interfere with thinking, but instead assist it. Pleasures that arise from other places can interfere with thinking, but it is not the pleasure that arises from thought that does this. This is generally true for most pleasurable activities

Criticism: Not all pleasures are good
Response: If bodily pleasures are not good, then how can we say that their inverse, bodily pains, are bad? In this case, it is only an excess of pleasure that is bad. A bad pleasure is only good to *bad people*.

#### Revised

N.B. Whereas hedonistic utilitarianism argues that ‘pleasure happiness’ - i.e. pleasure is *the* good - Aristotle argues that pleasure is *a* good (i.e. it ‘contributes to’ eudaimonia).

Aristotle argues that:

a) the self-controlled individual doesn’t avoid all pleasure, only an excess of physical pleasure;

b) the phronemon (practically wise person) seeks pleasure in accordance with reason. Indeed, that the phronemon avoids pain itself shows that pleasure is good; 

c) pleasure does not interfere with thought. Of course, this may be the case in some circumstances - one pleasure may interfere with another - but it is not true as such. Pleasure of thinking assist thinking, not hinder it.

d) no pleasures are inherently bad, only pleasures experienced to excess (disgraceful pleasures aren’t true pleasures).
</br>

### Explain Aristotle’s positive argument that pleasure is good

Here, Aristotle considers four arguments from Eudoxus. The first and strongest reason for pleasure being good is that every creature aims at pleasure. This indicates that for each thing, pleasure is good. And if this is true for all things, then pleasure is *the* good. The three other reasons are as follows:
 
1) Everything avoids pain, so its contrary, pleasure, is good
2) We choose pleasure for its own sake, not for some further purpose
3) Adding pleasure onto any good makes it more desirable

Aristotle therefore concludes that pleasure is good.

#### Revised

a) Every creature aims at pleasure for its own sake (but pleasure is not our only aim, so not the good itself).

b) Everyone avoids pain, so the contrary must be good.

c) We choose pleasure for its own sake

d) Adding pleasure onto any good makes it more desirable

</br>

### Explain Aristotle’s claim that pleasure is not the only good

Aristotle claims that pleasure is not the only good. He says that we seek out other things such as knowledge, sight, and virtue, even if attaining these gives us no pleasure. These ‘final ends’ must be good, as we desire them, and therefore pleasure cannot be the only good.

#### Revised

Pleasure is a good but not the only good (contrast with hedonistic utilitarianism). There are other ends, besides pleasure, Aristotle argues, for which we aim - e.g. seeing, knowing, being virtuous - that are final ends and not simply means to pleasure.

</br>

### Outline Aristotle’s analysis of the nature of pleasure

Aristotle argues that pleasure is the ‘unimpeded activity of our faculties’. To explain this, let us use the example of sight.  Pleasure in this case is caused most when we are able to see well, and active in relation to its ‘finest’ object (the finest object being something on which we may exercise sight in this case, so a painting or a landscape). Looking at such things gives us pleasure. The same is true for thought. We take pleasure in exercising our thought with something that engages us, but does not *impede* our thought. This can be extended to all of our activities.

This pleasure is not a separate entity, but ‘completes’ and adds to the activity that we are performing. The pleasure is inherent in the activity, and intensifies and supports it. Therefore, when we enjoy an activity, we are likely to take a greater interest in it, and enjoy it less if we are distracted.

In addition, Aristotle says that a pleasure is good when the activity associated with it is good, and vice versa.

#### Revised

Pleasure is the unimpeded activity of a faculty. As such, it is not a psychological state (state of ‘excitement’ or ‘joy’) caused by pleasurable activity, rather it is part of the activity - specifically its intensification and its completion (in the teleological sense of fulfilment of purpose, not end point).
</br>

### What is theoretical reason?

Theoretical reason is ‘the contemplation of truth’, and what is ‘highest’ about human beings. It distinguishes us from animals, who have practical reason, but do not contemplate general truths. Eudaimonia must include ‘excellent activity’ of theoretical reason (this is philosophy).

#### Revised

Theoretical reason is reasoning concerned with truths that we cannot change (that cannot be otherwise than they are). Aristotle thought that the universe was eternal and ‘fixed’ thus he considered the study of astronomy (the planets and their rotation) as a matter of theoretical reason.

The activity of theoretical reasoning brings the individual closest to god - the capacity for theoretical reasoning is like a ’divine spark’. God, in Aristotle’s definition, is ‘pure theoretical reasoning’, so when humans engage in theoretical reasoning they ‘imitate’ God, and so most closely fulfil their human purpose.

</br>

### Outline Aristotle’s argument that the life of the philosopher is the best human life

P1: This activity (philosophy) is best because it is the best thing in us, and with it we contemplate what is best (not for ourselves, but for the universe)

P2: We can undertake this activity continuously (to a greater extent than any other activity)

P3: The pleasures derived from this activity are the most pure and enduring

P4: It is the most self-sufficient activity. We undertake it for its own sake, and gain nothing.

P5: We are active in order to have leisure (leisure being undertaking the activities that we wish to undertake)

P6: Theoretical reason is our characteristic activity, our *ergon*

C1: Therefore, the best life for us (most pleasant) will be a life of reason, dedicated to knowledge.

</br>

## h) Aristotle on voluntary action, choice, and responsibility
</br>

### Explain Aristotle’s distinction between voluntary and involuntary action

Aristotle says that there are two things that may render our actions to be involuntary - force and ignorance. When we act voluntarily, we are aware of what we are doing, and bring it about ourselves. 

- Force: If we are forced by negative psychological or physical pressures to do something, we are absolved of blame. It must, however, be noted that just because we don’t want to do something does not make it an involuntary action. e.g. sailors throwing goods overboard in a storm. We may praise or blame these acts, and this is only associate with voluntary action.

- Ignorance: Some actions may come about as a result of ignorance (e.g. stepping on someone’s foot because you didn’t know that it was there). If you regret this action, then it is involuntary, as you did not choose, for example, to step on their foot. You are not ignorant of the end, but you are ignorant of the circumstances of the action or the other consequences of the action. It is important to distinguish between acting ‘in ignorance’ as opposed to ‘from ignorance’. For example, actions that you perform while drunk may still have blame attached to them, even if you were ignorant of what you were doing. Here, you act *in* ignorance, not *from* ignorance.

Therefore, voluntary action can be defined as something which you bring about, with knowledge of what you are doing.
</br>

### Outline Aristotle’s theory of choice and deliberation

Aristotle defines ‘choice’ in the negative:

- It is not desire - someone who gives into temptation acts on desire, against their choice, and vice versa

- It is not ‘wish’ - you may wish for that which is impossible, and for things over which you have no control. Choice relates to something which is within our capabilities. In addition, we wish ends, but choose the means to those ends, so the two are separate

- It is not an opinion - opinions are true or false, but choices are good or bad

Choice therefore relates to voluntary action, where this is done on the basis of deliberation.

Aristotle goes on to define deliberation. We may only deliberate about things that we are capable of changing. We deliberate on how to act in new circumstances, for example. In addition to this, deliberation is based upon means, not ends. When we deliberate, we have an end in view, and we consider which means to use to achieve that end. Deliberation of any ‘end’ can be said to be deliberation of the means with which to achieve the final end - leading a good life.

Choice is therefore what we decide upon as a result of deliberation.
</br>

### Construct a diagram explaining Aristotle’s argument for the claim that bad people are responsible for becoming bad

```argdown
[Statement]: Bad people are responsible for becoming bad
	+ Bad people are ignorant of the good
	+ Bad people act voluntarily
	+ Bad people desire what is not truly desirable
	+ Bad people became bad as a result of their choices
	
```

</br>

### Explain Aristotle’s defence of the claim that bad people are morally accountable for their bad actions

Aristotle argues that bad people became bad because of the choices that they made. Therefore, as their choices are their own (assuming that they were not being forced or pressured to make said choices), they are responsible for becoming bad, and responsible for becoming ignorant of what is good.
</br>

### What is Aristotle’s account of justice?

Justice is understood to be the disposition to do what is just, to act justly, and wish for justice. Aristotle argues that justice has two meanings:

1) The wider sense - Anything legal is just and anything illegal is unjust. Aristotle says that the law instructs us to be virtuous, and prohibits us from being vicious. Here, justice is therefore equivalent to virtue (in relation to how we treat other people)
2) The narrower sense - Justice is ‘fairness’. it is concerned with those goods which we can obtain an advantage in relation to others (e.g. money, safety, happiness). Injustice is seeking more than your fair share of these goods, or to avoid your fair share of that which is bad. Justice is the principle that everyone receives their ‘due’. Aristotle then goes on to say that there are two types of justice as fairness: the distribution of good and bad, in which people should receive goods according to their merit, and all are treated equally; and rectification, where injustice needs to be corrected (whatever is unequal to be made equal)

We can therefore say that Justice is the ‘mean’ between acting unjustly and being unjustly treated.
</br>

### Explain Aristotle’s account of the relation between justice and voluntary action

Aristotle clarifies the differences between unjust states of affairs, unjust acts, acting unjustly, and being unjust:

1) In an *unjust state of affairs*, there is an imbalance in distribution. However, this is not the result of the actions of an individual. For example, illness might cause loss of income.
2) An *unjust act* is that which results in injustice (unjust distribution). If the person is acting involuntarily, then it is merely unjust.
3) To perform an unjust act voluntarily is to *act unjustly*. If one acts voluntarily, but not by choice, then they may commit an unjust act, but not be an unjust person (lack of deliberation). For example, injuring someone through anger.
4) To perform an unjust act voluntarily, and by choice, then they are *being unjust*. This is the worst form of unjust act, as the person knows what they are doing and its consequences, and have deliberated over whether to perform the act.

It is also important to note that: 1) You cannot be treated unjustly voluntarily; and 2) you cannot treat yourself unjustly. In both cases, this is because the act is not against your wishes, and is therefore, by definition, not unjust. 

#### Revision

1) Unjust state of affairs: Unjust distribution (i.e. an individual group has less than is their due) - not the result of an ‘action’ as such.
2) Unjust act: An act which results in an unjust distribution - if the act is involuntary (i.e. the result of ignorance) if it is ‘merely’ unjust.
3) Acting unjustly: To commit an unjust act voluntarily is to act unjustly. The individual acts unjustly but isn’t an unjust person if it is voluntary but isn’t an unjust person if it is voluntary (i.e. Mesi hits Will) but not done by choice (that is, there was no deliberation preceding the action)
4) Being unjust: To do an unjust action by choice (i.e. with deliberation) is to be unjust. In short, the unjust person knows what they are doing

## i) Assessing Aristotelian Virtue Ethics
</br>

### Explain the objection that the doctrine of the mean provides no guidance on how to act and a possible response to it

‘Too much’ and ‘too little’ or not quantifiable. This is shown by Aristotle’s own doctrine of ‘right time, right object, right person, right motive, right way’ - things are clearly more complicated than too much or too little. In addition, the doctrine of the mean does not aid us in understanding, for example, how often we should get angry, and how angry we should get. In theory, any level of anger could be ‘the mean’ in a certain cert of circumstances.

Aristotle might respond to this by saying that the doctrine of the mean is not something to be used as guidance - this type of moral guidance must come from exercising practical wisdom. He says explicitly that the mean ‘is determined by the person of practical wisdom’.

#### Revised

The doctrine of the mean provides no guidance on how to act (N.B. contrast with Utilitarianism and Kant, which might be said to give very specific guidance). ‘Too much’ and ‘Too little’ are not quantities on a single scale, and the list of other factors of moral significance (right time, object, person, etc.) are very complicated and difficult to judge. Aristotle gives us no concrete criteria against which to judge one course of action over another.

Aristotle’s response? Such critics misunderstand his purpose, which isn’t to provide a ‘handy hints’ guide to practical moral action that would reduce ethics to a set of rules. Rather, Aristotle emphasises the important of the practical wisdom required to apply the doctrine of the mean. Practical wisdom isn’t about applying easy rules, but seeing what to do in a given circumstance, which requires virtues of character (i.e. a virtuous disposition).

The problem with this response is that we might ask: does practical wisdom provide guidance?

</br>

### Explain the objection that Aristotle’s virtue ethics provides no guidance to someone who is not already virtuous and a possible response to it

It is necessary that the virtuous person possesses practical wisdom. If someone does not have practical wisdom, then the doctrine of the mean is no help, as they do not know what the virtuous person would do. Knowledge of the good is therefore out of reach for some.

Aristotle argues that this interpretation is too simple. Knowledge of the good can come in degrees. We may improve our knowledge of the good through changes in our character. Most people will have a sufficient enough understanding to make moral decision. Furthermore, people are able to improve their knowledge of the good by becoming more virtuous people.

#### Revised

If I have practical wisdom, then I know what to do - what if I don’t? Knowing that I should do what a virtuous person would do isn’t helpful if I am not already a virtuous person.

Aristotle’s reply is that the criticism is simplistic - it treats the possession of virtue (of character and practical wisdom) as though it was a binary matter of possessing them or not possessing them. But this is not the case: But this is not the case: possessing virtue is a matter of degree; few are so depraved as to have no concept of the difference between good and bad - most have enough understanding of the good to make moral decisions and seek to develop it further (i.e. acquire greater practical wisdom and virtues of character).

Julia Annas develops this point:

1) We already have some guidance on what is virtuous from the society in which we are raised - a foundation that we can, through experiences, reflect on and develop to become better people;
2) We are all at different stages in this process and have different aims and ideals concerning our lives, which makes a universal set of moral rules that we might apply very difficult to conceive (indeed, undesirable). The fundamental point is that, whatever stage we are at, there is always the question of: ‘what might I do to become ‘more like’ the person I want to be?’. 

In this process, we see the important of role models in virtue ethics: examples of the ‘life well lived’ that we can see to emulate.

</br>

### Explain the criticism that Aristotle’s ethics faces a challenge over conflicts between virtues, and how the challenge might be answered

It is said that Aristotle’s ethics is in a similar position to Kant’s deontology, in being challenged by a conflict of virtue. There seems to be no way to resolve a conflict or to prioritise one virtue over another. Aristotle argues, however, that conflicts between virtues simply don’t take place. He says that with the understanding of virtues which practical wisdom gives, we are able to satisfy the demands of each virtue that is relevant to the situation. This is supported significantly by the fact that Aristotle explicitly rejects the existence of absolute moral rules.

#### Revised

N.B. There is a parallel with conflict of duties in Kant.

Aristotle faces a challenge over the conflict of virtues: can we show justice and mercy? Or do we have to choose one or the other? (e.g. immigration issue: showing mercy to the persecuted/disadvantaged seeking asylum/better prospects and/or justice to existing population/the rule of law )


</br>

### Explain the problem of circularity involved in defining virtuous acts and the virtuous person, and a possible response to it

The problem is caused by two definitions:

1) An act is virtuous if it is an act that would be done by a virtuous person
2) A virtuous person is a person who is disposed to do virtuous acts

These definitions do nothing to define what a virtuous act or a virtuous person is. Each refers back to the other in an endless loop of circularity. In this case, virtue is impossible to define - you can’t define a virtuous act as ‘a virtuous act’!

This problem may be solved if we pay closer attention to Aristotle's definitions. The first definition is certainly true, however the second is more nuanced. Not only is a virtuous person someone who does virtuous acts, but they are also someone who has the virtues that enable them to achieve eudaimonia.  In this case, the definitions are not circular.

</br>

### Explain the objection that Aristotle is wrong to think that a trait must contribute to the individual’s eudaimonia in order to be a virtue

Aristotle draws no distinction between what is morally good and what is good for the self, and there are occasions in which these come into conflict, e.g. sacrificing yourself for the greater good. If this objection is correct, then it leads to a second. Are there virtues that are not in our own self-interest, for example a war medic. They may not flourish individually due to tough circumstances that they work under, but they may save countless lives and relieve great suffering. According to Aristotle, they have not achieved eudaimonia because they have not flourished themselves. But this is surely incorrect. Therefore Aristotle must be wrong to think that a trait must contribute to the individual’s eudaimonia in order to be a virtue.

</br>

### Explain how, according to Annas, Aristotle understands the relationship between the good individual and the moral good

In response to the previous objections, Annas argues that they misunderstand the concept of eudaimonia. We cannot specify what eudaimonia is before considering virtues. Having virtues such as fairness, courage, or generosity isn’t self-centred - you are committing yourself to other’s well being, and this commitment is part of eudaimonia. Eudaimonia involves commitment beyond one’s own values.
