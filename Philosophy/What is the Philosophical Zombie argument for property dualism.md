# What is the Philosophical Zombie argument for property dualism?


</br>

A philosophical zombie is a being that has all the same physical properties as a human, but lacks phenomenal properties.

P1: We can conceive of philosophical zombies - i.e. we can imagine a case where $x$ looks, sounds and behaves like a human but has no inner life.

P2: If they are conceivable, then they are metaphysically possible - we can imagine a world in which philosophical zombies exist, so there is a possible world in which they exist

P3: If they are metaphysically possible, then physicalism is false.

C1: They *are* metaphysically possible, and so physicalism is false - property dualism is true because this argument shows that phenomenal properties are not physical properties (if phenomenal properties could be equated to physical properties, P2 would be no different to humans and so would not exist).

### Chalmers: How arguments for Property Dualism work

Zombie: What is conceivable
Mary: What Mary knows

These are epistemic claims (what can be known)

Zombie: What is metaphysically possible
Mary: What Mary learns

These are ontological claims (what exists)

### Philosophical zombie argument as an argument against:

#### MBTIT

If MBTIT is correct, then philosophical zombies are metaphysically impossible, as it claims that phenomenal properties = physical properties.

#### Functionalism

As with China Brain, a philosophical zombie is a functional duplicate which lacks consciousness, showing that phenomenal properties are more than just functional properties.

#### Hard Behaviourism

Philosophical zombies still demonstrate behaviour/conditions of verification, yet they lack consciousness, which suggests that mind is more than just behaviour.

#### Soft Behaviourism

Ryle argues that consciousness is about paying attention to Red, but philosophical zombies can display and have dispositions to display behaviour without knowing what it is like, so consciousness goes beyond behaviour.
