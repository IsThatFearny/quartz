# What is Phenomenalism? (Revised from Prep)

</br>

### What is the central claim of linguistic phenomenalism?

The central claim is that despite the fact that we talk about mind-independent physical objects as if they *do* exist, we are actually simply referring to patterns of sense-impressions that we experience, or 'phenomena'. Linguistic phenomenalism therefore states that all talk of physical objects can be translated into talk of sense-impressions without losing any meaning whatsoever.

#### Revised

Linguistic Phenomenalism is a theory about what we really mean when we talk about physical objects. Talk of physical objects can be translated into talk of sense-impressions (the qualities of an object as experienced by the senses, without loss of meaning.

</br>

### How is this claim supported by our understanding of how we learn language?

It can be observed that all the vocabulary that we learn as we are growing up is simply a name attributed to a pattern of sense-impressions. A name for a physical object is just shorthand for a description of the sense-impressions that we perceive.

#### Revised

Our vocabulary grows by matching sense-impressions to physical objects - we learn the difference between physical objects with reference to sense-impressions.

### How can the example of fictional film characters help us to understand this?

We attach a name to a fictional film character who may appear on our screen, despite all that connects this name to them being a pattern of colours on our televisions. The character has no existence independently of our perception in this case. This, the phenomenalist argues, is the same principle that applies to everything that we perceive. All objects can be reduced to collections of sense-impressions.

#### Revised

E.g. Buzz lightyear does not have existence independent of the sounds, colours and shapes which appear on the screen. These *are* Buzz Lightyear.

</br>

### How might we 'translate' our usual way of talking about physical objects into the phenomenalist's way of talking about them? And what is the implication of our ability to do so?

The textbook gives the example of translating this expression: 'The melon rolls across the wooden table and knocks over a glass'; into this expression: 'A round yellow patch rotates and moves left across the brown expanse reaching a transparent, hard, container-shaped collection of sense-impressions which turns suddenly downwards'. The implication of this is that it causes belief in the existence of mind-independent physical objects to become redundant. We are able to make do with sense-impressions alone.

#### Revised
Our usual way of talking about physical objects becomes talk about sense-impressions. Talking in this way is complicated and long-winded, so our standard language is a shortcut for this. Our language suggests these objects are mind-independent, but they are actually mind-dependent.

### Translate the words and statements in the activity box into phenomenalist language

'Boiled egg': 'Elliptical, white object, encompassing a yellow, round core'

'Water': ' Transparent fluid'

'Banana': 'Long yellow curve, with thick outer layer which can be opened to reveal edible inner layer'
</br>

### How does phenomenalism deal with the issue of unperceived objects (and thus avoid the issue of 'the god conclusion' in idealism)?

Instead of explaining perception through the independent existence of physical objects (as the realist does), the phenomenalist appeals to the continuing possibilities of experience, which can be triggered by the suitable conditions, i.e. If someone is in the right place at the right time, then they will experience certain sense-impressions. Thus, 'the god conclusion' arrived at by Berkeley is rendered invalid, as he came to that conclusion through arguing that 'nothing can exist unperceived, and therefore everything must be observed by god'

#### Revised

Unperceived objects are continued possibilities of experience, triggered by certain conditions, e.g. If I were in $x$ place, In $y$ conditions, I would experience $z$. Therefore things can exist unperceived, but only as conditional possibilities.
</br>

### How does phenomenalism overcome scepticism?

Phenomenalism closes the gap between our experience and the external world. Instead of stating 'there is a table in this room' and meaning that there is a literal table in the room (this can be doubted) as a realist would, the phenomenalist simply states that 'there is a table in the room', meaning that if they were to stand in this room, they would perceive sense-impressions resembling a table. This is true whether they are dreaming or not.

#### Revised

This overcomes scepticism because 'existence' does not refer to  atter (which we do not directly experience). What exists is the possibility of experience - e.g. 'The table exists' = 'If under $x$ conditions, I would experience the table'
