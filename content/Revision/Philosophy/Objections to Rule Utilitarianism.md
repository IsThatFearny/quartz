Objections to Rule Utilitarianism ^gf4COV1p

We can object that Rule Utilitarianism still fails to understand what is important about partiality. It permits
partiality and encourages it insofar as it contributes to happiness. But the importance of the individual, and
making someone happy purely for their sake still seems to be missing.

We can also object that a rule protecting integrity could prove problematic. If what someone values goes strongly
against promoting the greatest happiness, then morality itself may seem in conflict with their integrity. The Rule
Utilitarian must insist that people's values, and so their integrity, are broadly in line with what the set of rules
that maximise happiness generally require. Morality itself needs to be a part of people's values for Rule Utilitarianism
to respect their integrity. But it could be asked, is this an objection, or a recognition of the demands of morality?
 ^dKatU0ja

Rule Utilitarianism also faces the question of whether pleasure is the only good. Should morality, as a set of rules,
aim to maximise happiness, or are there other important values (e.g. honesty) that matter independently of the
pleasure that they bring?

Rule Utilitarianism must answer the question of whether morality can be summed up by rules. Is life not too
complicated for this? If so, a different theory is needed to provide a course of action when no rules apply.
The Rule Utilitarian answer to this objection is that there is a rule for this scenario: 'when no other rules
apply, do the action that maximises happiness. ^y24VTwLO
