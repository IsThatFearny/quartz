# Metaethics Summary


**Moral Realism:** There are mind-independent moral properties and facts
**Moral Anti-realism:** There is no such thing as mind-independent moral properties and facts

**Cognitivism:** Moral judgements express cognitive beliefs that can be true or false
**Non-cognitivism:** Moral judgements express non-cognitive beliefs which are not capable of being true or false

## Realism
### Naturalism 

- Murder is wrong if the act of murder has the natural property of wrongness. E.g. utilitarianism; good and bad (moral properties) can be reduced to pleasure and pain (natural properties)

**Objections**:

- **Naturalistic Fallacy:** ‘Good’ and ‘pleasure’ cannot be equivocated, as moral and natural properties are entirely different kinds of properties. Even if they often accompany each other and correlate, it does not follow that they are the same. Moral properties cannot be reduced at all.
- **Open question argument:** Asking ‘is pleasure good?’ is a closed question if good and pleasure are the same - ‘is pleasure pleasure?’ - a tautology. **Response:** Examples where things are the same thing but it is an open question as to whether they are, e.g. water and H<sub>2</sub>0.

### Non-Naturalism

- Moral properties exist, and they are non-natural properties (i.e. basic). ‘Murder is wrong’ expresses a cognitive belief that murder is wrong, where wrong refers to a non-natural property
- **Also in favour:** Naturalistic fallacy, open question argument
- **Intuitionism:** Via a faculty of rational intuition, we can directly reflect on the truth of moral judgements. The truth or falsehood of these is said to be self-evident because of this *intuition*. **Response:** Mackie, in arguing from queerness, explicitly rejects as a ‘lame answer’. All intuitionism tells us is that we acquire knowledge of moral judgements in an ‘utterly’ different way to acquiring other knowledge

**Objections:**

- **Queerness:** Non-natural moral properties would be metaphysically and epistemologically queer: metaphysically queer because if they exist then they would need to have ‘to-be-doneness’ built into them, and it is not clear how this is possible - they would have to themselves demand that we act in a certain way; epistemologically queer because it is a mystery how we would acquire knowledge of them - requires spooky hypotheses
- **Verification Principle:** For a statement to be meaningful, it must be both an analytic truth and empirically verifiable. No way to empirically verify the presence of non-natural properties. We could not prove that the act of murder possessed the non-natural property of wrongness.

### Arguments against Moral Realism

- **Relativity:** Variations in cultural and temporal moral values. if moral realism is correct then there is only one objectively correct morality. Why is there disagreement on these issues? All cultures eventually arrive at 1 + 1 = 2, but this convergence does not occur with moral belief. Either one culture has discovered objective morality whilst the other hasn’t; or each culture has developed their own moral standards. The latter is more plausible.
- **Verification principle:** Moral judgements fail the VP. We can empirically verify that murder causes pain, but not that it is wrong. Nor is ‘murder is wrong’ anm
