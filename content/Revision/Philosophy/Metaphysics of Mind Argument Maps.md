[Substance Dualism]
	+ <Indivisibility Argument>: Body is divisible; mind is indivisible. If two things do not sare all properties, then they are not identical. Thus, mind and body are separate substances
		- <Mental is divisible in some sense>: Mind is divisible, e.g. certain mental illnesses cause a split between different parts of the brain
			+ <Descartes' Response>: The way that the two are divisible is different - bodies are functionally divisible, minds are only spatially divisible
		- <Not everything thought of as physical is divisible>: Is what is extended always divisible? We cannot, for example, divide atoms any further. Divisibility may not be an essential property of physical substance
			+ <Possible response>: Even if waves or atoms cannot be divided in reality, we can still conceive of them having half the size. There is no logical limit to how small spatial parts can be
		- <Is the mind a substance?>: The argument assumes that minds are substances. Perhaps, however, there are only mental properties of the brain. These properties in general are not spatially divisible. Descartes must show that this theory is false for his divisibility argument to succeed
	+ <Conceivability Argument>: I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking that that is not extended; I also have a clear and distinct idea of body as something that is extended and does not think. Thus, God can create these things in a way that corresponds to my thought. Mind and body can therefore exist independently of each other, and are separate substances
