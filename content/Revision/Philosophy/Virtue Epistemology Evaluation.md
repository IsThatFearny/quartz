Virtue Epistemology Evaluation ^dcyYUi0D

Does it overcome Gettier cases? ^QDcKVuZo

Virtue Epistemology avoids the gap between truth and the
'third condition' that allows the construction of Gettier
cases. By Zagzebski's definition, the belief must be true,
be formed by acts of intellectual virtue, and its truth must
be the result of such acts. This certainly overcomes the
'Dr Jones and the Virus' counterexample, as Dr Jones'
intellectual virtues did not lead her to the truth about her
patient's conditions.

 ^U8IAkOpJ

Does Virtue Epistemology restrict knowledge to adult humans?
Zagzebski argues that it doesn't, as long as we define virtue
broadly enough to include both intellectually demanding actions,
but also automatic, unconscious ones, and so if we take this
definition to be the correct one, young children at least can have
knowledge as soon as they can tell the difference between truth
and falsehood and are motivated to find the truth.  ^NSoWKdzU

Does it restrict knowledge? ^8v5xEm6e

However, if we take the 'Fake Barn County' counterexample and
apply Virtue Epistemology, confusion arises. Should we 1) argue
that the truth of his belief is not a result of his intellectual
virtue, but of luck; or should we 2) say that his true belief
is the result of his acts of intellectual virtue, since he does
reach the truth that there is a barn? As it stands,
this analysis is too vague. ^xFrCdep9

Suppose someone generally believes whatever they read on the
internet. They don't exercise caution or cross-reference.
Therefore, they are lacking some important intellectual virtues.
If they, as a one off, do fact check some information, and
reach the truth, can we still say that this person has
knowledge? They have performed an act of virtue, but this is
out of character. Should we, therefore, only grant knowledge
to those who have intellectual virtues at least to some
significant degree?

Why does someone's motive make a difference to whether or
not they have knowledge? As long as one discovers the truth
reliably, why should motives matter? Do we need virtues, rather
than reliable processes, in the analysis of knowledge? ^OKFpMaIi

Consistency and Motivation ^qnVhn1GS
