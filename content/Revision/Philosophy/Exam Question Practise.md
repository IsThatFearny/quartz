### Explain the view that the mind is a ‘tabula rasa’ at birth. (5 Marks)

John Locke proposed the idea that the mind is a ‘tabula rasa’ or ‘blank slate’ before experience. He argued that, before experience, our minds contain nothing, and our experience imprints upon the mind. This, he says, is how we gain propositional knowledge, rather than sourcing it from innate ideas. Locke proposes that there are two sources of knowledge: sensation, which is derived from sense experience; and reflection, which is discovered by introspection into ones own mind.

### Explain how an account of epistemic virtue can be used to show why Smith lacks knowledge in one of Gettier’s original counter-examples. (12 Marks)

Gettier’s counter-example of Smith and Jones is as follows: Smith and Jones both apply for a job. Smith is told by the boss that Jones will get the job, and forms the proposition that ‘the man with ten coins in his pocket (Jones) will get the job’. However, Smith ends up getting the job. Unbeknownst to him, he has ten coins in his pocket. So, whilst the intention behind his original proposition is mistaken, under the tripartite view’s requirements for knowledge (justified true belief) Smith would still have knowledge. However, this is a complete coincidence, and so we must find an alternative account to avoid coincidental knowledge.

An account of epistemic virtue can be used to show why Smith lacks knowledge. Virtue epistemology claims that for knowledge to be present, a belief must be accurate (i.e. be true),adroit (formed from the use of epistemic virtue. Epistemic virtue involves the use of such faculties as memory, perception, and the like), and adroit (accurate due to the use of epistemic virtue). We can apply this to Gettier’s original counter example by querying each of these conditions. Firstly, Smith’s belief is accurate - the man with ten coins in his pocket did indeed get the job. Is it apt? Yes, because Smith has used logic and perception to form the proposition. However, Smith’s belief is not adroit, because its accuracy does not depend upon the use of epistemic virtue, but instead on coincidence. Therefore, it can be argued that Smith does not have knowledge, and thus all coincidental beliefs are not knowledge. Gettier’s counter-example is defeated.

### Explain the reliabilist definition of knowledge. (5 Marks)

The reliabilist claims that knowledge can be defined as a true belief formed through a reliable cognitive process. A reliable cognitive process is that which produces a high percentage of true beliefs, e.g. vision, touch, etc. This definition of knowledge strengthens the justification condition, but does not go so far as to make it infallible.

### Explain Nozick’s experience machine objection, and a possible response to it. (12 Marks)

Nozick’s experience machine is an objection raised to Act Utilitarianism. The argument that it proposes a hypothetical machine which, upon entry, would allow the user to experience a perfect life which would maximise their happiness to the greatest extent. The user would not be able to distinguish between reality and this virtual reality, and would therefore believe that the simulation is, in fact, their real life. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate that, even if offered the chance of a perfect life in a simulation, we would not take that opportunity, because most people would prefer to live a life in contact with reality, even if that means sacrificing happiness. Under Act Utilitarianism, everyone would be forced into the experience machine in order to maximise happiness. But this seems morally wrong, as we would be going against the preference to remain in contact with reality. This, Nozick argues, means that there is a significant problem with Act Utilitarianism, namely that it does not take into account preference.

The response to Nozick’s experience machine is that of Preference Utilitarianism. Preference Utilitarianism proposes that we should take into account people’s preferences when making decisions and choosing how to act, even if said decisions would not maximise happiness. So, if when faced with the choice between the experience machine and real life, someone’s preference is to remain in touch with reality, the morally correct action is to allow them to remain in touch with reality. This can also be applied to the wishes of the dead. If a dead person’s will is that their money be donated to a charity, then the morally correct action is for this wish to be respected, even though the action that would maximise the greatest happiness may be to spend the money in another way. This means that there is a way that Utilitarianism can take preference into account and prevent us being forced into actions that are morally wrong.
