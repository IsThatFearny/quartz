However, there are two objections to this response. Firstly, it no longer holds true that we cannot often benefit
people in general. We can donate to charities, and we are continually aware of many different causes of suffering
around the world. It is therefore perfectly possible to devote much of one's time and resources to helping others
in general. The second objection is that Mill's response doesn't address the objection that Utilitarianism fails to
understand the moral importance of partiality. If the general happiness is the ultimate end, then we should think of
friendships as a way to maximise the general happiness. But this doesn't seem right. Friendship requires that the
friend is valued as the individual person that they are, and that we act out of love for them. The partiality that
we show towards our friends seems to rule out a Utilitarian understanding of morality. Doing something for a friend
is morally good. ^RZVPt824

Issues for Act Utilitarianism - Partiality Continued ^oPCp37kV

Some Utilitarians have argued that morality does requires us to be impartial, and so it is much more demanding than
we would like to think. However, Mill's discussion of justice allows for partiality, and therefore he can object that
we are still considering Utilitarianism in the wrong way. People have learnt that having partial relationships is central
to happiness, and so it does not maximise happiness to give these up in favour of promoting the general happiness.

We may here repeat the objection that Mill is giving up on Act Utilitarianism, and is instead appealing to general rules. ^y9MvHeT1
