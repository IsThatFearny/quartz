> Explain Utilitarian Moral Naturalism and the naturalistic fallacy as a criticism of it

Moral Naturalism is a realist theory which claims that there are objective moral facts (hence ‘realist’) and that moral properties can be reduced to natural properties. Utilitarianism is an example of a naturalist theory - both Mill and Bentham reduce the moral properties of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ to the respective natural properties of pleasure and pain. However, in arguing from an opposite standpoint of moral non-naturalism, Moore puts forward a major criticism of moral naturalism.

Moore posits the ‘naturalistic fallacy’. He argues that moral naturalism equivocates moral and natural properties, and treats them as if they were the same property, which allows moral properties to be reduced to natural properties. However, he says, moral and natural properties are entirely different kinds of properties. In Mill’s proof of Utilitarianism, he equates goodness with the natural property of pleasure - Moore argues that this is flawed reasoning. Just because the two might often correlate (e.g. good and pleasure often come together) does not mean that these properties are the same thing. Therefore, Moore argues that moral properties cannot be reduced to natural properties, and goes so far as to argue that moral properties cannot be reduced to all, because they are basic.

> Explain the open question argument and one response to it

The open question argument is Moore’s response, from a Moral non-naturalist standpoint, to moral naturalism. He argues that asking whether pleasure and good are the same thing is an ‘open question’. If pleasure and goodness were the same thing, Moore says, then the question would be closed (i.e. ‘is pleasure pleasure’ or ‘is good good?’). Asking these questions makes no sense - it is tautological, and Moore uses this as an argument to bring down moral naturalism, as he argues that a tautological closed question in this way cannot be compatible with morality.

One response to the open question argument is that there are many examples where there are two things that are quite clearly the same thing, but it remains an open question as to whether they are. Take, for example, water and H<sub>2</sub>0. These are two separate concepts, but we know scientifically that they refer to the same thing. Is it, then, a closed question to ask ‘is water H<sub>2</sub>0?’? Is it the same as asking ‘is water water?’ or similar? We can argue that it is not. Therefore, this allows them possibility that asking ‘is pleasure good?’ is a circumstance similar to this, and therefore moral non-naturalism does not lead to tautology.

> [!question]
> Explain intuitionism and one objection to it

Intuitionism is Moore’s argument for how, under moral non-naturalism, we can acquire moral knowledge. Moral naturalism can easily make a natural connection between an action and its badness/goodness: there is nothing spooky or un-natural about saying that ‘torturing people causes pain’, and it naturally follows that ‘torturing people is bad’, because ‘bad’ and ‘pain are equivocated’. But moral non-naturalism cannot make this natural link, as by its very nature it argues for non-natural properties, which are not like normal physical properties which can be perceived and measured. Moore accounts for this by arguing for intuitionism. He says that, via a faculty of rational intuition, we can directly reflect on the truth of moral judgements. The truth or falsehood of such judgements is self-evident because of this.

However, we can object to intuitionism using Mackie’s argument from queerness. Mackie argues that Moore’s intuitionism is a ‘lame answer’ to the question of how we acquire knowledge of moral properties because it does not really explain anything. To say that we acquire knowledge of moral properties through intuitionism is just to say that there is something ‘utterly different’ in this when compared to our ways of acquiring normal propositional knowledge.
