> Explain Utilitarian Moral Naturalism and the naturalistic fallacy as a criticism of it

Moral Naturalism is a realist theory which claims that there are objective moral facts (hence ‘realist’) and that moral properties can be reduced to natural properties. Utilitarianism is an example of a naturalist theory - both Mill and Bentham reduce the moral properties of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ to the respective natural properties of pleasure and pain. However, in arguing from an opposite standpoint of moral non-naturalism, Moore puts forward a major criticism of moral naturalism.

Moore posits the ‘naturalistic fallacy’. He argues that moral naturalism equivocates moral and natural properties, and treats them as if they were the same property, which allows moral properties to be reduced to natural properties. However, he says, moral and natural properties are entirely different kinds of properties. In Mill’s proof of Utilitarianism, he equates goodness with the natural property of pleasure - Moore argues that this is flawed reasoning. Just because the two might often correlate (e.g. good and pleasure often come together) does not mean that these properties are the same thing. Therefore, Moore argues that moral properties cannot be reduced to natural properties, and goes so far as to argue that moral properties cannot be reduced to all, because they are basic.

The open question argument is Moore’s response, from a Moral non-naturalist standpoint, to moral naturalism. He argues that asking whether pleasure and good are the same thing is an ‘open question’. If pleasure and goodn
