# Characterisations of Arguments (Metaphysics of God)

## Ontological Arguments

**Anselm:** God is a being greater than which cannot be conceived. We can conceive of such a being. It is greater to exist in the mind than in reality. Therefore, God exists.
$\quad$**Objections:** Gaunilo’s Island - by 

**Descartes:** God is a supremely perfect being. We can conceive of such a being. Existence is a perfection, because if God is omnipotent then He must have been able come into existence from nothing. Therefore, God exists.

**Malcolm:** God is a being greater than which cannot be conceived. Such a being cannot come into or go out of existence. ∴ if God exists, He cannot go out of existence, ∴ His existence is necessary. If God does not exist, then he cannot begin to exist - if he does not exist, then his existence is impossible. Either God’s existence is necessary (if He exists), or impossible (if He doesn’t exist). His existence is only impossible if the concept of God is incoherent, which it is not, and therefore His existence is not impossible. ∴ God’s existence is necessary.

## Teleological Arguments

**Paley:** If we look at a watch and the complexity of its design (i.e. organisation of parts for a purpose) then we can infer that it has been designed. Likewise, the spatial order in the universe and its vast complexity causes us to infer that it too has been designed. This order is *so* complex that Paley concludes the only possible designer is God.

**Swinburne:** There are two types of explanation: personal and scientific. A personal explanation is one such as ‘the universe was created by God’. Scientific explanation cannot explain the laws of nature (i.e. temporal order); it can only explain their effects. ∴ the only remaining explanation is personal, i.e. ‘The universe was designed by God’. Therefore, God is the designer, and this entails his existence.

**Hume:** the organisation of parts for a purpose in nature (e.g. the complex structure of an eye) correlates with the complex nature of human design (e.g. the workings of a watch). Similar effects have similar causes. The cause of human designs are minds, and so the cause of natural design must also be a mind. Given the complexity of the universe, this mind is God.

## Cosmological Arguments

**Kalam:** Whatever begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist, and thus has a cause. This cause is God.

**Aquinas’ First Way (from motion):** Some things in the world are in motion, and these must have been put in motion by something else. If $A$ was moved by $B$, then $C$ must have put $B$ in motion, and so on into infinity. If this chain is infinite, then there cannot have been a first mover. If there was no first mover, then nothing could move. Things move, and so there must be a first move. This first mover is God.

**Aquinas’ Second Way (from causation):** Everything in the universe is subject to cause and effect. $A$ is caused by $B$, which is caused by $C$, ad infinitum. If this chain of causation was infinite then there would have been no first cause, but if this were the case then there would be no subsequent causes or effects. There *are* subsequent causes and effects, and so there must have been a first cause. This first cause is God.

**Descartes:** If I were the cause of my own existence then I would have given myself all perfections. I do not have all perfections and so am not the cause of my own existence. I am a thinking thing that has the idea of God, and because the cause of an effect must have the same reality as the effect, whatever caused me must also be a thinking thing with the idea of God. Whatever caused me must have either been caused by something else, or be the cause of its own existence. If my existence was caused by something else, then that cause would have to either have caused its own existence or be caused by something else. There cannot be an infinite regress of causation, and so there must be something that caused its own existence. This is God.

**Aquinas’ Third Way (from contingency):** Everything that exists contingently did not exist at some point. If everything exists contingently, then at some point, nothing existed. If nothing existed, then nothing could begin to exist. Things *did* begin to exist, and therefore there was never nothing in existence. ∴ there must be something that exists necessarily, rather than contingently. This necessary being is God.

**Leibniz:** Based on the ‘principle of sufficient reason’: every true fact has a reason for its truth. The sufficient reason for necessary truths is revealed by analysis. We cannot, however, provide sufficient reason for contingent truths without referring to other contingent truths, which also need a sufficient reason. ∴ in order to find a sufficient reason for the truth of contingent truths, we must appeal to a necessary substance: God.
