# Characterisations of Arguments (Metaphysics of God)

## Ontological Arguments

**Anselm:** God is a being greater than which cannot be conceived. We can conceive of such a being. It is greater to exist in the mind than in reality. Therefore, God exists.

**Descartes:** God is a supremely perfect being. We can conceive of such a being. Existence is a perfection, because if God is omnipotent then He must have been able come into existence from nothing. Therefore, God exists.

**Malcolm:** God is a being greater than which cannot be conceived. Such a being cannot come into or go out of existence. ∴ if God exists, He cannot go out of existence, ∴ His existence is necessary. If God does not exist, then he cannot begin to exist - if he does not exist, then his existence is impossible. Either God’s existence is necessary (if He exists), or impossible (if He doesn’t exist). His existence is only impossible if the concept of God is incoherent, which it is not, and therefore His existence is not impossible. ∴ God’s existence is necessary.

## Teleological Arguments

**Paley:** If we look at a watch and the complexity of its design (i.e. organisation of parts for a purpose) then we can infer that it has been designed. Likewise, the spatial order in the universe and its vast complexity causes us to infer that it too has been designed. This order is *so* complex that Paley concludes the only possible designer is God.

**Swinburne:** There are two types of explanation: personal and scientific. A personal explanation is one such as ‘the universe was created by God’. Scientific explanation cannot explain the laws of nature (i.e. temporal order); it can only explain their effects. ∴ the only remaining explanation is personal, i.e. ‘The universe was designed by God’. Therefore, God is the designer, and this entails his existence.

**Hume:** the organisation of parts for a purpose in nature (e.g. the complex structure of an eye) correlates with the complex nature of h
