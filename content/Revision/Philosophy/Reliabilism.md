# Text Elements
Reliabilism ^8OnovGqe

1. p is true,
2. you believe that p, and
3. your belief is produced by a 
   reliable cognitive process.
 ^SxRl2cgG

A reliable cognitive process
is one which produces a high
percentage of true beliefs ^hXPDWaqY

Children and Animals can have knowledge ^rP1Z5hvu

One advantage of Reliabilism is that it allows children
and animals to possess knowledge, because their true
beliefs are caused by reliable processes - justification
is irrelevant ^ZoFQctk7

Knowledge as a 'natural good' ^DhFx7VAp

Zagzebski notes that Reliabilism understands knowledge as a
'natural good'. It isn't something that is praiseworthy, but it
is definitely something that is desirable. Having reliably true
beliefs confers a significant benefit on a creature. ^7fT9ZVXn

Does Reliabilism overcome Gettier cases? ^CJyFSMqn

No. Take the example of Fake Barn County, in which someone
is driving through an area in which there are lots of fake barns,
but doesn't know it. They believe the barns to be real. This belief
is, of course, not knowledge, because it are false. However, just once,
this person looks at a barn, believing it to be a real barn, and it is, in
fact, the only real barn in the area. Reliabilism has to say that the
person knows that there is a barn. However, the belief still seems to
have arisen through coincidence or by accident. ^HgiMvQvu
