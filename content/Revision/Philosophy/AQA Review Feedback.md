# AQA Review Feedback

</br>

### 5 Markers

- Give examples - easy win!
- Give simple statement and then elaborate - draw out different parts for extra marks
- Do not elaborate into redundancy

</br>

### 12 Markers

- Link by showing understanding of how the second part responds to a part of the first part

</br>

### 25 Markers

- Can’t evaluate if it is not explained!!
- Weighting cannot be undervalued - ‘this argument is much harder to respond to’, etc.
- Introduction - not just *what* you are going to argue (e.g. ‘this essay will argue that Malcom’s ontological argument fails’), but *why* you are going to argue this (e.g. ‘this essay will argue that Malcom’s ontological argument fails *because*…)

A good 3-5-5-12 will help greatly with marks - you can afford more marks dropped in 25 marks.
