# All Arguments and Objections (Metaphysics of God)

## Ontological Arguments
 
**Anselm:** God is a being greater than which cannot be conceived. We can conceive of such a being. It is greater to exist in the mind than in reality. Therefore, God exists.
**Objections:** *Gaunilo’s Island* - by Anselm’s logic, we could conceive of a perfect *anything*, and thus
conceive it into existence; *Hume - God does not exist is not a contradiction*, because is it conceivable that God does not exist. ‘God exists’ is not an analytic truth; *Kant - Existence is not a predicate*. To say ‘God exists’ is not to say anything about God. Adding existence to God tells us nothing about God.

**Descartes:** God is a supremely perfect being. We can conceive of such a being. Existence is a perfection, because if God is omnipotent then He must have been able come into existence from nothing. Therefore, God exists.
**Objections:** As above

**Malcolm:** God is a being greater than which cannot be conceived. Such a being cannot come into or go out of existence. ∴ if God exists, He cannot go out of existence, ∴ His existence is necessary. If God does not exist, then he cannot begin to exist - if he does not exist, then his existence is impossible. Either God’s existence is necessary (if He exists), or impossible (if He doesn’t exist). His existence is only impossible if the concept of God is incoherent, which it is not, and therefore His existence is not impossible. ∴ God’s existence is necessary. 
**Objections:** *The concept of God is self contradictory* - see paradox of the stone, euthyphro dilemma, etc; *commits the fallacy of equivocation* by equating necessary existence and necessary truth. God may have the property of necessary existence (if he exists), but this is not the same as saying that God actually exists necessarily.

## Teleological Arguments

**Paley:** If we look at a watch and the complexity of its design (i.e. organisation of parts for a purpose) then we can infer that it has been designed. Likewise, the spatial order in the universe and its vast complexity causes us to infer that it too has been designed. This order is *so* complex that Paley concludes the only possible designer is God.
**Objections:** *Problem of spatial disorder* - the universe contains a large amount of spatial disorder, areas where there is no ‘organisation of parts for a purpose’; *evolution by natural selection* - design may be a result of evolution, which 

**Hume:** the organisation of parts for a purpose in nature (e.g. the complex structure of an eye) correlates with the complex nature of human design (e.g. the workings of a watch). Similar effects have similar causes. The cause of human designs are minds, and so the cause of natural design must also be a mind. Given the complexity of the universe, this mind is God.
**Objections:** *Problems with analogy arguments* - man-made objects are very different from man-made objects, ‘great disproportion’ between *part* of the universe and the universe as a whole undermines the inference that something similar to human intelligence caused the universe, no good reason to choose design by intelligent mind as a cause; *designer may not be the only/best explanation* - we have to rule out other possible explanations of the order of parts for a purpose, e.g. matter is finite and time is infinite, so all possible combinations of matter will occur; *unique case* - origin of the universe is unique. To make any inference about this origin, we would need to have knowledge of other possible worlds, but we do not have this knowledge

**Swinburne:** There are two types of explanation: personal and scientific. A personal explanation is one such as ‘the universe was created by God’. Scientific explanation cannot explain the laws of nature (i.e. temporal order); it can only explain their effects. ∴ the only remaining explanation is personal, i.e. ‘The universe was designed by God’. Therefore, God is the designer, and this entails his existence.

## Cosmological Arguments

**Kalam:** Whatever begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist, and thus has a cause. This cause is God.

**Aquinas’ First Way (from motion):** Some things in the world are in motion, and these must have been put in motion by something else. If $A$ was moved by $B$, then $C$ must have put $B$ in motion, and so on into infinity. If this chain is infinite, then there cannot have been a first mover. If there was no first mover, then nothing could move. Things move, and so there must be a first move. This first mover is God.

**Aquinas’ Second Way (from causation):** Everything in the universe is subject to cause and effect. $A$ is caused by $B$, which is caused by $C$, ad infinitum. If this chain of causation was infinite then there would have been no first cause, but if this were the case then there would be no subsequent causes or effects. There *are* subsequent causes and effects, and so there must have been a first cause. This first cause is God.

**Descartes:** If I were the cause of my own existence then I would have given myself all perfections. I do not have all perfections and so am not the cause of my own existence. I am a thinking thing that has the idea of God, and because the cause of an effect must have the same reality as the effect, whatever caused me must also be a thinking thing with the idea of God. Whatever caused me must have either been caused by something else, or be the cause of its own existence. If my existence was caused by something else, then that cause would have to either have caused its own existence or be caused by something else. There cannot be an infinite regress of causation, and so there must be something that caused its own existence. This is God.

**Aquinas’ Third Way (from contingency):** Everything that exists contingently did not exist at some point. If everything exists contingently, then at some point, nothing existed. If nothing existed, then nothing could begin to exist. Things *did* begin to exist, and therefore there was never nothing in existence. ∴ there must be something that exists necessarily, rather than contingently. This necessary being is God.

**Leibniz:** Based on the ‘principle of sufficient reason’: every true fact has a reason for its truth. The sufficient reason for necessary truths is revealed by analysis. We cannot, however, provide sufficient reason for contingent truths without referring to other contingent truths, which also need a sufficient reason. ∴ in order to find a sufficient reason for the truth of contingent truths, we must appeal to a necessary substance: God.
