# Innatism Summary

</br>

## Arguments for innatism
### Plato’s Argument

- Plato’s example of innate propositional knowledge is that of ‘Meno’s slave’. In this example, Socrates asks an uneducated slave boy a range of maths and geometry questions, all of which the boy is able to answer without prior experience
- Plato argues that this is *innate knowledge*
- He says that this knowledge is possible without prior experience, and simply must be ‘unlocked’ through prompting (in this case, Socrates questioning).
- Carruthers expands upon the idea of 'prompting' or a ‘trigger’. He argues that knowledge can be triggered by experience, e.g. baby birds only need a small part of a song to be able to sing the whole thing; or children start to think in particular ways at a certain stage in their development, when their experiences ‘unlock’ innate knowledge

### Liebniz’s argument

- Liebniz argues that necessary truths cannot be derived from our experience, since experience can only teach us how things at a given moment, and cannot tell us about how things must be
- Thus, we should regard a priori knowledge of necessary truths as innate
- Leibniz’s argument is that we can discover these truths by ‘attending carefully and methodically to what is already in our minds’.
- Innate knowledge, he says, is foundational knowledge, which can be built upon by sense experience. Sense experience is the key that helps us to make sense of our innate knowledge

## Locke’s argument against Innatism

- Locke’s argument against innatism is as follows:

	P1: If there is innate knowledge, it is universal
	P2: If an idea is part of the mind, then the mind must be conscious of it
	C1: Innate knowledge is therefore knowledge that every human being is or has been conscious of
	P3: Children and idiots do not know theorems in geometry or mathematics, nor do they understand the claim ‘it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be’. They cannot understand these claims
	C2: These claims are not universal, and so are not innate
	P4: Further, there are *no* claims that are universally accepted, including by children and idiots
	C3: Therefore, there is no innate knowledge

</br>

### Liebniz’s response

- Leibniz’s response to Locke is that he has not understood the sense in which knowledge can be innate
- Locke is wrong to claim that an idea can only be in the mind if we are conscious of it
- Leibniz says that innate knowledge exists as a disposition or an attitude towards developing, understanding and knowing certain thoughts

## Are there innate concepts?

- We cannot have propositional knowledge without knowledge of concepts. Thus, if there is propositional innate knowledge, there must be innate concepts too.
- Locke raises three objections to innate concepts:
	 1) Newborn babies have no concepts beyond their experiences in the womb
	 2) God is not an innate concept
	 3) Concepts can only be unconscious if they are lodged in our memory
- Liebniz responds to these as such:
	1) We have a disposition to form concepts such as identity at birth - it takes time for them to be fully and explicitly formed in our minds
	2) Language and concepts are not the same, not having the language to talk about God is not the same as not having the concept of a higher being
	3) Innate concepts are not new or remembered - they are dispositions, which we may not always be conscious of (‘triggering’)
</br>

### Tabula Rasa

- Locke argues that rather than experience triggering innate concepts, our minds are *tabula rasa* at birth
- This means that our experiences imprint knowledge on us over time
- Locke proposes that there are two sources of our ideas: sensation, which is experience as perceived by the senses; and reflection, which is defined as internal operations of the mind, or introspection
