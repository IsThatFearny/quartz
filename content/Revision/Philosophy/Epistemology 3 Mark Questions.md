# Epistemology 3 Mark Questions

</br>

## What is Knowledge?

</br>

### What is *a priori* knowledge?

A priori knowledge is knowledge that can be known before we have experience of it. This knowledge is analytic, i.e. true by definition and in all possible worlds. For example, our knowledge that 2 + 2 = 4 is a priori because we can know it before we have experience of mathematics.

</br>

### What is the Tripartite View of propositional knowledge?

The tripartite view of knowledge is that it can be defined as being a true, justified belief, i.e. some proposition $p$ is true, one believes that $p$, and one’s belief that $p$ is justified in some way or another.

</br>

### What is the No False Lemmas definition of knowledge?

The No False Lemmas definition of knowledge states that knowledge can be defined as follows: some proposition $p$ is true, one believes that $p$, and one’s belief that $p$ is not inferred from any other claim (i.e. a false lemma). This is an attempt to strengthen the justification condition by preventing a belief from arising from a false claim.

</br>

### What is acquaintance knowledge?

Acquaintance knowledge is ‘knowledge of’. It is knowledge that we gain from experience about things such as places or people. A good example of acquaintance knowledge is my knowledge of Oxford, or my knowledge about my best friend.

</br>

### What is ability knowledge?

Ability knowledge is ‘knowledge how’, for example, how to ride a bike or how to swim. It is subconscious and difficult to articulate. It is generally gained through experience and practise.

</br>

### What is an analytic truth?

An analytic truth is a truth that is true by definition, and in all possible worlds. It is a priori knowledge. Examples include mathematics (e.g. 2 + 2 = 4), and tautologies.

</br>

### What is Reliabilism?

Reliabilism is the claim that we can define knowledge as follows: some claim, $p$, is true; one believes that $p$; one’s belief that $p$ is caused by a reliable cognitive process. A reliable cognitive process is one that tends to produce a high proportion of true beliefs, such as vision or memory.
</br>

### What is Virtue Epistemology?

Virtue Epistemology takes two forms. The first is Zagzebski’s claim that knowledge can be defined as: one believes some claim, $p$; and one’s belief that $p$ arises from an act of intellectual virtue (an intellectual virtue being a virtue that is motivated to find truth and succeeds in doing so). The second is Sosa’s ‘Triple A’ definition, which claims that knowledge must be Accurate (true), Adroit (the agent must be intellectually virtuous), and Apt (the truth of the claim arises as a result of the virtue of the agent).

</br>

### What is Infallibilism?

Infallibilism is the view that our justification for knowledge must be infallible. The argument for it proceeds as follows: P1. No one can know what is false; C2. If I know some claim $p$, I am not mistaken about $p$; C2. Therefore, justification must guarantee truth; C3. If I know that $p$, I cannot possibly be mistaken; C4. Therefore, if it is possible that I am mistaken, I cannot know $p$; C5. Therefore, Infallibilism is correct.

</br>

### What is the difference between a necessary truth and a contingent truth?

A necessary truth is one that must be present for something to fit the definition. They are, by definition, true, and true in all possible worlds. Contingent truths, by contrast, depend on how the world is for their truth or falsehood. It is therefore not necessarily true in all possible worlds.

</br>

### What is the difference between a priori knowledge and a posteriori knowledge?

A priori knowledge is knowledge that we can possess before experience, e.g. mathematical truths such as 2 + 2 = 4. By contrast, A Posteriori knowledge can only be gained from experience, e.g. our knowledge of sensation.


</br>

## Perception

</br>

### What is Direct Realism?

Direct Realism is the claim that we perceive the external world, and the mind-independent physical objects of which it consists, directly. In other words, we perceive the world exactly as it is in reality. If I see a brown table, then that table is really there and looks exactly as I see it.
</br>

### What is Indirect Realism?

Indirect Realism is the claim that our perception is indirect, and that we perceive the external world through sense-data. Sense-data is what makes up our perception, and is unique and private to the individual. Indirect Realism also utilises the concept of primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are those which are unchanging no matter what changes in our perception, such as shape (i.e. molecular structure). Secondary qualities are those which change depending on circumstances, such as temperature, colour, smell, etc. Indirect realism argues that secondary qualities are what makes up our variable sense-data, whereas primary qualities are fixed. 
</br>

### What is idealism?

Idealism is the claim that all of our perception is entirely mind-dependent, and that the sole cause of our perception is God. It attacks the primary/secondary quality distinction, instead arguing that primary qualities such as shape are also mind-dependent, similarly to secondary qualities. Idealism also argues that there may be no external world consisting of mind-independent physical objects, as all of our perceptions are mind-dependent.

</br>

## Rational Intuition and Deduction

### What is Empiricism?

Empiricism is the claim that all of our knowledge is a posteriori, derived from empirical experience. This is in opposition to rationalism.

</br>

## Limits of Knowledge

### What is Philosophical Scepticism?

Philosophical scepticism, also known as global scepticism, is the view that we must doubt all of our knowledge and our sense-experience, because it is possible that we are being deceived by an evil demon who makes us believe things that are not so.

</br>

### What is solipsism?


Solipsism is the view that one is the only mind that exists in the world, and that we cannot prove that other people/minds exist. It arises from and is a form of scepticism.
