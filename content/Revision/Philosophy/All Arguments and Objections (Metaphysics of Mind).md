# All Arguments and Objections (Metaphysics of Mind)

## Substance Dualism

**Indivisibility argument:** The body is divisible, but the mind is not divisible. Because the two do not have the same properties, they cannot be identical (i.e. Leibniz’s law).
**Objections:** *mental is divisible in some sense* - some mental illnesses can divide the mind, e.g. multiple personality syndrome; *not everything that is physical is divisible* - once we get to a certain point (i.e. an atomic level), we can no longer divide the physical. We can’t divide waves or force fields; *is the mind a substance?* - minds might not be ‘things’. If this is so, then they cannot have the property of divisibility as they do not exist. Instead, there are only mental properties
