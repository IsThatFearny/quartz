# All Arguments and Objections (Metaphysics of Mind)

</br>

## Substance Dualism

**Indivisibility argument:** The body is divisible, but the mind is not divisible. Because the two do not have the same properties, they cannot be identical (i.e. Leibniz’s law).
**Objections:** *mental is divisible in some sense* - some mental illnesses can divide the mind, e.g. multiple personality syndrome; *not everything that is physical is divisible* - once we get to a certain point (i.e. an atomic level), we can no longer divide the physical. We can’t divide waves or force fields; *is the mind a substance?* - minds might not be ‘things’. If this is so, then they cannot have the property of divisibility as they do not exist. Instead, there are only mental properties.

**Conceivability argument:** I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking thing that is not extended; I also have a clear and distinct idea of body as something that is extended and non-thinking. Thus, God can create these things in a way that corresponds to my thought. Mind and body can therefore exist independently of each other, and are thus separate substances.
**Objections:** *mind without body is not conceivable* - we do not know the nature of thinking and introspection, and thus we cannot be sure of Descartes’ claim that mind cannot exist without body, purely through introspection; *what is conceivable may not be metaphysically possible* - Masked man fallacy: I believe that the masked man has robbed a bank, and I believe that my father has *not* robbed the bank. Thus, I conceive that the masked man is not my father; this is a logical impossibility. It is also metaphysically impossible that my father is the masked man, because one person cannot be someone else. Applying this to Descartes’ argument, we can argue that the mind may not be an ontologically dependent substance, and it would therefore be metaphysically impossible for it to exist separately from the body; *what is metaphysically possible tells us nothing about the actual world* - just because something is possible, does not mean that it is true in the actual world - it merely *could* be true

**Objections to *interactionist* substance dualism:**

**Conceptual interaction problem:** The movement of a physical object is only initiated by some physical force. If dualism is true, then the mind is not in space and thus cannot exert any physical force. Therefore, if dualism is true, then the mind cannot cause any physical object to move. Either dualism is false, or the mind cannot cause any part of the body to move. The mind can cause the body to move, and so dualism is false.

**Empirical interaction problem:** If the mind, as a non-physical substance, moved the body, then the total amount of energy in the universe would increase. If the total amount of energy in the universe increased, then the law of conservation of energy would not apply to the universe, and the universe is not a closed system. Therefore, physics cannot give us the correct account of the universe. Further, current science indicates that movements of the body are caused by physical events in the brain. So, if the mind moves the body, it does so by changing what happens in the brain, and we have no evidence of this occurring.

**Objections to *epiphenomenalist* substance dualism:** 

**Problem of other minds:** We can experience our own minds directly, but we cannot experience other people’s mental states - all we have to go on is their behaviour. If bodies are entirely independent from minds, then how can we infer from seeing a body that there is a mind attached?
**Objections:** *Argument from analogy* - I have a mind, and know from experience that my mental states cause my behaviour. Other people have similar bodies and behave in similar ways to me. By analogy, therefore, their behaviour has the same type of cause as my behaviour, i.e. mental states. Therefore, other people have minds; *existence of other minds is the best hypothesis* - the best explanation of the behaviour of other people is that they have similar mental states to me.

**Category mistake:** Substance dualism makes the mistake of thinking that the mind is like the body - i.e. another ‘thing’. It is a mistake to think that physical and mental concepts operate in the same way. To ‘have’ a mind is not be in possession of a ‘thing’.

## MBTIT

**Issues for MBTIT:**

**Multiple realisability:** Take pain, for example. Many different neurophysiological states could realise pain, and so pain cannot be the same thing as any one of those properties. Dog’s brains might process pain in a different way to how humans process it. This objections strengthens further if we apply to possible extra-terrestrial beings, who have followed an entirely different evolutionary process to us. The theory makes a very implausible claim.

**Indivisibility argument:** As above

**Conceivability argument:** It is conceivable that, for any type of mental state, someone has a mental state without having the brain state with which MBTIT claims it is identical. What is conceivable is metaphysically possible. Therefore, it is metaphysically possible that for any type of mental state, it can exist in the absence of the brain state with which MBTIT claims it is identical. If this is the case, then the two are not the same thing.

## Eliminative Materialism

**Issues for EM:**

**Certainty about the existence of mental states:** EM is counter-intuitive. What could be more certain than that we have thoughts, desires, etc? No argument could be strong enough to give up such a belief. 

**Folk Psych. has good predictive and explanatory power:** Folk Psych. is not intended to be a theory which explains things such as mental illness, sleep, learning, etc, and so its failure in this is not a criticism
