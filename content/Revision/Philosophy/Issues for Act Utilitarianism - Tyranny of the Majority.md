Issues for Act Utilitarianism - Tyranny of the Majority ^EmYEw6cn

Utilitarianism says that we should do whatever brings about the greatest happiness, i.e. the happiness
of the majority. However, we can question whether there should be constraints on this majority power,
e.g. should people have certain rights that allow them freedom of movement, expression, etc, or is it
morally permissible to remove these rights if it would bring about the greatest happiness?

Mill notes two ways in which the majority can exercise their power. The first is democracy. A democratic
government could pass a law which prevents the practise of a certain religion, if that is what the
majority of people in society wanted. Mill argues that the powers of a democratic government need
to be limited by respect for individual rights and liberties, but we might argue that Utilitarianism has no
place for such concepts. ^cbWmlKUO

Mill is also concerned about tyranny of social opinion, i.e. societal norms. When disapproval of alternative
practises is socially expressed and publicly endorsed, it can affect how people think and what they do;
they are not free to live as they please, even if there is no law against it. Utilitarianism could not
condemn such a practise (assuming that it creates the greatest happiness)? ^QnjOnfpF
