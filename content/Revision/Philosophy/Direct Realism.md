Direct Realism ^nBVDXLK5

Direct Realism is the claim that what we perceive through our senses are just these very things,
together with various properties. When I perceive a table, for example, I perceive its size, shape,
colour, etc. Direct Realism claims that what we perceive are mind-independent physical objects and
their properties. Another way of putting this is to say that the 'immediate object' of perception is
the physical object itself. Direct realists argue that we can gain knowledge through perception
because perception is a form of 'openness' to the world. Our awareness of mind-independent objects
is sensitive to how the objects are - differences in their properties will be detected by differences
in our perceptual experience of them.
