Utilitarianism Part 2 ^r209awFJ

Mill's Qualitative Utilitarianism ^vdpVd8iW

Mill's definition of happiness is more complex
than Bentham's. He argues that happiness is
mements of highly pleasurable excitement in
an existence made up of few and transitory pains,
and many various pleasures'. Mill argues that when
happiness is understood like this, it is attainable,
and while we can't always expect pleasure,
we can diminish suffering over time.  ^nWPChdz2

Higher and Lower Pleasures ^bTSokMIy

Mill says that we can distinguish between
'higher' and 'lower' pleasures. 'Lower'
pleasures are those associated with
physical/sensual gratification, and 'higher'
pleasures are those associated with the
gratification of our higher emotional and
intellectual capabilities.

Mill says that we can test for higher
pleasures through a 'test of competent
judges', i.e. only the competent judge can
distinguish the higher from lower pleasures
by virtue of having extensively experienced
both types of pleasure.
 ^xhyPaEeB

Critics of the higher/lower pleasure
distinction argue that humans do
not reliably choose higher over
lower pleasures. However, Mill responds
by saying that there is a difference
between 'preference' and 'action'. The
reason that we may not act in accordance
with what we know would be of greater
value is laziness, weakness of will, or
lack of readily available pleasure. ^pUBHoWYc

Hedonistic vs Non-Hedonistic ^gt06YOyo

Smart argues that some, including G.E Moore,
are 'ideal' Utilitarians. This is because they
reject the argument that pleasure is the only
good, and argue that there are other states
of mind, such as knowledge. ^FtIsQeia

Equality of Pleasure ^WVQMATeE

Smart agrees with Mill that not all pleasures
are equal. He proposes a thought experiment:
at the press of a button, electrodes cause an
experience of intense sensory pleasure, and no
associated pain. Smart asks whether we would
say that this is the ideal? Would we prefer
this? Mill and Moore would say no, becuase  ^Fln1JLLa

we would prefer a life in which there
is scope for satisfaction of thought,
feeling, and imagination. Bentham, by
contrast, would answer 'yes'. ^4KjYZmve

Smart claims that Mill is not a 'pure' hedonist,
as his view can only defend higher pleasures in
terms of their fecundity. Smart says that our
attitude to pleasure is important. Mill's
distinction between higher and lower pleasures
implies something different to pure hedonism.
Mill's introduction of a qualitative element
distinguishes his form of Utilitarianism.
Higher pleasures are higher because
they help us to realise our unique intellectual
and emotional capabilities, i.e. because we
'approve' of them. ^1DoAACKu

Smart introduces the idea of the Sadist. He
argues that, whilst the sadist is happy, we do
not approve of his happiness. Smart says that
we need to distinguish between the pleasure itself
and its consequences. No pleasure, he argues, is
intrinsically bad. ^eg4Kin4p

A Criticism of Mill ^wPZs1WLy

Quality of Pleasure ^2j54EKYZ

Equality of Pleasure ^8KeOFww1
