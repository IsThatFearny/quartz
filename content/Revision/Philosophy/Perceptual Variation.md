Perceptual Variation ^yrn4CrRF

Bertrand Russel gives an example of looking at a shiny, brown table. We say it is brown, but it doesn't
actually look an even brown colour all over - depending on how the light falls, some parts are lighter
than others. So Russel objects to Direct Realism, arguing that saying 'the table is brown' means no
more than that it looks brown 'to a normal spectator from an ordinary point of view under usual
conditions of light. Russel then applies the same argument for properties of texture and shape. The
table might be smooth to touch, but at a microscopic level there are all sorts of bumps - should we
say that when we touch the table, the smoothness that we feel is a property of the table? And the
shape that something appears to have, like its colour, varies with the angle from which you view it.

These examples draw our attention to a distinction between appearance and reality. Whilst we often
talk of things as if they are just as they seem, we also distinguish between appearance and reality.
This perceptual variation causes a problem for the Direct Realist. ^09wenMAT

P1. There are variations in perception

P2. Our perception varies without corresponding changes in the
    physical object we perceive

C1. Therefore, the properties that physical objects have and the
    the properties that they appear to have are not identical

C2. Therefore, what we are immediately aware of in perception is
     not exactly the same as what exists independently of our minds

C3. Therefore, we do not perceive physical objects directly ^aK5irtxk
