## Utilitarianism

</br>

### Explain why utilitarianism has an issue with partiality

Utilitarianism is the theory that we should act according to the ‘utility principle’, i.e. choose the action which brings about the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Here, we define ‘happiness’ as ‘pleasure and the absence of pain’. We can object to utilitarianism by arguing that it does not respect partiality. It seems to argue that we should not respect our friendships and relationships as morally valuable, and that instead we should devote all of our time and resources to helping those who need it most. Take, for example, a man who is faced with the choice of saving two people from drowning. One is his wife, and the other is a complete stranger, but who will go on to cure cancer. Utilitarianism would argue that the man should save the stranger, because their being alive will produce the greatest happiness and the least pain. But is this the morally correct decision? Surely, we can ask, partiality carries some significance in morality? If it doesn’t, this seems to heavily conflict with human nature and the structure of our society, and so Utilitarianism seems like a highly incompatible theory.

### Explain how an Act Utilitarian would make a moral decision

An act utilitarian would use the felicific calculus as a guideline to make a moral decision. They would take into account the seven parts of the calculus: fecundity, propinquity, certainty, extent, intensity, purity, and duration; and would use these criterion to calculate whether the course of action that they are taking is morally correct. If the pleasure is pure, certain, far-reaching, long-lasting, in close temporal proximity, intense, and likely to lead to more pleasure, then this is the correct course of action, as it would maximise the greatest happiness.

### Explain the issue of circularity involved in Aristotle’s definition of virtuous acts

Aristotle defines a virtuous act as an act that a virtuous person would do, and defines a virtuous person as someone who does virtuous acts. This is a circular definition, because we cannot define a virtuous act without also defining a virtuous person, and we cannot define a virtuous person without defining virtuous acts. This would mean that it is impossible for us to know how to become virtuous, as they cannot follow the example of a virtuous person.

### Explain the criticism that Utilitarianism could lead to the tyranny of the majority

Mill takes issue with Utilitarianism, and is concerned that it could lead to the tyranny of the majority, where the happiness of the majority (i.e. the greatest happiness) overrules the happiness of the minority, even if the balance is 51% to 49%. This would mean that a large number of people’s happiness is not maximised because the happiness of another large number of people is considered more important.

### Explain the analogy drawn between virtues and skills within Aristotelian Ethics

Virtues are analogous with skills in Virtue Ethics. Take for example, playing the piano. One is not simply born with the ability to play the piano - you must practise it to get better. The same applies to virtues, which must be practised in order to be improved on. Furthermore, learning to play the piano is not a process whereby you follow instructions from your teacher exactly. At a certain level, you become more independent, able to learn by yourself and to use your skills in different circumstances without external direction. Similarly, in practising virtues, one cannot consider themselves a virtuous person until they understand how to act virtuously in any given situation. You must develop practical reason to be able to make moral decisions in different circumstances.

### Explain what Kant means by the good will

Kant defines the ‘will’ as our ability to make choices by thinking critically and using rational thought. By the ‘good will’, Kant means acting out of duty, i.e. motivated by your duty to yourself, others, etc. He argues that the good will is the only thing that is good without qualification, needing no reasoning behind it to define it as such. The good will is good in itself, and we do not define it by its consequences - a person can fail in doing something, and still be praised for their good actions.

### Briefly explains Mill’s distinction between higher and lower pleasures

Mill distinguishes between two different types of pleasure, higher and lower. Lower pleasures, he argues, satisfy our primal/animal instincts, i.e. physical pleasure such as sex. Higher pleasures, in contrast, satisfy those wants and needs which appeal to those aspects which distinguish us from animals, such as our ability to reason rationally, enjoy intellectual pursuits, etc. We can distinguish between the two through the ‘test of competent judges’, which means asking those who have experienced both types of pleasure which they prefer. Whichever they prefer is a higher pleasure. Note that Mill argues we can choose lower pleasures over higher pleasures in a given circumstance, but we still acknowledge that we have chosen the ‘wrong’ type of pleasure.

### Explain the difference between act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism

Act Utilitarianism claims that we should act in a way that maximises the greatest happiness for the greatest number, by calculating the consequences of our actions every time we make a decision using a calculatory system such as Bentham’s felicific calculus. Rule Utilitarianism, in contrast, claims that we should act according to predefined rules about morality. These rules, argues the Rule Utilitarian, should be formulated in a way that if everyone acted on them, they would bring about the greatest happiness.

### Explain what Nozick’s experience machine is intended to show about act utilitarianism

Nozick’s experience machine thought experiment runs as follows: say that there was a machine, which, if a human was plugged into, would simulate the experience of a life with many pleasures, and very few pains. It would also simulate many achievements. The person experiencing this would not know that they were plugged in to the machine, and would belief that this experience is objective reality. The catch, however, is that one must choose to plug in forever, or not at all.

Nozick argues that most people would choose not to plug in, because we value being in contact with reality. However, Act Utilitarianism would have to claim that plugging into the machine is the morally correct course of action. This shows that Act Utilitarianism does not take into account other parts of morality, such as preferences and values. This objection forms the basis of Preference Utilitarianism.

### What is a contradiction in conception?

A contradiction in conception is a situation in which everyone acting on a maxim would cause a contradiction. For example, take stealing. If everyone acted on the maxim ‘to steal what I want, when I want’, then everyone would be able to steal. However, if everyone stole, then the concept of private property would become obsolete, and in turn, the concept of stealing would too, because what is stealing if not the theft of private property? Therefore, this maxim cannot be universalised, because if it were, then it would cancel itself out. A maxim cannot be universalised if it causes a contradiction in conception.

### How is a hypothetical imperative different from a categorical imperative?

Put simply, a hypothetical imperative is an ‘if’ statement, whereas a categorical imperative is unconditional. For example, the statement ‘if you want to pass the test, then you must study’ is a hypothetical imperative. If one didn’t want to pass the test, then they need not study, but if they do, then they must. This is a conditional statement. A categorical imperative has no such conditionality: one *must* act on it no matter what circumstances it is acted upon under.

### Briefly outline Kant’s second formulation of the categorical imperative

Kant’s second formulation of the categorical imperative is to treat others not as means, but as ends in themselves. In other words, we should not ‘use’ others to achieve our own ends, but should aim to achieve their ends as if they were our own. For example, marrying solely for money, rather than for love, but telling the other party that you love them, would violate the second formulation of the categorical imperative, because you have deceived your partner about your true intentions, preventing them from achieving their own ends (i.e. a happy, loving marriage), and you have used them as a means to your own ends.

### Briefly explain the criticism that Kant’s deontological ethics ignores the value of certain motives

Kant’s deontology claims that we must act out of duty in all circumstances. This insistence creates a conflict with other motivations. For example, if you visited your friend in the hospital because you cared about them and wanted to make sure that they were ok, then you are acting out of love or care. Because Kant argues that only actions that are done out of duty are morally good, actions such as this are morally wrong. A morally good equivalent, however, is if you went to the hospital to see your friend purely because you are motivated by a duty that you have because of friendship. Even if you don’t want to go, you must obey the duty you have. Even if there is no love or care involved in this action, Kant would argue that it is morally good because it is motivated by duty. It therefore seems that deontology ignores a very important aspect of morality, motivation.
