Issues for Act Utilitarianism - Calculation and Inclusion ^t4L1bcap

Argument ^LCN65v3Y

We must consider which beings we include in our calculation. Bentham argues that we should determine
this by asking 'can they suffer?'. There is nothing in his theory that causes us to privilege human
happiness over that of animals. Therefore, it would seem that the Utilitarian logic equates human
happiness with animal happiness. Singer argues that it is wrong to treat animals as unequal - it is
'speciesism', similar to sexism or racism. ^LfQvJJUk

Singer's response is that these differences are irrelevant, because both humans and animals share
sentience, and can therefore experience pleasure and pain, which means that, in terms of suffering,
animals should be treated as equal to humans. ^So1hT5fb

Discussion ^yP3Z1hrx

We can object that between genders and races, there is no difference in the essential capacities that
make us human: reason, use of language, depth of emotional experience, etc. But there is a clear
difference between humans and animals in these capacities.  ^VQuL6PEY

This intensifies the problem of calculation: if it is difficult to compare the happiness of humans, it is
infinitely more so to compare the happiness of humans and animals. Our inherited morality is of little
help here, as many cultures take no moral notice of animals beyond the prohibition of harm.  ^XWqdpP44

Singer responds by arguing that a new customary morality is needed that will create secondary principles
concerned with how we treat animals. This may not be perfect, but it is the best that we can do. ^LqGsOoSo
