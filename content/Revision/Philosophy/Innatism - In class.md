### Outline Plato’s ‘slave boy’ argument in favour of innate knowledge

Plato argues for the existence of innate knowledge (i.e. the theory that we are all born with some a priori knowledge already present) through his ‘Meno’s slave argument’. The argument runs as follows: Socrates approaches a slave boy, who has never been taught mathematics or geometry, nor given an education at all. He asks the boy a series of questions on geometry - about area, length, etc. - and the boy, with some prompting from Socrates, eventually arrives at the right answers, or at least corrects his previous mistakes. And this, without having ever been educated about the knowledge that he is applying in this scenario. Plato concludes that this circumstance is evidence for our having innate knowledge: the slave boy is putting his innate knowledge about basic mathematical concepts and geometry into practise.

### Explain the empiricist account of simple and complex concepts as an argument against innatism

In arguing against Innatism, the empiricist can appeal to the distinction between simple and complex concepts. The empiricist argues that simple concepts, such as ‘coldness’ and ‘hardness’, can be built upon by other simple concepts to form complex concepts such as a certain object. This object has the properties of ‘coldness and hardness’. This complex concept can be formed in this way, by building, or by *abstraction* - we form the concept of a dog through simple concepts such as ‘hairy’, ‘four legs’, ‘barks’, etc. This forms the concept of a dog without referring to a specific dog. The innatist argues that complex ideas can be formed a priori, as innate knowledge, however, the empiricist argues that, because these complex concepts can be broken down into simple concepts, this knowledge is not innate - the empiricist argues that simple concepts are ultimately derived from experience, and therefore so are complex concepts.
