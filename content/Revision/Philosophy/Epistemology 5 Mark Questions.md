## What is Knowledge?

</br>

### How does adding a “no false lemmas” condition to the tripartite definition of knowledge avoid Gettier problems?

The ‘No False Lemmas’ condition is a third condition that states ‘one’s belief that $p$ is not inferred from another claim’ (i.e. a false lemma). In Gettier’s original counter-example of Smith and Jones (Smith and Jones go for the same job; Smith overhears the boss saying that Jones will get the job; Smith sees Jones counting out ten coins from his pocket and forms the belief that ‘the man with ten coins in his pocket will get the job; Smith gets the job and by coincidence has ten coins in his pocket), Smith’s belief that ‘the man with ten coins in his pocket will get the job’ is inferred from a false lemma, namely the boss’s statement that ‘Jones will get the job’, and therefore it is not counted as knowledge under this new third condition.

### Explain the Reliabilist definition of knowledge

Reliabilism is the claim that knowledge can be defined as follows: Some claim, $p$, is true; one believes that $p$; and one’s belief that $p$ is formed by a reliable cognitive process. A reliable cognitive process is a process that tends to form a high proportion of true beliefs, such as vision or memory. Reliabilism overcomes Gettier cases because it denies Smith knowledge: his belief that ‘The man with ten coins in his pocket’ has not been formed by a reliable cognitive process, and therefore he has no knowledge. Reliabilism is advantageous because it allows children and animals knowledge, as they can use reliable cognitive processes.

</br>

### Explain the view that belief is not a necessary condition for knowledge

There is an argument to say that knowledge and belief are incompatible. This is because knowledge is, in theory, infallible, but belief is fallible. It cannot, therefore, make sense that belief is a part of knowledge, because if it were, then knowledge too would be fallible.

## Direct Realism

### Explain how the argument from hallucination presents an issue for direct realism.

Direct Realism is the view that we perceive mind-independent physical objects directly, i.e. we perceive the world exactly as it is. The argument from hallucination presents an objection to Direct Realism. It argues that, if Direct Realism were the correct theory of perception, any hallucination that we may have must be said to be reality. For example, if someone was dreaming about unicorns, then the Direct Realist must say that those unicorns are really mind-independent physical objects. Any other response would contravene Direct Realism. But unicorns don’t exist, and we don’t want to say that our dreams or other hallucinations are true to life. Therefore, Direct Realism cannot hold.
</br>

### Explain how the argument from illusion presents an issue for direct realism.

Direct Realism is the view that our perception of mind-independent physical objects is direct, and we perceive the world as it is in reality. However, the argument from illusion objects to this view. Suppose that there is a pencil in a glass of water. If we look at the pencil in the water, then it appears crooked, bending when it enters the water. But when we pull it out of the water, it appears straight. Of course, this is a result of refraction, but even so, the Direct Realist would have to say that the pencil, when it is in the water, is indeed crooked, because we are perceiving it directly. We know that this is not true, and it seems absurd to say that it is. Direct Realism therefore cannot hold, because if it did, all illusions would be called reality (incorrectly).
</br>
### Explain one way in which a direct realist could respond to the argument from illusion.

The argument from illusion argues that, under Direct Realism, all illusions must be said to be objective reality, and because this is an absurd proposition, Direct Realism cannot hold. However, the Direct Realist can reject this, appealing to the concept of relational properties. A relational property is a property that is dependent upon circumstances. Take, for example, a pencil that looks crooked in water as result of refraction. The Direct Realist argues that the pencil is not *actually* crooked in the water, but rather has the property of ‘*looking* crooked in water’. This is a relational property. If this is the correct interpretation, the Direct Realism holds in the face of illusions. 

</br>
### Explain how the argument from perceptual variation presents an issue for direct realism.

Direct Realism is the view that we perceive the external world (i.e. mind-independent physical objects) directly. However, we can object by appealing to perceptual variation, an argument which is presented by Russel. He argued that our perception of an object and its properties changes depending on the circumstances. Take, for example, a brown table. It is not the same, constant colour brown all over. There are lighter parts, even parts that are white due to the reflection of the light. To two different people standing in different places, the table looks a different colour, even a different shape. If Direct Realism is the correct theory of perception, then we must say that the table is perceived exactly as we perceive it under any circumstances, which means that objective reality is variable. This clearly cannot be correct - objective reality is just that, objective. Therefore, Direct Realism cannot hold in the face of this objection.

</br>

### How can the Direct Realist respond to the argument from Perceptual Variation?

Direct Realism is challenged by the argument from perceptual variation, i.e. the argument that our perception of the external world varies depending on the circumstances in which we perceive it. However, the Direct Realist can respond to this by appealing to relational properties. A relational property is a property that is dependent upon circumstances. Take, for example, a pencil that looks crooked in water as result of refraction. The Direct Realist argues that the pencil is not *actually* crooked in the water, but rather has the property of ‘*looking* crooked in water’. This is a relational property. In the case of the table, ‘looking’ a certain colour is distinct from actually being that colour. Therefore, Direct Realism can overcome the objection from perceptual variation.

</br>

## Indirect Realism

</br>

### Explain Russel’s claim that the existence of the external world is the best hypothesis

One issue that faces indirect realism is that it leaves us doubting the existence of the external world, because sense-data is a ‘veil of perception’. Russel argues that, whilst this may be true, the existence of the external world is a better hypothesis than its non-existence. He gives an example of a cat. We look at the cat once, and it is sitting on the sofa. We turn our backs, and when we look back, the cat is now sitting on the floor. Russel says that there are two options to explain this. Either the cat moved from the sofa to the floor (through a series of intermediary positions); or the cat went out of existence when we looked away and reappeared in a different position when we looked back. Russel argues that the former explanation is the best, and this is the explanation which posits the existence of the external world. Russel therefore concludes that the existence of the external world provides a much better explanation for our perception than its non-existence.

### Explain how Berkeley’s Idealism differs from Indirect Realism

Berkeley’s Idealism, the claim that the content of our perception is mind-independent and caused by God, and Indirect Realism, the claim that we perceive the external world indirectly, have multiple important differences. Firstly, Idealism posits that the external world does not exist, whereas Indirect Realism argues that it does. Secondly, Idealism argues that God is the cause of our perceptions, but Indirect Realism argues that mind-independent physical objects cause our perceptions. Idealism argues that all of our perceptions, whether primary or secondary qualities, are mind-dependent. In contrast, Indirect Realism argues that only secondary qualities are mind-dependent and variable, and that primary qualities are fixed, constant, and mind-independent.
</br>

### Explain Locke’s distinction between primary and secondary qualities

In defending Indirect Realism, Locke posits the idea of primary and secondary qualities. He argues that mind-independent physical objects possess both types. Primary qualities are those which do not change depending on circumstances, such as shape (i.e. molecular structure), size, etc. These are mind-independent, and are the same between different people. In contrast, secondary qualities are those which change depending on the circumstance under which they are viewed, such as colour, temperature, etc. For example, depending on which angle I look at a table from, I might see it as being a slightly different shade of a colour than another person viewing the same table from a different perspective. Locke argues that secondary qualities are variable and mind-dependent.

## Rational Intuition and Deduction

### Explain Locke’s distinction between simple and complex concepts

In order to support his *tabula rasa* theory and reject innatism, Locke proposes a distinction between simple and complex concepts. Simple concepts, Locke argues, are basic: these include such properties as hardness, coldness, etc. We can use these simple concepts to form complex concepts. For example, we can combine hardness and coldness to form the complex concept of ice. We can also abstract simple concepts to form general concepts. For example, ‘has four legs, is fluffy, etc.’ applies to all dogs, not just a single dog, and so we can form concepts which generalise from simple concepts.

## Limits of Knowledge

### Explain Russell’s claim that the existence of the external world is the best hypothesis

In trying to prove that the external world exists, Russell proposes that its existence is the best hypothesis. Take these two statements: ‘the external world exists and it is the cause of our perceptions’; or ‘the external world does not exist and something else causes our perceptions’. Russell argues that the former is the most plausible and is supported by experience, and therefore, even though we cannot prove either statement, this is the best hypothesis and so should be taken as true. Russell argues that our experience supports this hypothesis using the following example: a cat is sitting on a sofa. I turn away, and when I turn around the cat is sitting on the floor. There are two explanations: either the cat went out of existence when I stopped perceiving it, and
