# China-Brain as a criticism of Functionalism#

</br>

**What is Functionalism?:** The view that to have a mental state is to have a functional state. A *functional state* is a state with an input and output in relation to a certain stimuli.

The aim of the china-brain thought experiment is to show that something functionally identical to the human mind can lack qualia. If this is the case, then functional properties â‰  mental properties, and so functionalism is false (there is some feature of mental states which functionalism does not account for).

**The thought experiment runs as follows:** The population of China is linked to each other via two-way radios in such a way as to recreate the pattern and functions of neurons and neural pathways. If Functionalism is true, this system directly replicates the mind to the extent that it would, for example, be able to feel pain.

Therefore, there is more to mental states than their function (inputs and outputs) and so functionalism does not satisfactorily/fully account for mental states.

#### Epiphenomenalist response

Epiphenomenalism can respond that qualia is a by-product of functional systems, so the China-brain will have qualia but this is not part of the functional system itself.
