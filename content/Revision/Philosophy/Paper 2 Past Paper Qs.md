#### Explain the difference between the claims ‘God is eternal’ and ‘God is everlasting’ (3 Marks)

The claim that ‘God is eternal’ is to claim that God has always existed atemporally (i.e. outside of time), and will always continue to exist. By contrast, the claim that ‘God is everlasting’ is to say that God will last forever, but exists temporally (i.e. within time). he has not *always* existed, and thus must exist uncaused. 


> [!NOTE] Mark
> ⅔ marks. Some imprecision in the definition of ‘everlasting’, as it does not entail that God has not always existed, but rather says that God has no beginning or end.

#### Explain the evidential problem of evil (5 Marks)

The evidential problem of evil states that, even if we accept the theodicies that are proposed as solutions to the logical problem of evil and thus accept that God might allow evil for the greater good, an omnibenevolent, omnipotent God would not allow disproportionate suffering, e.g. many evil people have very good luck and live happy lives, whereas many good people do not; or a deer taking days to die in a forest in the middle of nowhere. This kind of evil does not seem as if it is proportionate or serving any further purpose such as the greater of good, and so is at odds with the idea of an omnibenevolent and omnipotent God.

> [!note] Mark
> ⅘ marks. Included how evil in the world is disproportionate, but did not include reasoning as to the fact that an omni-God would reduce suffering to an absolute minimum.

#### Compare and Contrast Paley’s and Swinburne’s versions of the design argument

Paley proposes a version of the design argument in which he appeals to ‘parts organised for a purpose’ in order to prove the existence of God. Paley argues that, if we were to look at a watch, then we would see a very intricate and complex mechanical system, i.e. ‘parts organised for a purpose’. From this complexity, we can infer that there was a designer for the watch. Likewise, Paley argues, we can infer from the vast complexity of the universe’s ‘parts organised for a purpose’ that the universe, like the watch, also has a designer, and given such complexity, the designer must be God.

Swinburne rejects Paley’s design argument. Instead, he argues that there are two types of explanation: personal and scientific. We give a personal explanation of temporal order in human actions, e.g. such-and-such exists because I chose to make it; as such, we can give a similar personal explanation of why the laws of nature are the way they are - because God designed them in a certain way. There is no scientific explanation for this: science can explain assuming the laws of nature, but cannot explain such fundamental laws itself. Therefore we only have a personal explanation, and as such, we can argue that god exists. Swinburne’s argument, unlike Paley’s, does not appeal to spatial order (a major weakness of Paley’s argument), but rather appeals to temporal order.

#### Outline Descartes’ conceivability argument for substance dualism

Descartes argues that it is possible for us to conceive of mind as a separate substance to the body, because we have a clear and distinct idea of the mind as a non-extended, thinking thing, and of the body as an extended, non-thinking thing
