### Innatism vs Empiricism

**Intro:** Rationalist approach that claims that we can have some synthetic a priori knowledge of the world a priori. Arguing that innatism is wrong, because the empiricist account seems more reasonable

**Paragraph 1:** Experience only informs us of a singular moment in time, and it never tells us how the world *must* be. Necessary truths about the world are true because they *must* be true. Leibniz argues that we do not, therefore, gain truths about the world from experience, and instead we should regard them as innate. Argues for ‘intellectual ideas’, which originate in reflection (attending to what is already is in our minds) - we gain concepts such as unity, action, pleasure, etc. and can then apply these concepts in our experience
**Response:** Concepts such as unity and separation can be observed being gained by babies when they e.g. separate and put together two building blocks. The baby is not triggering innate concepts, but rather are learning concepts through the trial and error of experience. Burden of proof remains on the innatist

**Paragraph 2:** Locke makes the assumption that innate knowledge is conscious and universal. Argues that for an idea to be part of the mind, the mind must be conscious of it, so innate knowledge is knowledge that the mind is/has been conscious of. There is some innate knowledge that children and idiots do not know. This knowledge is not innate. there can be no universalisable knowledge due to the existence of children and idiots, and therefore there is no innate knowledge. Locke argues that we have an innate capacity to know, but this does not entail that our knowledge is innate. Innatism is inadequate.
**Response:** Multiple misunderstandings. 1) Knowledge does not have to be conscious - we can know something without it being conscious of it; 2) Knowledge such as ‘it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be’ *is* universal, as we use it to distinguish between two concepts; 3) innate knowledge is more than capacity, but is instead a disposition. Innate knowledge arises is made to surface (triggered) by experience. Necessary truths may not be innate but potential knowledge of them is
**Response to Response:** Unsuccessful, as the account is unclear and lacks definition. Innate knowledge is defined as a ‘disposition’, ‘potential knowledge’, and ‘foundational knowledge’. If we are unable to define Innate knowledge, then it seems absurd to adopt this account

**Paragraph 3:** Locke is still able to weaken the innatist claim by arguing that there are no innate concepts: 1) babies are born with no concepts aside from those experienced in the womb; 2) the concept of God is not innate; 3) for a concept to be unconscious it must be lodged in the memory. Idea of innate concepts is highly implausible
**Response:** 1) babies are born with the disposition to form concept but need experience to build on these; 2) a matter of language - everybody has the innate concept of a higher being; 3) innate concept are neither new nor lodged in the memory, but are dispositions that we may not be conscious of
**Response to response:** Overcomplicates our understanding of how we gain knowledge. According to Ockham’s razor, the empiricist claim proves simpler and more plausible. Locke’s *tabula rasa* theory also proves simpler. Locke’s account is simpler overall.

**Conclusion:** Few good reasons to stick with the innatist claim, as empiricism is more simpler and thus more plausible.
