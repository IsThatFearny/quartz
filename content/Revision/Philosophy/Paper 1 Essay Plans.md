## Epistemology

### JTB

**Intro:** Outline Justified True Belief. Outline Gettier cases and explain why they counter JTB. Will conclude that Virtue Epistemology is best

**Paragraph 1:** Explain No False Lemmas (Truth + Belief + Belief does not arise from a false lemma). Overcomes gettier cases because Smith’s belief arises from a false lemma: that ‘Jones will get the job’. Strengthens justification.
**Response:** We can construct counter-examples, e.g. dr jones and the virus. Jones’ belief is true and it did not arise from a false lemma, but we would still want to deny her knowledge. Just one counter-example is enough to cause us to look for another theory.

**Paragraph 2:** Explain Infallibilism, including argument for it: no one can know what is false; ∴ if I know that P, I cannot be mistaken about P; ∴ for justification to secure knowledge, justification must guarantee truth; ∴ if I am justified in believing that P, I cannot possibly be mistaken; ∴ if it is possible that I am mistaken then I cannot be justified in believing that P. Therefore infallibalism is true. Overcomes gettier cases because it strengthens the third condition to the point that, because Smith is not entirely certain about his belief, he does not have knowledge.
**Responses:** 1) It is rare that we have full certainty in the justification for our belief, and therefore infallibilism entails that we have little to no knowledge; 2) the argument for infallibilism commits the fallacy of equivocation, equivocating the statements ‘I am not’ and ‘I cannot be’.

**Intermediary paragraph:** Zagzebski correctly argues that the reason the previous two have failed is because they have merely strengthened the third condition, but gettier cases take advantage of the ‘truth gap’ between truth and the third condition. Thus, a correct definition of knowledge is one that bridges said truth cap. Cue VE

**Paragraph 3:** Explain Zagzebski’s definition of of VE (true, believed, and arises from an intellectual virtue). Clarify intellectual virtues. Explain how it bridges truth gap and thus prevents gettier cases. Explain Sosa’s ‘Triple A’ definition of knowledge and how *that* bridges the truth gap.
**Responses:** Seems to rule out children and animals from having knowledge - they seem incapable of possessing intellectual virtues, but can possess knowledge. However, if we define virtue broadly enough, to include automatic actions such as looking or remembering; Henry in fake barn county - analysis is too vague, we need to know more about what it is for a belief to be true because it arises from acts of intellectual virtue - this does not necessarily rule VE out, and it is certainly better than infallibilism and NFL.

**Conclusion:** VE is the best definition of knowledge, as it overcomes the truth gap and thus gettier cases as well. Despite criticism that it is vague, it is still better than Infallibilism and NFL, and this vagueness does not entirely knock the theory down

### Direct Realism


**Intro:** Explain Direct Realism - ‘what we see is what exists in the mind-independent external world’. Highly intuitive. This essay shall argue that Direct Realism cannot hold, because it fails to account for hallucination and 

**Paragraph 1:** Explain perceptual variation: Russell and the brown table. Direct Realism must claim that as our perspective changes, the physical object also changes, which is highly implausible.
**Response:** Direct Realist can appeal to relational properties. Table has the property of looking a certain color/shape from a certain perspective. Direct Realism does not claim that we perceive all of the properties of the table directly - it only needs to claim that we perceive enough directly to make out the fact that what we are looking at is indeed a brown table.

**Paragraph 2:** We can object from illusion: the pencil looks crooked in water, but isn’t. Direct Realism must claim that is crooked, but this is claiming something that is objectively wrong.
**Response:** The Direct Realist can again appeal to relational properties: the pencil has the relational property of *looking* crooked in water, rather than actually being crooked
**Response to response:** The appeal to relational properties does not work when hallucination

### Innatism vs Empiricism

**Intro:** Rationalist approach that claims that we can have some synthetic a priori knowledge of the world a priori. Arguing that innatism is wrong, because the empiricist account seems more reasonable

**Paragraph 1:** Experience only informs us of a singular moment in time, and it never tells us how the world *must* be. Necessary truths about the world are true because they *must* be true. Leibniz argues that we do not, therefore, gain truths about the world from experience, and instead we should regard them as innate. Argues for ‘intellectual ideas’, which originate in reflection (attending to what is already is in our minds) - we gain concepts such as unity, action, pleasure, etc. and can then apply these concepts in our experience
**Response:** Concepts such as unity and separation can be observed being gained by babies when they e.g. separate and put together two building blocks. The baby is not triggering innate concepts, but rather are learning concepts through the trial and error of experience. Burden of proof remains on the innatist

**Paragraph 2:** Locke makes the assumption that innate knowledge is conscious and universal. Argues that for an idea to be part of the mind, the mind must be conscious of it, so innate knowledge is knowledge that the mind is/has been conscious of. There is some innate knowledge that children and idiots do not know. This knowledge is not innate. there can be no universalisable knowledge due to the existence of children and idiots, and therefore there is no innate knowledge. Locke argues that we have an innate capacity to know, but this does not entail that our knowledge is innate. Innatism is inadequate.
**Response:** Multiple misunderstandings. 1) Knowledge does not have to be conscious - we can know something without it being conscious of it; 2) Knowledge such as ‘it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be’ *is* universal, as we use it to distinguish between two concepts; 3) innate knowledge is more than capacity, but is instead a disposition. Innate knowledge arises is made to surface (triggered) by experience. Necessary truths may not be innate but potential knowledge of them is
**Response to Response:** Unsuccessful, as the account is unclear and lacks definition. Innate knowledge is defined as a ‘disposition’, ‘potential knowledge’, and ‘foundational knowledge’. If we are unable to define Innate knowledge, then it seems absurd to adopt this account

**Paragraph 3:** Locke is still able to weaken the innatist claim by arguing that there are no innate concepts: 1) babies are born with no concepts aside from those experienced in the womb; 2) the concept of God is not innate; 3) for a concept to be unconscious it must be lodged in the memory. Idea of innate concepts is highly implausible
**Response:** 1) babies are born with the disposition to form concept but need experience to build on these; 2) a matter of language - everybody has the innate concept of a higher being; 3) innate concept are neither new nor lodged in the memory, but are dispositions that we may not be conscious of
**Response to response:** Overcomplicates our understanding of how we gain knowledge. According to Ockham’s razor, the empiricist claim proves simpler and more plausible. Locke’s *tabula rasa* theory also proves simpler. Locke’s account is simpler overall.

**Conclusion:** Few good reasons to stick with the innatist claim, as empiricism is more simpler and thus more plausible.
