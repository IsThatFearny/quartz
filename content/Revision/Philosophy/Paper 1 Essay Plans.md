## Epistemology

### JTB

**Intro:** Outline Justified True Belief. Outline Gettier cases and explain why they counter JTB. Will conclude that Virtue Epistemology is best

**Paragraph 1:** Explain No False Lemmas (Truth + Belief + Belief does not arise from a false lemma). Overcomes gettier cases because Smith’s belief arises from a false lemma: that ‘Jones will get the job’. Strengthens justification.
**Response:** We can construct counter-examples, e.g. dr jones and the virus. Jones’ belief is true and it did not arise from a false lemma, but we would still want to deny her knowledge. Just one counter-example is enough to cause us to look for another theory.

**Paragraph 2:** Explain Infallibilism, including argument for it: no one can know what is false; ∴ if I know that P, I cannot be mistaken about P; ∴ for justification to secure knowledge, justification must guarantee truth; ∴ if I am justified in believing that P, I cannot possibly be mistaken; ∴ if it is possible that I am mistaken then I cannot be justified in believing that P. Therefore infallibalism is true. Overcomes gettier cases because it strengthens the third condition to the point that, because Smith is not entirely certain about his belief, he does not have knowledge.
**Responses:** 1) It is rare that we have full certainty in the justification for our belief, and therefore infallibilism entails that we have little to no knowledge; 2) the argument for infallibilism commits the fallacy of equivocation, equivocating the statements ‘I am not’ and ‘I cannot be’.

**Intermediary paragraph:** Zagzebski correctly argues that the reason the previous two have failed is because they have merely strengthened the third condition, but gettier cases take advantage of the ‘truth gap’ between truth and the third condition. Thus, a correct definition of knowledge is one that bridges said truth cap. Cue VE

**Paragraph 3:** Explain Zagzebski’s definition of of VE (true, believed, and arises from an intellectual virtue). Clarify intellectual virtues. Explain how it bridges truth gap and thus prevents gettier cases. Explain Sosa’s ‘Triple A’ definition of knowledge and how *that* bridges the truth gap.
**Responses:** Seems to rule out children and animals from having knowledge - they seem incapable of possessing intellectual virtues, but can possess knowledge. However, if we define virtue broadly enough, to include automatic actions such as looking or remembering; Henry in fake barn county - analysis is too vague, we need to know more about what it is for a belief to be true because it arises from acts of intellectual virtue - this does not necessarily rule VE out, and it is certainly better than infallibilism and NFL.

**Conclusion:** VE is the best definition of knowledge, as it overcomes the truth gap and thus gettier cases as well. Despite criticism that it is vague, it is still better than Infallibilism and NFL, and this vagueness does not entirely knock the theory down

### Direct Realism


**Intro:** Explain Direct Realism - ‘what we see is what exists in the mind-independent external world’. Highly intuitive. This essay shall argue that Direct Realism cannot hold, because it fails to account for hallucination.

**Paragraph 1:** Explain perceptual variation: Russell and the brown table. Direct Realism must claim that as our perspective changes, the physical object also changes, which is highly implausible.
**Response:** Direct Realist can appeal to relational properties. Table has the property of looking a certain color/shape from a certain perspective. Direct Realism does not claim that we perceive all of the properties of the table directly - it only needs to claim that we perceive enough directly to make out the fact that what we are looking at is indeed a brown table.

**Paragraph 2:** We can object from illusion: the pencil looks crooked in water, but isn’t. Direct Realism must claim that is crooked, but this is claiming something that is objectively wrong.
**Response:** The Direct Realist can again appeal to relational properties: the pencil has the relational property of *looking* crooked in water, rather than actually being crooked

**Response to response (Paragraph 3):** The appeal to relational properties does not work when we object from hallucination. By its very nature, a hallucination can have no relational properties, because it is not physical. Hallucinations are indistinguishable from veridical perception, and so it is impossible to tell, under Direct Realism, whether we are hallucinating or not

**Conclusion:** Direct Realism fails to account for hallucination, and thus leaves open the possibility that we could be hallucinating all of our perceptions, and therefore they cannot be trusted. Such a possibility renders Direct Realism relatively useless, and thus it cannot hold.
</br>
 
### Indirect Realism

**Intro:** Explain Indirect Realism. Clarify sense-data. This essay will argue that Indirect Realism holds, because it does not lead to scepticism and can account for hallucination and perceptual variation.

**Paragraph 1:** Perceptual variation and primary and secondary qualities. Primary are those which do not change, secondary are those which do change depending on circumstances. Perceptual experiences of primary qualities  resemble physical objects, and secondary qualities are the result of the primary qualities of an object’s ‘imperceptible parts’. We experience secondary qualities, and don’t perceive objects directly.
**Response:** This leads to scepticism. veil of perception - the only access to physical objects that we have is through sense-data, but because this sense-data is not an exact replica of the external world, we cannot *know* physical objects, or even if they exist.
**Response to response:** Russell claims that the existence of the external world is the best hypothesis. Either physical objects exist and cause my sense-data, or they do not exist and thus do not cause my sense-data. Both claims are hypotheses. The former is more plausible and therefore better. Therefore, the external world exists and is the cause of my perceptions, e.g. cat example.

**Paragraph 2:** In response to scepticism, Locke argues from involuntary nature of perception and coherence (+trotter cockburn). Locke gives an example: I know from experience that I can change how a piece of paper looks like by writing on it. I can plan what to write and know what the paper will look like. But I cannot bring about this sense-data just by willing it, nor can I change what it looks like once I have written. Sense-data are not merely ‘playthings of the imagination’. 

**Paragraph 3:** Berkeley: mind-dependent ideas cannot be like mind-independent objects. Locke claims that primary qualities resemble the attached physical objects. However, Berkeley asks how our sense-data, which is perpetually fleeting and variable, ‘resemble’ primary qualities, which are ‘fixed and constant’? Further, physical objects are not something that we experience directly; we only experience the sense-data that they cause. How can something that we do not experience be like something that *is* experienced? If indirect realism is true, then we cannot know the nature of mind-independent physical objects
**Response:** Indirect Realists argue that sense-data represent physical objects, even if it does not resemble physical objects. The pattern of causal relations between the external world and our sense-data is very detailed and systematic, and we can explain representation in terms of this complex causation.
**Response to response:** Causes and effects can be very different, and if we understand representation just in terms of detailed and systematic causal relation, then it seems we still won’t know what mind-independent objects are like in themselves.

**Conclusion:** Indirect Realism holds, as it can overcome scepticism, and account for hallucination and perceptual variation

</br>

### Idealism

**Intro:** Explain Idealism. This essay shall argue that Idealism is a plausible theory of perception

**Paragraph 1:** Brief explanation of how Berkeley concludes that Idealism is the correct theory of knowledge. Specifically master argument. We can conceive of a tree that exists unperceived. Berkeley argues that our conception of said tree means that is impossible for such a tree to exist. We can think of the idea of a tree, but not of one that exists independently of the mind
**Response:** Berkeley has confused the thought of a tree with the subject of the thought: thoughts cannot exist outside of the mind, and therefore my thinking of a tree is not mind-independent. However, what a thought is about is not the same thing as the thought itself. ∴ just because my thinking of a tree is mind-dependent, it does not follow that what i am thinking of is also mind dependent. The master argument does not show that it is impossible to conceive of a tree that may exist when no one is thinking of it.

**Paragraph 2:** Berkeley and God: There are three causes of our perceptions - ideas, my mind, or another mind. Ideas cannot cause anything, because they are passive. My perceptions cannot depend on my mind, because if they did I would be able to control them; Perception is passive. The ideas that comprise physical objects must exist in another mind, which then wills that I perceive them. Given the complexity and systemacity of our perceptions, that mind must be God.
**Responses:** My perceptions and sensations are part of my mind, not God’s. God cannot have the same sort of perceptual experiences as me, because He does not perceive as I do. The ordinary objects of my perception change and go out of existence, but God’s mind is unchanging and eternal. Thus, what I perceive cannot be part of God’s mind
**Response to response:** 1) What I perceive is a copy of the idea in God’s mind; 2) The ideas of physical objects exist in God’s mind as part of God’s understanding. The same is true of sensations; 3) What I perceive, which changes, is what God wills me to perceive. The whole of creation exists in God’s understanding eternally.

**Paragraph 3:** Hallucination. Idealism does not distinguish between appearance and reality, and so would have to claim that hallucinations are the same as reality.
**Responses:** Hallucinations are ‘dim, irregular, and confused’, and are not coherently connected with the rest of our perceptions.
**Response to response:** These criteria mark a difference of degree - perceptual experiences can be more or less clear or dim, more or less coherently connected. But the difference between hallucination and perception is a difference in kind. Perception is the experience of something outside your mind, hallucination, of something within.
**Response to the response to the response:** Berkeley could agree with this, because the ideas that we perceive originate in God, but in hallucination they do not. His criteria are only supposed to indicate *how we can tell*.

**Conclusion:** Berkeley’s empiricism holds

</br>

### Innatism vs Empiricism

**Intro:** Rationalist approach that claims that we can have some synthetic a priori knowledge of the world a priori. Arguing that innatism is wrong, because the empiricist account seems more reasonable

**Paragraph 1:** Experience only informs us of a singular moment in time, and it never tells us how the world *must* be. Necessary truths about the world are true because they *must* be true. Leibniz argues that we do not, therefore, gain truths about the world from experience, and instead we should regard them as innate. Argues for ‘intellectual ideas’, which originate in reflection (attending to what is already is in our minds) - we gain concepts such as unity, action, pleasure, etc. and can then apply these concepts in our experience
**Response:** Concepts such as unity and separation can be observed being gained by babies when they e.g. separate and put together two building blocks. The baby is not triggering innate concepts, but rather are learning concepts through the trial and error of experience. Burden of proof remains on the innatist

**Paragraph 2:** Locke makes the assumption that innate knowledge is conscious and universal. Argues that for an idea to be part of the mind, the mind must be conscious of it, so innate knowledge is knowledge that the mind is/has been conscious of. There is some innate knowledge that children and idiots do not know. This knowledge is not innate. there can be no universalisable knowledge due to the existence of children and idiots, and therefore there is no innate knowledge. Locke argues that we have an innate capacity to know, but this does not entail that our knowledge is innate. Innatism is inadequate.
**Response:** Multiple misunderstandings. 1) Knowledge does not have to be conscious - we can know something without it being conscious of it; 2) Knowledge such as ‘it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be’ *is* universal, as we use it to distinguish between two concepts; 3) innate knowledge is more than capacity, but is instead a disposition. Innate knowledge arises is made to surface (triggered) by experience. Necessary truths may not be innate but potential knowledge of them is
**Response to Response:** Unsuccessful, as the account is unclear and lacks definition. Innate knowledge is defined as a ‘disposition’, ‘potential knowledge’, and ‘foundational knowledge’. If we are unable to define Innate knowledge, then it seems absurd to adopt this account

**Paragraph 3:** Locke is still able to weaken the innatist claim by arguing that there are no innate concepts: 1) babies are born with no concepts aside from those experienced in the womb; 2) the concept of God is not innate; 3) for a concept to be unconscious it must be lodged in the memory. Idea of innate concepts is highly implausible
**Response:** 1) babies are born with the disposition to form concepts but need experience to build on these; 2) a matter of language - everybody has the innate concept of a higher being; 3) innate concept are neither new nor lodged in the memory, but are dispositions that we may not be conscious of
**Response to response:** Overcomplicates our understanding of how we gain knowledge. According to Ockham’s razor, the empiricist claim proves simpler and more plausible. Locke’s *tabula rasa* theory also proves simpler. Locke’s account is simpler overall.

**Conclusion:** Few good reasons to stick with the innatist claim, as empiricism is more simpler and thus more plausible.

### Rationalism vs Empiricism

**Intro:** Define rationalism, define empiricism. Descartes attempts to prove that rationalism is true by arguing for our knowledge of three synthetic truths - ‘I exist’, ‘God exists’, and ‘the external world exists’ - through a priori rational intuition and deduction. Brief explanation of three waves of doubt This essay shall argue that he fails to prove rationalism

**Paragraph 1:** Descartes’ argument for the existence of the external world. I have perceptions of an external world. My perceptions are involuntary and so cannot be caused by my own mind. The cause of my perceptions must be something external to my mind. God exists. If the cause of my perceptions is God, then God has created me with a tendency to form false beliefs. God is a perfect being by definition and would not do this, meaning that I can trust my perceptions, and I can know that an external world exists.
**Responses:** 1) Causation: Descartes’ proof of the external world relies on knowledge of causation. However, causation requires experience. Hume would argue that there is no logical contradiction in the idea of a perception that has no cause and so we cannot know a priori that our perceptions are caused by something external. Relying on a posteriori knowledge causes Descartes argument to fail to prove rationalism; 2) Relies on Descartes’ arguments for God.

**Paragraph 2:** Descartes Trademark argument: I have the concept of God as something infinite and perfect. I am a finite and imperfect being. The cause of an effect must have at least as much reality as the effect. Thus, the cause of my idea of God must be an infinite and perfect being. ∴ God exists.
**Responses:** 1) Causation requires experience. ‘Everything has a cause’ can be denied without contradiction. Applying Hume’s fork, the statement is a matter of fact rather than a relation of ideas, and matters of fact are not a priori; 2) The concept of God comes from experience. Hume argues that we can create the concept of God by taking the finite and imperfect ideas that we gain from experience and extending these ‘beyond all limits’. The concept of infinity is merely a negation of being finite.

**Paragraph 3:** Cogito. ‘I think therefore I am’. If the evil demon is deceiving descartes, then there must be something to deceive in the first place. Thus, Descartes can be certain of his existence. Not only this, but the statement ‘I think therefore I am’ is a clear and distinct idea (we can know it through rational intuition), and therefore can be trusted as true
**Response:** Hume argues that we experience a constantly changing array of perceptions, but never a self. There is no evidence of a constant *thing* that can think. The evil demon could be creating disembodied false thoughts that ‘I exist’. There is no logical contradiction in this.

**Conclusion:** Descartes fails to prove that we can there are synthetic a priori truths, and thus fails to establish rationalism

## Moral Philosophy

### Utilitarianism

**Intro:** Explain Utilitarianism: Bentham and Mill. This essay shall argue that Utilitarianism fails as a moral theory overall

**Paragraph 1:** Higher/lower pleasures, test of competent judges, etc.
**Response:** the higher and lower pleasure distinction

point 2: objection from problems with calculation
counter: secondary principles
eval: this means it turns into rule U

point 3: rule worship
</br>

### Kantian Deontology

**Intro:** Explain Kantian deontology including categorical imperative and good will. This essay shall argue that Deontology does not hold.

**Paragraph 1:** Morally wrong universalisable maxims, e.g. to steal only from market stalls selling novelty umbrellas on a Wednesday, can be formulated
**Response:** Deontology is only concerned with my *actual* maxim, not some made up one. We must be honest about our maxims and the intentions behind them
**Response to response:** There are counter-objections which meet these criteria, e.g. borrowing money on the promise to repay it, but with no intention of doing so, as a way of getting money to buy food and shelter. Specific enough to be universalised, and honest. If we think that this is wrong, then the categorical imperative fails to give us the right answer

**Paragraph 2:** Conflicts between duties. Should I break a promise or tell a lie? Kantian deontology seemingly provides no way of resolving this conflict
**Response:** A real conflict of duties can never occur. If duties are absolute, then we must formulate our duties very carefully to avoid conflict. There will always be some maxim which we can act on which will be universalisable.
**Response to response:** It is more realistic to say that most duties are not absolute. Less important duties can give way to more important ones. This is at odds with Kant’s entire theory.

**Paragraph 3:** Consequences of actions determine their moral value. If it is my duty not to murder then this must mean that there is something *bad* about murder, and so we should prevent murder to the greatest extent possible. If killing someone (and thus breaking our duty) prevents further deaths, why should we not kill? I seemingly have a duty to do so
**Response:** Kant would argue that there are no ends that are good without qualification, not even happiness, and so this cannot be the right analysis of the good will. Kant disagrees with means-end reasoning, arguing that morality becomes a system of hypothetical imperatives.
**Response to response:** Foot - morality *is* a system of hypothetical imperatives. There is nothing irrational about disobeying the categorical imperative if you never accepted it in the first place, and treated your duties as hypothetical, i.e. *if* statements

**Conclusion:** Kantian deontology fails because it cannot resolve conflicts between duties, nor can the categorical imperative account for honest, universalisable, but still morally wrong maxims

### Virtue Ethics



</br>

### Moral realism

**Intro:**
- Outline moral realism - include naturalism vs non-naturalism; outline cognitivism (The claim that that moral statements are beliefs, and therefore have truth value)
- In this essay I shall argue that objective moral properties exist (for moral realism)

**Paragraph 1:**
- Hume’s fork
	- The claim that we can have knowledge of just two sorts of claim: relations of ideas or matters of fact
	- Relations of ideas and matters of fact are the only two types of judgement of reason
	- Moral judgements are neither relations of ideas (moral claims are not conceptual truths, it is possible to deny them without contradiction) nor matters of fact (We cannot find the property of moral wrongness through empirical investigation) and therefore moral judgements are not judgements of reason
	- This causes an issue for cognitivism, because according to Hume’s fork we can have no knowledge of moral judgements. This is because, Hume argues, moral judgements are neither true or false, but are non-cognitivist
**Response:**
- Moore
	- Moore denies Hume’s fork - moral intuitions are not relations of ideas in this sense because they are not analytical truths, instead they are synthetic propositions that are self-evident and so are not established the way that other, empirical matters of facts are.
- Mill (The reductive naturalist)
	- Mill’s proof of Utilitarianism gives us reasons to accept the empirical evidence of what people want as evidence for what is good

**Paragraph 2:**
- Verification principle
	- The verification principle states that a statement is meaningful only when it is either analytic or empirically verifiable
	- Ayer applies this principle to ethical language. Judgements such as ]‘murder is wrong’ are not analytically true, but empirical investigation cannot show them to be true or false either. Saying that $x$ is wrong cannot mean that $x$ would cause unhappiness, as Moore states. Ayer therefore agrees that ethical naturalism is wrong, because we cannot show that murder is wrong, due to lack of empirical evidence
**Response:**
- Verification undermines itself
	- The verification principle undermines itself, because the principle itself is not analytic and cannot be verified empirically. Therefore, the principle is meaningless, and what it claims cannot be true. Thus, there is no reason to believe that ethical is meaningless.
	- Despite Ayer’s response that the principle is a definition rather than an empirical hypothesis, we can argue that it is only as convincing as the arguments that try to show that it is the right definition of ‘meaningful’, and if we do not find this convincing, we can argue that the principle provides no independent support

**Paragraph 3:**
- Mackie’s argument from relativity
	- Relativity: Mackie observes that moral codes differ from one society to another. We may call this claim ‘descriptive relativism’.
	- Mackie says that this means that there are no objective moral truths. The realist must argue that these different societies are all trying to reach the truth about ethics. The moral relativist (Mackie) disagrees, arguing that this is implausible and we should understand the morality of a society as a reflection of its way of life.
**Response:**
- Chile plant example
	- Moral judgements that are relative are not objective - for example, ‘chilli plants grow well’ is a relative truth - it is true in one country but not another. We can turn this statement into a universal truth by stating the conditions that apply, e.g. ‘chilli plants grow well in hot countries’. This can be applied to moral judgements - some ethical practises will be permissible in some circumstances but not others. Someone’s intuition is objectively true if it is true in the conditions in which they live. Therefore, Moral Realism holds.

</br>

### Moral anti-realism
