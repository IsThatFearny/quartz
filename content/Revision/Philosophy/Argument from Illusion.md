# Text Elements
Argument from Illusion ^7BW1oWhN

In objecting to direct realism, we can appeal to illusion. If, for example, you look at a pencil half-submerged
in water, it looks crooked by it isn't. However, just from our experience, you can't tell whether you are seeing
an illusion or not. Someone who doesn't know about the illusion thinks they are seeing a crooked pencil. This
point applies generally to illusions. Without background knowledge, we cannot distinguish between illusion and
reality. ^CCgrSDX3

P1. We perceive something having some property F

P2. When we perceive something as having some property F, then there is something that is F

P3. In an illusion, the physical object does not have the property F

C1. Therefore, in illusions, what has the property F is something mental, a sense-datum

C2. Therefore, in illusions, we see sense-data, and not physical objects, immediately

P4. Illusions can be 'subjectively indistinguishable' from veridical perception

C3. Therefore, we see the same thing, namely sense-data, in both illusions and veridical perceptions.

C4. Therefore, in all cases, we see sense data, and not physical objects, immediately

C5. Therefore, direct realism is false ^26MIWU7X
