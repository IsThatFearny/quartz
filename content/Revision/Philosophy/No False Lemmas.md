# Text Elements
No False Lemmas ^XAMVM5KM

S did not infer P from a false belief. 'Jones will get the job' is a false lemma (claim made part way through an argument).
When NFL is used, the inference that Smith has made no longer satisfies the conditions for knowledge.

Zagzebski's Objection - Dr Jones and the Virus ^xLFodVLQ

Zagzebski raises the concern that there are Gettier Cases that satisfy the 'no false lemmas' condition without the person 
having knowledge, e.g. Dr Jones and the Patient. Dr Jones studies the symptoms of and runs tests on her patient, and diagnoses
him with having Virus X. No other known virus produces these test results or symptoms, and therefore Dr Jones has belief and 
justification that her patient has Virus X. Unbeknownst to her however, the symptoms and test results are actually a result of 
Virus Y. However, we know that the patient has just contracted Virus X, yet no symptoms or test results show this. This example 
satisfies all conditions for knowledge, including no false lemmas. P is true, justified, believed, and is not inferred from a false belief. 
And yet Dr Jones does not have knowledge. ^aFdHT1Ty
