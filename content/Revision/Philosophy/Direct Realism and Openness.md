Direct Realism and Openness ^jr5tr4sb

Direct Realism understands perception as 'openness' to the world, a direct awareness of
mind-independent objects. We can get a fuller sense of this by trying to describe what we
see. We would usually do so by referring to physical objects: 'I see a desk'. If we perceive
the world via sense-data, the immediate content of what we perceive is mental. It is very
difficult to describe, because our way of describing sense-data is dependent on concepts
of physical objects. We can't give an account of what we experience without referring to
physical objects.

This shows that our perceptual experience presents what we perceive as mind-independent
objects. That doesn't prove that we perceive mind-independent objects, but it does make
such a claim highly intuitive. Only direct realism holds onto this basic intuition of openness,
and it is therefore very counter-intuitive to think, therefore, that what we perceive are
sense-data. Any theory that claims that we perceive sense-data must also claim that
perception is not what it seems to be. It has to say that it seems that we immediately
perceive mind-independent objects, but we don't ^sdmJnrXP
