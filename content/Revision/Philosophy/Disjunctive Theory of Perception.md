Disjunctive Theory of Perception ^eWtKBR8M

Direct Realism can challenge P2 (when we perceive something as having property F, then
there is something that is F) by arguing that, if something looks a certain way, then one
of two quite different things is going on: either I directly perceive a mind-independent
physical object that is F, OR, it appears to me just as if there is something that is F,
but there is nothing that is F. According to the disjunctive theory of perception,
hallucinations, and veridical perception are two completely different kinds of mental state,
because in hallucination, the person isn't connected up to the world. The fact that
hallucinations are subjectively indistinguishable from veridical perception tells us nothing
significant about what perception is. In hallucination, we don't perceive anything, we imagine
it. To imagine is not to perceive something mental, but not to perceive anything at all.
Perception is a form of cognitive contact, hallucination is not. ^tTpHRYzY
