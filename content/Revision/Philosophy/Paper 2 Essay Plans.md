## Metaphysics of God

### Concept of God

**Intro:** Arguing that the concept of God is coherent. Define omnis and distinguish between eternal/everlasting

**Paragraph 1:** Paradox of the stone. Can god create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it? If God cannot create the stone, then this is a limitation on his power; if God cannot lift the stone, then this is also a limitation on his power. Either way, the judeo-christian concept of God is not coherent
**Response:** ‘A stone an omnipotent being cannot lift’ is a contradiction, because by definition an omnipotent being has absolute power over everything, and therefore such as stone could not exist - it is a logical impossibility. This is not a limit on God’s power, because we can define omnipotence as being able to do everything that is logically possible.
**Response to response:** This begs the question - it assumes that we can coherently talk of an omnipotent being. But if the concept of said being is self-contradictory, then we cannot do so. We cannot legitimately use the concept until we know that it is coherent.
**Response to response to response:** An improved response is as follows: saying that ‘God cannot create a stone that he cannot lift’ only means that ‘if God can create a stone, then He can lift it’. There is thus no limit on God’s power to lift stones, and so there is no limit on his creation of stones. Thus, God lacks no power relating to lifting or creating stones.

**Paragraph 2:** Free will vs. Omniscience:

**Paragraph 3:** The Euthyphro dilemma. Either God creates morality and can manipulate it at will, in which case his omnibenevolence is arbitrary, as there is no moral standard for us to benchmark benevolence; or God does not create morality, in which case God is not omnipotent, for he lacks the power to control morality, and, for example, make murder good. Thus the concept of God is incoherent
**Response:** God creates morality, and so he remains omnipotent, but this does not make morality arbitrary, because God does not invent morality for no reason - he acts out of other motivations, such as love. 
**Response to response:** Why does God love what he loves, and could he love something different while still being God? We cannot form a clear conception of this, and so the objection fades away.
**Response to response to response:** Morality is the same as what God wills, but ‘God is Good’ is not a tautology. ‘Good’ and ‘What God Wills’ are separate concepts, and people can understand the concept of goodness without the concept of God. However, these concepts refer to the same thing (as ‘water’ and H<sub>2</sub>0 relate to the same thing). It is not something independent which provides a standard for God’s will, as morality is dependent on God. We may need initially d
