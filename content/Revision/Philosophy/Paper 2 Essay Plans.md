## Metaphysics of God

### Concept of God

**Intro:** Arguing that the concept of God is coherent. Define omnis and distinguish between eternal/everlasting

**Paragraph 1:** Paradox of the stone. Can god create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it? If God cannot create the stone, then this is a limitation on his power; if God cannot lift the stone, then this is also a limitation on his power. Either way, the judeo-christian concept of God is not coherent
**Response:** ‘A stone an omnipotent being cannot lift’ is a contradiction, because by definition an omnipotent being has absolute power over everything, and therefore such as stone could not exist - it is a logical impossibility. This is not a limit on God’s power, because we can define omnipotence as being able to do everything that is logically possible.
**Response to response:** This begs the question - it assumes that we can coherently talk of an omnipotent being. But if the concept of said being is self-contradictory, then we cannot do so. We cannot legitimately use the concept until we know that it is coherent.
**Response to response to response:** An improved response is as follows: saying that ‘God cannot create a stone that he cannot lift’ only means that ‘if God can create a stone, then He can lift it’. There is thus no limit on God’s power to lift stones, and so there is no limit on his creation of stones. Thus, God lacks no power relating to lifting or creating stones.

**Paragraph 2:** Free will vs. Omniscience. For me to do an action freely, I must be able to choose between doing it and refraining from doing it. If God knows what i will do before I do it, then it must be true that I will choose that course of action. Therefore, it cannot be true that God knows what I will do beforehand, *and* at the same time be true that i do not do that action. Therefore, either I have free will and God does not know what I will do in the future (and thus his power is limited as he is no longer said to be omniscient); or I do not have free will and God is still omniscient, but he is no longer omnibenevolent, because lacking free will causes our lives to be meaningless. 
**Response:** Stump and Kretzmann: God knows about future events because all temporal events are present to God - his knowledge is atemporal. Thus, God does not *foresee* events, as there is no such thing as ‘before’ for God. God’s knowledge is ET-simultaneous with when they happen. God’s perception is of one eternal present. Thus, the argument’s assumption that God’s knowledge is temporal is incorrect.

**Paragraph 3:** The Euthyphro dilemma. Either God creates morality and can manipulate it at will, in which case his omnibenevolence is arbitrary, as there is no moral standard for us to benchmark benevolence; or God does not create morality, in which case God is not omnipotent, for he lacks the power to control morality, and, for example, make murder good. Thus the concept of God is incoherent
**Response:** God creates morality, and so he remains omnipotent, but this does not make morality arbitrary, because God does not invent morality for no reason - he acts out of other motivations, such as love. 
**Response to response:** Why does God love what he loves, and could he love something different while still being God? We cannot form a clear conception of this, and so the objection fades away.
**Response to response to response:** Morality is the same as what God wills, but ‘God is Good’ is not a tautology. ‘Good’ and ‘What God Wills’ are separate concepts, and people can understand the concept of goodness without the concept of God. However, these concepts refer to the same thing (as ‘water’ and H<sub>2</sub>0 relate to the same thing). It is not something independent which provides a standard for God’s will, as morality is dependent on God. We may need initially independent concepts of goodness and God’s will, and this is fine, as we can form these concepts as such; and once we come to believe that what is good is what God wills, then we may use what we believe God’s will to be to judge what is good.

**Conclusion:** All objections fail, and thus the concept of God remains coherent
</br>

### Ontological Arguments

**Intro:** Ontological arguments do not prove that God exists. Define ontological argument

**Paragraph 1:** Anselm’s ontological argument. By definition, God is a being greater than which cannot be conceived. We can coherently conceive of such a being. It is greater to exist in reality than in the mind (it is inconceivable that the greatest conceivable being does not exist). Therefore God must exist.
**Response:** Gaunilo’s perfect island. We can conceive of an island that is greater than any other island, and therefore, according to Anselm’s argument, such an island must exist. This is a ridiculous claim. 
**Response to response:** The ontological argument works *only* for God, and so the objection does not hold. Anselm argues that there is something incoherent in thinking ‘the greatest conceivable being does not exist’. By contrast, thinking ‘the greatest conceivable island doesn’t exist’ is coherent. God *must* be the greatest conceivable being, as his being the greatest is necessary to Him being God. Thus, God must exist to be the greatest conceivable being, because it is greater to exist in reality than in the mind.
**Response to response to response:** Anselm has not answered the essence of Gaunilo’s objection. If God doesn’t exist, then God isn’t a being at all, and if this is so, then he cannot be the greatest conceivable being. Thus, we must prove that God exists before arguing that he is the greatest conceivable being.

**Paragraph 2:** Descartes’ ontological argument. I have the idea of God, i.e. the idea of a supremely perfect being. Existence is a perfection, and therefore God exists.
**Response:** Kant: Existence is not a predicate. Applies to all ontological arguments. Kant argues that ontological arguments misunderstand what it means to say that something exists. Things do not have existence as they do other properties, and so existence cannot be a perfection. Anselm and Descartes take ‘God exists’ to be analytic, which means that it should ‘unpack’ the concept of God. E.g. ‘a triangle has three sides’ - the concept in the predicate, ‘three sides’, is part of the concept in the subject, ‘triangle’. Thus, the analytic truth ‘a triangle has three sides’ tells us about what triangles are. By contrast, ‘God exists’ is simply ‘God is’. It adds nothing to the concept of God, because ‘$x$ exists’ is a synthetic statement rather than an analytic one.

**Paragraph 2:** Malcom’s ontological argument. Either God exists or not. God cannot come into or go out of existence. If God exists, then He cannot cease to exist - his existence is necessary. If God does not exist, then He cannot come into existence. Therefore, if He does not exist, his existence is impossible, and so God’s existence is either necessary or impossible. The existence of God is only impossible of the concept is self-contradictory, and it is not. Therefore, his existence is not impossible, and so he must exist necessarily.
**Response:** Kant - existence is not a predicate
**Response to response:** Contingent existence is not a property, but Kant has not shown that *necessary* existence is not a property - he has not distinguished ‘God exists’ from ‘God exists necessarily’ to a sufficient extent. To say that God exists necessarily *is* to unpack the concept of God, and it is therefore an analytic judgement. The concept ‘necessary existence’ has a different logic than that of ‘existence’.
**Response to response to response:** The impossibility of the existence of God is not the same as the existence of something that is logically impossible. If God does not exist, then what makes God’s existence impossible is not the incoherence of the concept, but rather the self-contradiction in bringing into existence something that is not contingent on anything else for its existence. Thus, whether God’s existence is impossible or not rests on whether God exists or not, and we cannot know this. It begs the question.
</br>

**Conclusion:** All forms of the ontological argument are successfully defeated, and thus ontological arguments cannot prove that God exists.

### Teleological/Design Arguments

**Intro:** All teleological arguments fail, and even if they were to succeed, they fail to show that the designer is God.

**Paragraph 1:** Hume’s argument from analogy. In the organisation of parts for a purpose, nature resembles the products of human design. Similar effects have similar causes; thus, if the cause of the products of human design is an intelligent design, the cause of nature is an intelligent mind that intended the design.
**Response:** We cannot defend the inference from an effect that this argument makes, because it is at odds with our understanding of causation. The origin of the universe is unique. To make any inference about the cause of the universe, we therefore would need experience of the origins of many works, but we do not have this kind of experience. Therefore, we cannot know what caused the universe. Further, the inference of a designer is ‘useless’, because all we have to go on is our experience of nature - we cannot find out enough about designers or other worlds to draw any useful conclusions about nature or the designer.

**Paragraph 2:** Paley. Anything that has parts organised to serve a purpose is designed. Nature contains such things. Design can only be explained in terms of a designer, and said designer must have a mind and be distinct from what is designed (a mind is required to interpret purpose). Therefore, nature was designed by such a designer, and such a mind (‘God’) exists. Note that Paley can escape Hume’s prior objections because he does not offer an argument from analogy, and thus no ‘cause-effect’ reasoning - the design of the watch supports the inference of a designer.
**Response:** Natural selection is a better explanation, because it is simpler - we are not inferring some extra thing (a designer) but instead appealing only to what we know already

**Paragraph 3:** Is the designer God? Multiple arguments to question this. 1) Designers are not always creators; 2) Design may have resulted from many small improvements; 3) Designers can die as their creations continue; 4) There is no reason to think that the designer has no body; 5) the universe is not infinite, and so God cannot be inferred to be infinite; 6) The universe gives us no reason to say that the designer is perfect, but God is, so the designer cannot be God.
**Responses:** In response to (1) and (2), Swinburne invokes Ockham’s razor, to not unnecessarily multiply entities when one will do. In reply to (3), the objection only works if we are thinking in terms of spatial order. Temporal order requires that the agent is acting at that time. But God acts wherever the laws of nature hold, and so he must continue to exist. In reply to (4), it is better to say that God has no body, as this is a better explanation of how he can act everywhere in space simultaneously
**Response to response:** Paley has to accept (5) and (6) - if the designer is God, then many of His traditional qualities will need to be established by some other argument (e.g. problem of evil), and no such argument succeeds. Thus, the designer cannot be concluded to be God.

**Conclusion:** Neither the design argument from analogy or Paley’s argument succeeds, and even if one did, we could not guarantee that the creator is God.

### Cosmological arguments

**Intro:** The cosmological argument succeeds, as Leibniz’s argument rescues it


**Paragraph 1:** Aquinas’ Second Way. We find in the world sustaining causes and effects. Nothing can causally depend on itself (to have the power to sustain its own existence it would already have to exist). Sustaining causes follow in logical order. If you remove a cause you remove its existence, and therefore if there is no first cause, then there will be no other causes. If there is an infinite regress of causes, then there is no first cause. Therefore, given that there *are* causes, there cannot be an infinite regress, and there must be a first cause. God is the first cause, and so he exists.
**Response:** An infinite regress is possible. The claim ‘there cannot be an infinite regress of causes’ is not an analytic truth, nor can we have experiences of this statement. It therefore seems conceivable that something has always existed and each thing has in turn caused the next.
**Response to response:** If paradoxes surrounding infinity cannot be solved, e.g. hotel rooms, universe getting older, etc, then to argue that an infinite regress is possible is a contradiction and therefore false. We cannot deduce this, and thus we do not experience to establish the claim.
**Response to response to response:** If there is not a first cause, then we cannot explain the subsequent series. We can explain one cause in terms of the preceding cause, but not why there is a series of causes in the first place.
**Response<sup>4</sup>:** Hume: ‘uniting’ the individual causes into a series is an ‘arbitrary act of the mind’. The series has no separate existence that needs causing or explaining. All that explanation requires is that each cause in turn is explained. We must look to arguments based on contingency.

**Paragraph 2:** Aquinas' Third Way. Things in the universe exist contingently; if it is possible for something not to exist, then at some time, it does not exist. If everything exists contingently, then it is possible that at some time there was nothing in existence. In this case, nothing could begin to exist. Since things *do* exist, there was never nothing in existence. Therefore, there is something that must exist, although not contingently. This necessary being is God.
**Response:** Hume: The causal principle is not analytic, as we can deny it without contradiction. We can thus argue that ‘something can come out of nothing’ or ‘I exist uncaused’. These claims are uncertain, because they can be true or false. We can know these claims from experience, but experience cannot establish a claim that holds universally (we have no knowledge of other worlds), and so we cannot know that everything, without exception, has a cause.

**Paragraph 3:** Leibniz's Argument from Contingency. Every true fact has an explanation that provides a sufficient reason for why things are as they are. There are two kinds of truth: reasoning and fact. Truths of reasoning are necessary, and their opposite is impossible. As such, the reasons for these truths can be found by analysis. Truths of fact are contingent and their opposite is impossible. Reasons can be given in intricate detail, but this detail only complicates further by bringing in more contingent facts. Each of these facts also needs to be explained. Therefore, by giving explanations of truths of fact, we move no closer to completely explaining contingencies. We must look outside the sequence of facts to provide sufficient reason. The sufficient reason must be in a necessary substance, which is God. This God is sufficient, because the necessary substance is sufficient.
**Response:** The impossibility of a necessary being. Nothing that is distinctly conceivable implies a contradiction. Whatever we conceive as existent, we can also conceive of as non-existent. Therefore, there is no being whose non-existence implies a contradiction, i.e. no necessary being.
**Response to response:** The concept of God is of such a being. We can argue that, if God exists, he exists necessarily. We should thus distinguish between necessary existence and existence. Hume and Russell may be right to argue that we can deny ‘God exists’ without contradiction. But, we cannot deny ‘God exists’ necessarily without contradiction. Thus, the argument provides a reason to think that such a God exists.

**Conclusion:** Whilst Aquinas’ Second Way (Causation) and Third Way (Contingency) both fail, Leibniz’s re-interpretation of the cosmological argument from contingency is able to overcome objections and thus succeeds.

### Religious Language


**Intro:** Religious language is meaningless

**Paragraph 1:** Verification principle. Religious language is only meaningful if it is analytic or empirically verifiable. In terms of statements such as ‘God exists’, we can neither prove this empirically nor is the statement analytic, because ontological arguments fail to establish the existence of God from a priori premises using deduction alone. Because most religious language relies on the statement ‘God exists’, we can argue that most religious language is meaningless.
**Response:** Rejecting the verification principle, because it is self-defeating. 
**Response to response:** The principle is intended as a definition rather than a hypothesis. It is not a criterion of literal meaning, but we can provide arguments in specific cases, such as religious language, which support it. 
**Response to response to response:** If we do not find the arguments for the VP convincing, then it provides no independent support… turn to FP

**Paragraph 2:** Falsification principle. We can replace the VP with the Falsification Principle, which states that a claim is only meaningful if it is logically incompatible with some set of empirical observations. For example, the statement that ‘all swans are white’ threatens to be deemed meaningless under the VP, because there might be a swan out there that isn’t white - we would have to check every single swan;     but under the FP, it is easy to prove false - observing a single black swan will prove the statement false.
**Response:** There are claims that are easy to verify but impossible to falsify, e.g. ‘there are three successive 7s in the decimal determination of π’. As soon as we find three 7s in a row, we have verification. But we can never show that this is false, because π is infinitely long. Similarly, existence and probability claims are difficult to falsify as well. Therefore, a falsification principle requiring a meaningful statement to entail decisive empirical evidence is unacceptable. If we were to weaken the principle to talk about evidence which would count against the truth of some claim, then it becomes indistinguishable from the VP.

**Paragraph 3:** University debate. Flew: for a truth claim to be meaningful, there must be some possible state of affairs it denies of rules out; to meaningfully assert a claim, someone must accept that it rules out some possible state of affairs; the occurrence of a state of affairs that a claim rules out demonstrates that the claim is false. To meaningfully assert a claim, someone must be willing to withdraw it if the state of affairs that it rules out were to occur; religious believers refuse to specify which state of affairs would cause them to withdraw the statement ‘God exists’; When religious believers make this claim, they do not rule out any state of affairs. Thus, the claim that ‘God exists’, when made by religious believers, is meaningless
**Response:** Mitchell disagrees with Flew’s claim that an assertion is only meaningful if we are willing to withdraw it - he gives the example of the ‘resistance fighter’. If the partisan refused to count the ambiguous actions (i.e. helping both sides) as evidence against his belief that the stranger is on the side of the resistance, then this would be irrational, and when applied to religious language, would void it of its meaning. But, Mitchell argues, simply allowing evidence to the contrary of your belief is not enough to relinquish said belief. In fact, we cannot say how much evidence is needed before one should withdraw a claim. Likewise, religious language involve a commitment - a claim can be meaningful without us being able to say what conditions would cause us to withdraw it, as long as we recognise that experience can count against our the view.
**Response to response:** Hare and bliks: rejects cognitivist position of Flew and Mitchell. He introduces the idea of *bliks*, i.e. attitudes towards certain things. E.g. if one is convinced that Oxford dons wan to murder him, no matter how much evidence is presented to the contrary, one will remain convinced of their belief. To hold the view that ‘God exists’, Hare argues, is a blik.
**Response to response to response:** Hare’s analysis entails that religious believers are acting irrationally. Flew objects that if religious claims aren’t assertions, then a claim such as ‘you ought to do it because it is God’s will’ becomes simply ‘you ought to do it’. But this is not what religious believers mean.

## Metaphysics of Mind

</br>

### Substance Dualism

**Intro**: Substance Dualism fails

**Paragraph 1:** Indivisibility argument. Physical is divisible, whereas mental is indivisible
**Response:** The mental is divisible in some sense - certain mental conditions or brain injuries can cause it to seem as if the mind is divided, and we can surgically separate the brain into two halves
**Response to response:** Descartes: minds are only functionally divisible, whereas bodies are physically divisible

**Paragraph 2:** Conceivability argument. I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking thing that is not extended; I also have a clear and distinct idea of body as something that is extended and non-thinking. Thus, God can create these things in a way that corresponds to my thought. Mind and body can therefore exist independently of each other, and are thus separate substances.
**Response:** What is conceivable may not be physically possible. Masked man fallacy: I believe that the masked man has robbed a bank, and I believe that my father has *not* robbed the bank. Thus, I conceive that the masked man is not my father; this is a logical impossibility. It is also metaphysically impossible that my father is the masked man, because one person cannot be someone else. Applying this to Descartes’ argument, we can argue that the mind may not be an ontologically dependent substance, and it would therefore be metaphysically impossible for it to exist separately from the body.
**Response to response:** Descartes is happy to grant that we cannot infer what is metaphysically possible from what we think, but in the case of clear and distinct ideas, this is justified. We can clearly and distinctly conceive that mind and body are separate substances, and therefore it is possible that they are. My concepts in the masked man fallacy are not clear and distinct.

**Paragraph 3:** Conceptual interaction problem. The movement of a physical object is initiated by some physical force, exerted at some point in space. If dualism is true, then the mind is not in space, and cannot exert any physical force. Therefore, if dualism is true, then the mind cannot cause physical objects to move. Therefore, either dualism is false or the mind cannot cause movement. The mind *can* cause the body to move, and so dualism is false.
**Response:** It is a mistake to try and understand the mind’s power to act on physical objects in terms of how physical objects act on each other - we have a tendency to conceive of all causation in terms of the causation of physical events by other physical events, but this could be mistaken.
**Response to response:** This provides us with no way of understanding how causality *does* work in substance dualism

**Conclusion:** The two arguments for dualism fail, and it fails to establish the functioning of causality in the theory
</br>

### Property Dualism

**Intro:** Property Dualism fails. Define qualia, supervenience, and property dualism

**Paragraph 1:** Philosophical zombies. Zombies (functional duplicates without qualia) are conceivable. If they are conceivable then they are possible. If they are possible then qualia are non-physical and do not supervene on the physical. If this is the case, then property dualism is true. It is the case, and so property dualism is true.
**Response:** What is possible tells us nothing about the actual world. At best, the argument shows us that physical and phenomenal properties are distinct in *another* possible world. but this does not entail that they are such in *this* world.
**Response to response:** Misunderstands identity. Nothing can be something else. I can’t not be me in another possible world. Likewise, if phenomenal properties are physical properties in this world, then they are such in every possible world, and if this is not the case, then it is not the case in any possible world. In terms of identity, possibility does tell us about reality.

**Paragraph 2:** Knowledge/Mary. Mary knows all physical facts about colour, but does not know what it is like to *see* colour (i.e. has no knowledge of qualia). What it feels like to see colour, therefore, is not a physical fact. Physicalism argues that all facts are physical facts, and so physicalism is false. Does Mary gain knowledge when she sees colour after being released from her black and white room? If so, then she does not know everything that there is to know, and therefore physicalism is false.
**Response:** Acquaintance knowledge. Mary learns something new, but her new knowledge is a type of physical knowledge, namely acquaintance knowledge. When Mary sees red for the first time, the property occurs in her brain and she becomes *acquainted* with redness. She gains new knowledge, but it is just physical acquaintance knowledge.
**Response to response:** Acquaintance knowledge involves propositional knowledge. When Mary becomes acquainted with redness, she also learns propositional facts such as ‘seeing red is like *this*’. Whatever acquaintance knowledge she does or doesn’t gain, it is difficult to deny that she also gains propositional knowledge, which is non-physical.

**Paragraph 3:** ???

### Behaviourism


</br>

### MBTIT

**Intro:** MBTIT claims that mental states *are* physical states. Overall, it…

**Paragraph 1:** Multiple realisability. Many different neurophysiological properties could realise pain. A human being and a dog could be in pain, but have different neurophysiological properties. Therefore, pain cannot be the exact same thing as property $N$. This is reinforced further if we consider the differences between humans and non-terrestrial species. If there are aliens, then they evolved completely separate from us, and so it is extremely unlikely that they will have the same physical states as us. But according to MBTIT, to have mental state $N$ is to have physical state $N$, and so the theory is making an implausible prediction.
**Response:** We should talk about ‘human pain’, which is a different property from, say ‘dog pain’.
**Response to response:** Pain is pain because of how it feels; thought is thought because of what is thought. A dog and a human being in pain share something in common. This is not to say that there is no relation between mental states and brain states, simply that they are not the same.

**Paragraph 2:** Indivisibility argument.
**Response:** Mind is also divisible
**Response to response:** Different types of divisibility - mind is functionally, body is spatially

**Paragraph 3:** Philosophical zombies. The existence of functional duplicates without qualia is possible. If they are possible, then MBTIT is false because if it were correct then zombies would be impossible.
**Response:** What is possible tells us nothing about the actual world. At best, the argument shows us that physical and phenomenal properties are distinct in *another* possible world. but this does not entail that they are such in *this* world.
**Response to response:** Misunderstands identity. Nothing can be something else. I can’t not be me in another possible world. Likewise, if phenomenal properties are physical properties in this world, then they are such in every possible world, and if this is not the case, then it is not the case in any possible world. In terms of identity, possibility does tell us about reality.

**Conclusion:** All objections to MBTIT succeed, and thus MBTIT fails
