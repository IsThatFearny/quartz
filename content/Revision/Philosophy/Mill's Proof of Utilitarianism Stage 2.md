Mill's Proof of Utilitarianism: Stage 2 ^9nB6renP

Here, Mill argues that not only is happiness good, but it is the only good. 
He says that happiness is comprised of many different things, each
of which is desirable in itself (e.g. truth, freedom, etc.). ^sMBloq08

External and Constitutive Means ^cqqqKkcv

An 'external means' is something that you might do to bring about a desired
result, for example, getting up early to catch a flight. You do this in order
to have a good holiday, but it is not part of having a good holiday. Later,
when you are lying on the beach in the sun, this just is having a good holiday.
Lying on the beach is a 'constitutive means' to the end of having a good holiday;
it is what having a good holiday amounts to.

Mill argues that the same applies to happiness. For example, when someone wants
to know the truth 'for its own sake', their knowing the truth doesn't cause their
happiness as a further and separate thing. Their happiness in this situation
consists in their knowing the truth. Knowing the truth is part of their happiness.
Mill therefore claims that whatever we desire for its own sake is part of
happiness. He argues that we should believe this because to desire something
just is to find it pleasant. It is impossible to desire something that you
don't think is pleasure. In sum, as pleasure is happiness, we only desire
happiness, and happiness is the only good. ^kRTeDlCU

Smart's objection ^Hq5wa4NR

Both preference Utilitarianism and Smart provide alternative
accounts of happiness and the good.

Preference Utilitarianism allows that if we understand pleasure
as a psychological state, we can desire something without thinking
it to be pleasant. What we desire is part of our happiness 
because happiness is the satisfaction of desires, not because
happiness is pleasure caused by the satisfaction of desires.

Smart adds an evaluative element. We are made happy by knowing
the truth because we approve of knowing the truth, and not simply
because it brings us pleasure (i.e. contentment). ^P9cH55z3
