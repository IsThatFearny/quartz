# How successful is Descartes' Rational Intuition and Deduction thesis?

</br>


#### Intro

Unsuccessful in establishing knowledge of synthetic properties a priori as they can be otherwise explained by empiricism/appeal to evidence and experience
</br>

#### Outline

Descartes’ cogito; clear and distinct ideas

</br>

#### Empiricist responses

Empiricist responses: knowledge of my own existence is a result of introspection; Hume - thoughts are momentary

</br>

#### Evaluation

Either the cogito is successful (thoughts require a thinker, etc.) or not completely failed, but is explained by empiricist means so is not a clear case of rational intuition. Assume that this works for now, and then assess God (conclusion correct, but not necessarily a priori)

</br>

#### Outline

Trademark argument

</br>

#### Empiricist responses

The concept of God is created from our experiences, e.g. ‘infinite’ is the negation of finite; omnibenevolence is an extension of love. Link to Hume and Locke - ideas, impressions, and thoughts are not unbounded

</br>

#### Evaluation

Hume’s fork - God’s existence is synthetic, so can only be known a posteriori. The empiricist shows that God is not a clear and distinct idea, and so his existence cannot be deduced from his properties. Descartes has not shown that God’s existence can be known a priori.
