Issues for Act Utilitarianism - Rights and Liberties ^8DMOiDWO

Utilitarianism argues for no constraints on producing the general happiness, e.g. even if the
torturing a child produces the general happiness, it is still the right thing to do. However,
many of our rights place these restrictions onto us, and therefore it would seem that
Utilitarianism argues that we have no rights.

Some Utilitarians accept this, arguing that as long as we consider situations realistically,
then whatever brings about the greatest happiness is the right thing to do. Any
counterexample that appeals to an unlikely scenario are irrelevant, because they have little
to do with real life. ^ISlaYtO5

However, even if this was true (which we can question), the theory still implies that, for example,
if it was very unlikely that someone would find out, then it would be right to torture children.
But we can argue that other people finding out isn't what makes torturing children wrong. By
ignoring rights, Utilitarianism misses out something that we would consider to be morally
significant.  ^1T3oNNRH
