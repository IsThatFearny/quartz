Truth and the Third Condition ^abYMB6mx

The Tripartite View and Reliabilism share a common approach to an analysis
of knowledge. They claim that knowledge is true belief with a third condition
that is closely connected to truth, but is independent from it. Gettier cases
show that the independence of this third condition allows the possibility that
it comes apart from truth - i.e. that a belief's truth value is lucky, rather
than a result of the third condition.

Zagzebski argues that as long as the third condition is independent, we will
always be able to construct Gettier cases which disprove the proposed
definition of knowledge. She argues that we need a definition of knowledge that
demonstrates both how and why truth and the third condition are connected,
and not merely added together. This connection must have something to do with
why knowledge is good in a way that mere true belief is not. ^0yzJ2G7h
