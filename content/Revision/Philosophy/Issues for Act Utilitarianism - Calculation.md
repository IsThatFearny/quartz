Issues for Act Utilitarianism - Calculation ^zjyPVpCq

Working out the consequences of an action may not be possible: it will be far too difficult
and time-consuming for us to effectively carry out, especially in a short space of time.
Bentham's felicific calculus is mind-boggling in practise, and it becomes incredibly hard to
get the relevant information to factor into our calculation. ^cRMWuLrt

Argument ^aCsIv2q6

N.B. Preference Utilitarianism might try to claim an advantage here: it is easier to know
whether a preference has been satisfied than it is to know how much pleasure someone
experiences. However, this is very little improvement if we still need to compare the
strength of different people's preferences, whether satisfying one preference leads to
further preferences being satisfied, etc. ^G2zSrvdj

Response ^CGvVslgj

This objection misrepresents the Utilitarian argument. Bentham does not say that an action
is right or wrong if it actually maximises happiness, but rather claims that it is right 'according
to the tendency which it appears to have' to maximise happiness. Precise consequences, he
argues, are irrelevant, because we can determine whether or not an action is 'right' if we can
reasonably expect it to maximise happiness. The felicific calculus needs not to be 'strictly 
pursued' before each decision is made, but simply 'kept in view'.

We must still work things out roughly, and Mill argues that this is still too demanding, as 
happiness is too complex. However, he claims that we don't need to try to calculate,
because over time, people have automatically worked out which actions tend to produce
happiness, which is the basis of our inherited moral rules. Mill calls these 'secondary
principles', and it is only in cases of conflict between these that we should need to
calculate. ^uImXMWVs
