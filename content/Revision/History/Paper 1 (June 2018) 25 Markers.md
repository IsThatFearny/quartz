‘Opposition from within the Communist Party posed a greater threat to Soviet leaders than that from opponents and cultural dissidents outside it.’
Assess the validity of this view of the years 1941 to 1964.
```

Both Stalin and Khrushchev faced opposition from both the general population of the Soviet Union and within the Communist party. This essay shall argue that the view that opposition from within the Communist party was a greater threat to the Soviet Leadership than external dissent is valid, largely because those within the party and close to the leadership were best placed to threaten Stalin and Khrushchev's power. This shall be concluded by evaluating how much of a threat external opposition was to each leader when contrasted with internal party opposition.

External opposition to Stalin existed, but was not only relatively limited, but was suppressed rapidly and ruthlessly. Stalin’s purges of ordinary citizens ensured that regular people lived in fear of being accused of being an ‘enemy of the state’ and deported, which prevented significant opposition from arising. Those who did dare to rebel were quickly arrested and subsequently deported, or more likely executed. The NKVD was an efficient machine, which was able to operate an effective police state within Russia. Stalin’s policy of punishing even minor dissent (such as the law which allowed for a maximum sentence of 10 years for a peasant caught stealing an ear of corn from a collective farm) is demonstrative of this, and such mercilessness ensured that very few openly rebelled against the Stalinist regime. Not only this, but the Zhdanovschina, a cultural purge, ensured that only Stalinist-conforming literary works, news articles, and various forms of the arts were available to the Soviet public, preventing any significant literary opposition from arising. Prominent figures such as Shostakovitch, Dostoevsky, and Pasternak were prevented from publishing much of their work, deemed to be critical of the regime. Such censorship meant that very little formal, organised, public opposition arose during post-1941. This was aided substantially by the effects of the Cult of Personality that surrounded Stalin - his 75th birthday celebrations, the renaming of Leningrad to Stalingrad, and the publication of a biography proclaiming him to be the true successor of Lenin all helped to convince the public and would-be dissidents that here was a man who was the rightful leader of Russia, an all-powerful autocrat who would not be brought down by coup or otherwise. This conviction prevented many fro
