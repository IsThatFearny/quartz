‘Opposition from within the Communist Party posed a greater threat to Soviet leaders than that from opponents and cultural dissidents outside it.’
Assess the validity of this view of the years 1941 to 1964.
```

Both Stalin and Khrushchev faced opposition from both the general population of the Soviet Union and within the Communist party. This essay shall argue that the view that opposition from within the Communist party was a greater threat to the Soviet Leadership than external dissent is valid, largely because those within the party and close to the leadership were best placed to threaten Stalin and Khrushchev's power. This shall be concluded by evaluating how much of a threat external opposition was to each leader when contrasted with internal party opposition.

External opposition to Stalin existed, but was not only relatively limited, but was suppressed rapidly and ruthlessly. Stalin’s purges of ordinary citizens ensured that regular people lived in fear of being accused of being an ‘enemy of the state’ and deported, which prevented significant opposition from arising. Those who did dare to rebel were quickly arrested and subsequently deported, or more likely executed. The NKVD was an efficient machine, which was able to operate an effective police state within Russia. Stalin’s policy of punishing even minor dissent (such as the law which allowed for a maximum sentence of 10 years for a peasant caught stealing an ear of corn from a collective farm) is demonstrative of this, and such mercilessness ensured that very few openly rebelled against the Stalinist regime. Not only this, but the Zhdanovschina, a cultural purge, ensured that only Stalinist-conforming literary works, news articles, and various forms of the arts were available to the Soviet public, preventing any significant literary opposition from arising. Prominent figures such as Shostakovitch, Dostoevsky, and Pasternak were prevented from publishing much of their work, deemed to be critical of the regime. Such censorship meant that very little formal, organised, public opposition arose during post-1941. This was aided substantially by the effects of the Cult of Personality that surrounded Stalin - his 75th birthday celebrations, the renaming of Leningrad to Stalingrad, and the publication of a biography proclaiming him to be the true successor of Lenin all helped to convince the public and would-be dissidents that here was a man who was the rightful leader of Russia, an all-powerful autocrat who would not be brought down by coup or otherwise. This conviction prevented many from speaking or acting out, and thus further limited external opposition. Such lack of public outcry, however, does not necessarily mean that opposition to the Stalinist regime did not exist: in fact, it often came from those who were inextricably entangled within the regime itself.

Despite a lack of external opposition to the Stalinist regime, opposition existed to a much greater extent from within the party - however, whether it was a threat to Stalin’s power is a matter of debate. Take, for example, the Leningrad affair in 1949. The Leningrad party was beginning to gain autonomy, criticising Stalinist policies and straying from the regime - they were also known to be associates of Zhdanov. Although Stalin quickly arrested those involved and executed the leaders of the Leningrad party, this is clear evidence of opposition within the party. Further to this, Malenkov’s criticism of Zhdanov and his cultural purge, a policy which Stalin backed, was seen as opposition to Stalin himself. It is thus clear that opposition within the party existed. However, it never posed much of a threat to Stalin. He dealt with all possible instances of opposition swiftly, by politically manoeuvring himself to stand against any threats - when Molotov fell out of favour, Stalin’s distaste of him was made evident, and Molotov was quickly demoted and shunned by most other members of the Communist party’s higher echelons. The Leningrad Affair was quickly put down, and the perceived opposition of Beria was eliminated in the Mingrelian case, a purge of Beria’s Georgian supporters. The speed and ruthlessness with which Stalin dealt with opposition meant that there was very little threat to him personally, nor was their any threat to his regime as a whole. However, this was a slightly different narrative in the post-Stalinist era.

Outside of the party, Khrushchev was popular. He was seen as a man of the people, a pragmatist rather than a devoted ideologist. His pet-project of agriculture helped his image significantly, as did his condemnation of Stalinism in his Secret Speech at the 20th party congress. However, with his relaxation of censorship and policy of destalinisation, there is much more evidence of dissent towards his regime than could be observed under Stalin: writers were now free to criticise the government to an extent. There is also substantial evidence of particularly scathing criticisms within the arts being published under the radar, through *tamizdat* and *samizdat*. However, Khrushchev’s quick re-tightening of censorship when he realised the criticism that existed within the Soviet Union meant that this was never much of a threat. Within the party, especially immediately after the death of Stalin, there was much opposition to Khrushchev’s regime in the party. Beria was one such dissident. When Stalin died, Beria instantly went to his office and ransacked his documents and his safe, in a clear attempt to find damning evidence against his competitors for the leadership of the Soviet Union. Beria remained opposed to Khrushchev whilst succession was being contested, and when a shared-power scenario evolved. This is clear evidence of opposition to Khrushchev within the party - although Beria was eventually executed after being accused of crimes from all parties. Malenkov and Molotov were on Khrushchev’s side throughout this, but soon turned against him when they realised that he was breaking away from their power-sharing agreement, another clear example of internal opposition to Khrushchev’s regime. However, similarly to Stalin, Khrushchev was a smooth political operator, and a ruthless and merciless one at that - his plot to have Beria executed is a prime example of this, as was his rapid change of position to undermine the legitimacy of Molotov and Malenkov when they turned against him. Such ability to remove opposition, however, slight, meant that internal dissent was never a substantial threat to his power.

In conclusion, despite the existence of opposition in most quarters, both public and within the party, the ability of the Soviet leaders to remove said opposition at well through a combination of violence and slick political manoeuvring meant that there was never any significant threat to Stalinism nor the Khrushchev regime. Despite this, there was certainly more of a threat, if any, coming from within the party than out. Thus, it may be concluded that the view that opposition from within the Communist Party posed a greater threat to Soviet leaders than that from opponents and cultural dissidents outside it is entirely valid.
