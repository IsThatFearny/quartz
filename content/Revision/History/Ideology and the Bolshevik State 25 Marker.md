# Ideology and the Bolshevik State 25 Marker


### How important was ideology in the development of the Bolshevik state, 1917-1929?

</br>

**LOE 1:** Political events were largely driven by ideology

- Decrees on Land and Workers control were ideologically sound (dictatorship of the proletariat, equal distribution of land, etc.)
- Vanguardism (during the revolution) stemmed from Marxist-Leninist ideology
- 

**LOE 2:** Political events were largely driven by pragmatism

- Dissolution of the constituent assembly was motivated by Lenin’s desire to eliminate opposition (even more right-wing socialist opposition)
- Lenin’s testament on the leadership succession was largely pragmatic - only partly considered whether the individual was true to the ideology of the party, mainly taking into account leadership skills and temperament
- ‘Socialism in one country’ (official Bolshevik policy) was decided upon to maintain socialism in Russia, and avoid diverting resources to countries such as Germany (believed to be on the verge of revolution). Did not follow ideology (although Marx never mentioned this in his literature)
- 1921 Ban on Factions shows Lenin’s need for elimination of opposition - against Marxist ideology


**LOE 3:** Economic development was spurred by a pragmatic response from Bolshevik leadership

- NEP diverted from Marxist ideology, introducing ‘state capitalism’ and growing the middle class (rather than growing the working class, which would have been ideologically fitting)
