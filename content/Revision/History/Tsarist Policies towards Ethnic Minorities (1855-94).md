# Tsarist Policies towards Ethnic Minorities (1855-94)

</br>

### How effective were Tsarist policies towards ethnic minorities and Jews in strengthening the Russian Empire in the years 1855-1894?

#### The Question

**Key Words:** ‘strengthening the Russian Empire’; ‘effective’; ‘ethnic minorities and Jews’; ‘1855-1894’

**Context:**

- Rise of nationalism caused by the unification of Italy (1821-70) and Germany (1870-71); 
- Importance of the strong nation-state following Napoleon’s conquest
- Difficulty in uniting Russia due to large geographical area and multitudinous cultural differences

#### Useful info

**Alexander II:**
- Polish rebellion 1963, over 200,000 Poles involved. Tsar acted quickly and crushed the rebellion in 1964, sending his own brother to deal with the rebels.
- No systematic persecution of minorities under Alexander II, using concessions to placate nationalists, e.g. Latvians and Estonians allowed to convert to Lutheranism in 1864 and 1875 respectively, and allowed Finns to have their own parliament
- Towards the end of Alexander II’s reign, conservative attitudes in government led to restrictions such as the prohibition of the Ukrainian language in publications/performances in 1876
- Jews confined to the Pale of Settlement
- Polish revolt frightened Alexander II into reducing the participation of jews in local government

**Alexander III:**
- Alexander III introduced a policy of ‘cultural russification’, to unite the people’s of Russia into one national identity.
- Finnish parliament (*diet*) reorganised to weaken political influence
- Use of the Russian language increasingly demanded
- Independent postal service abolished
- Russian coinage replaced local currency
- Polish national bank closed in 1885
- Polish schools and universities were made to teach in Russian
- Russian enforced in Baltic Germany in all state offices, schools, and the judicial system
- Conscripts from nationalist areas dispersed to prevent national groupings in the military
- Uprisings suppressed in Georgia in 1892, Bashkira in 1884, Uzbekistan and Armenia in 1886, and at Tashkent in 1892
- Adherence to Russian orthodox church encouraged everywhere; legislation favoured orthodoxy; forced mass baptisms introduced
- Inflammatory, anti-semitic slogans introduced (e.g. ‘Beat the Yids - Save Russia’)
- Ministers suggested of Jews that ‘one third emigrate, one third die, and one third assimilate’
- Alexander III personally anti-semitic as a result of religious convictions
- Jewish pogroms occurred in 1881-84, in which Jews were persecuted - their property and business destroyed and burnt, and many instances of rape and murder inflicted upon them
- May laws of 1882 discriminated further against jews - prevented from settling outside cities and towns of fewer than ten thousand people; mortgages made void; and jews forbidden to do businesses on Sundays and Christian holidays
- Admittance of jews to universities regulated by quotas
- Jews no longer allowed to sell alcohol
- Jews had to have the express permission of the minister of justice to take the bar

#### Lines of Enquiry

**LOE 1:** Ethnic Minorities

- Repression of ethnic minorities (e.g. 1863 Polish Revolt, Georgia, etc.) prevented splits in the geography of the Russian empire
- Concessions allowed unity (allowed Latvians and Estonians to convert to Lutheranism)
- This came with some caveats - Finnish being allowed their own parliament (*diet*) strengthened nationalism and devolved power from central government
- However, limitations were largely reversed by Alexander III: *diet* reorganised to weaken influence, Polish state bank closed in 1885, etc.
- Use of Russian as a language aided unity somewhat, although also strengthened nationalism and ‘secret’ use of national languages
- Conscripts were dispersed to different areas to prevent nationalist sections forming in the military

Overall, policies were generally effective when taken over the whole time period - concessions which fuelled nationalism made by Alexander II were reversed by Alexander III.

**LOE 2:** Jews

- Under Alexander II, Jews confined to the pale of settlement (although this was a remnant of Nicholas I’s reign).
- Alexander II not personally anti-semitic, but the Polish revolt of 1863 frightened him into reducing Jewish participation in local government
- Jews did not pose much of a threat to disunity of the empire
- Alexander III was anti-semitic as a result of his religious convictions (believed that they were responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus)
- Introduced a series of laws which gradually restricted the rights of Jews
- Demonisation of Jews (e.g. the slogan ‘beat the yids - save Russia’) created animosity towards them
- Anti-semitism manifested in semi-official Jewish pogroms, symbolising unity against a ‘common enemy’

**LOE 3:** Opposition
