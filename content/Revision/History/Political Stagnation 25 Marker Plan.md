# Political Stagnation 25 Marker Plan


</br>

> [!question]

> ‘The years 1941 to 1964 were a time of political stagnation in the USSR’. Assess the validity of this view.

**Argument:** Little political progress during the Stalinist era, but Khrushchev’s process of destalinisation shows that the latter half of the period was characterised by reforms, despite some limitations.

#### LOE 1: The Stalinist era was a time of political stagnation

- Stalin’s purges continued in a uniform manner, soon becoming a part of life
- Very little progress made in politics - socialism could not be moved past because the power of the state was too strong
- Tight censorship controls and the enforcement of socialist realism (including the Zhdanovschina) prevented any political opposition, internally or externally, from arising
- NKVD under Yezhov and Beria strictly regimented and highly effective
- Order 227 - “Not one step backwards” - showed no relenting in Stalin’s wartime methodology

</br>

#### LOE 2: The Stalinist wartime era was a time of political change

- During the war, Stalin was forced to make concessions in his authority in order to preserve his power in the long-term
- Stalin made the military more autonomous, giving generals more power to make their own decisions
- Belief in the communist system was strengthened - 3.6 new members and 5 million candidate members joined the party - 50% of the military were members of the communist party by the end of the war
- Nationalism on the rise - many nationalist areas collaborated with the invading Germans

**BUT**

- Most of these changes were rolled back after the war
- Zhukov and other officials demoted - Zhukov sent to a smaller post in Odessa
- Military command regained
- Nationalism still suppressed

</br>

#### LOE 3: The Khrushchev era was a time of political stagnation

- Khrushchev maintained the one party communist state
- Force used to suppress rebellious politicians and groups
- Power was not delegated once Khrushchev had gained it, despite calls for collective leadership

</br>

#### LOE 4: The Khrushchev era was *not* a time of political stagnation (reforms and destalinisation)

- Secret speech: condemnation of Stalinist purges and methodology, as well as the cult of personality
- Political prisoners released (617,000 rehabilitated), censorship relaxed, cult of personality stripped away
- Communist party had popular support, now more accountable to its membership
- Democratisation and decentralisation of the party occurred - power was devolved to rural and urban regional authorities in 1962.
- Secret police reduced in size
- Revival of an independent judiciary demonstrates decentralisation of power from the government

#### Conclusion

The view is partially valid. There was little political change during the Stalinist era, and any change that came about as a result of the war was quickly reverted to its per-war state. However, there is substantial evidence that Khrushchev’s destalinisation and democratisation process changed much in Russia, despite limitations to this. It can therefore be concluded that the view is valid for the latter half of the period under Khrushchev, but does not hold true in the Stalinist era.
