# Paper 1 (June 2018)


> **Extract A**

> Visitors to the Russian empire before the First World War returned with similar accounts. Critics and admirers reported that the regime in St Petersburg had an undiminished capacity for oppression. Russian society, in their estimation, was changeless. Peasantry and workers were ‘dark masses’. The universal level of their living conditions, low for centuries, had recently been forced down further by heavy direct taxation. Modernisation remained slight. The Russian imperial state was uniformly reactionary. It acted exclusively in its own interests and was unresponsive to pressure by any social class. The possibility that the discontent might turn into political opposition was the government’s nightmare in the late nineteenth century. Yet repression did not work well enough for the government. After 1905 the monarchy’s power as shrinking. ‘Autocratic Russia’ was no longer run autocratically. The base of support became gravely narrow and events abroad superimposed themselves on St Petersburg’s political disarray. Once the fateful entry into the war had been undertaken, the point of political explosion moved nearer.

> In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, social and economic change undermined the traditional power base of the autocracy. While the influence of the government’s traditional supporters amongst the nobility declined, that of newer groups, such as the intelligentsia and the merchantry, increased. Despite concessions in 1905, the tsarist government was soon firmly back in charge, but long-term survival required great political skill and flexibility and Nicholas’ government lacked both qualities. Nicholas himself was blind to the problems facing his government and rejected all thought of concessions. The decade from 1907 to 1917 offered the tsarist government a last chance to avoid revolution; but by February 1917 Nicholas had alienated the only groups in the empire who might have been able to rescue him. In doing so, he had prevented the emergence of a stable bourgeois government. His failures as a politician help explain why, when the revolution finally came in 1917, it swept away not only the autocratic government, but the whole traditional ruling group in Russia.

> The upheavals of 1905–06 transformed Russia from an absolutist to a constitutional monarchy. The political changes of 1905–06 did not amount to a ‘false constitutionalism’. There occurred, after 1907, a process of stabilisation, as the gulf between government and society, prominent in the 19th century, was finally being bridged. The powers of the Tsar were restricted. The civil freedoms enshrined in the Fundamental Laws marked a definite advance. The very existence of a state Duma created the possibility of a fundamental shift by non-revolutionary means. But war strained the structures of constitutional monarchy to breaking point. Rising economic and political disaffection ran so deep in the cities by the start of 1917, that any sudden interruption to food supplies threatened to trigger an uncontrollable explosion of mass discontent. However, if the impact of the Great War is discounted, there was evidence of progress. The monarchy was in no immediate danger at home in the summer of 1914.

The main argument of Extract A is that Tsarist political authority was weakened after 1905 due to widespread discontent. This argument is supported by the statement that “After 1905 the monarchy’s power was shrinking”. I find this argument to be largely convincing. ‘Bloody Sunday’ in 1905 was the first major display of discontent aimed directly at the Tsar. Father Gapon and the crowds assembled in St. Petersburg demanded steps towards a constitutional monarchy, the creation of a representative assembly, and the extension of civil rights. Previously tough in the face of opposition, in 1906 the Tsar bowed to these demands, conceding the creation of the Duma and an expansion of voting rights and various other civil rights. After this first outcry, the next decade saw various other protests and outbursts, especially by those from the lower classes: the Lena Goldfields massacre in 1912 is one such example. The Tsarist government still used the threat and delivery of violence, but this became an increasingly ineffective method of control. This disorder demonstrates a clear loss of control by the Tsarist government, and makes the argument thoroughly convincing. It might be argued that the Tsar still exercised significant political control: he held the power to dissolve the Duma at will, and was able to influence elections to the body. The first two dumas were dissolved within about 100 days of their formation, due to their anti-tsarist stances, and replaced with a third Duma, nicknamed ‘Lords and Lackeys’, denoting how the Tsar had replaced left-wing dissidents with his own supporters to maintain legitimacy. This makes the argument slightly less convincing, but it remains mostly convincing: the demonstrations and disorder that took place post-1905 demonstrates the Tsarist regime’s weakening grip on power.

The subsidiary argument of Extract A is that the war was the catalyst for the downfall of the Tsarist regime. This argument is supported by the statement that “Once fateful entry into the war had been undertaken, the point of political explosion moved nearer”, and I find this argument to be thoroughly convincing. The damages done to the country by the war caused increasing discontent amongst the population - the Brusilov Offensive in June 1916 saw heavy casualties, and despite being victorious, this caused mass public unrest and disillusionment with the government and the Tsarist regime. This is already convincing evidence, but we can go further: the decision of the Tsar to take personal control of the army led to two significant factors in his eventual fall from grace. Firstly, he was able to be personally blamed for any military failures (such as the Brusilov Offensive); and his leaving Alexandra, his wife, in Petersburg left her susceptible to accusations of being in a relationship with Rasputin. Both of these consequences caused the Tsarist regime to be substantially weakened, and unable to exercise the authority that they had previously commanded, perhaps indirectly leading to the Tsar’s forced abdication in 1917. On the whole, this argument is entirely convincing, because it can clearly be seen that the consequences of Russia’s entry into the war directly led to the weakening of Tsarist political authority.

In conclusion, the two arguments in this extract are largely convincing. The main argument has a single caveat, which can be overcome by other, more significant, elements of the argument, and the subsidiary argument has overwhelming evidence in its favour. On the whole, the extract is substantially convincing.

The main argument of Extract B is that it was Nicholas II’s lack of political skill that led to the destruction of autocracy and his loss of political authority. This argument is supported by the statement that “His [Nicholas II’s] failures as a politician help explain why… [the 1917 revolution] swept away not only the autocratic government, but the whole traditional ruling group in Russia”. I find this extract to be mostly convincing. The extract states that “Nicholas himself was blind to the problems facing his government”. This is certainly accurate - Nicholas II is known to have dismissed the thought of constitutional monarchy or any kind of concessions as “nonsense”, amongst other things. He strongly believed that autocracy would pull through any political crisis. His taking charge of the army in 1916 demonstrates this issue clearly - his decision was made out of the delusion that the Russian people would see him as a hero, rather than as a fool. Nicholas II’s myopia towards the maintenance of the Tsarist regime was a major reason for his eventual loss of power. This evidence makes the argument substantially more convincing. However, we may object that the argument is made less convincing by a clear contradiction: the extract states that “Nicholas… rejected all thought of concessions”. This is wholly inaccurate - concessions were not only made in 1906 (including expanded civil rights and a representative assembly) as a response to the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1905, but were also made throughout his reign to nationalist groups in an attempt to prevent uprisings. This is a limitation, and makes the argument less convincing; however it is not as limiting as it seems, because a rigid regime of repression remained the Tsarist government’s main tool in maintaining power. Thus, we may conclude that the main argument of Extract B is mostly convincing, if not wholly so.

The subsidiary argument of Extract B is that the power base of Tsarist political authority was undermined by the rise of the intelligentsia and other middle classes. This argument is supported by the statement that “While the influence of the government’s traditional supporters amongst the nobility declined, that of newer groups, such as the intelligentsia and the merchantry, increased”. I find this argument to be partially convincing. The growth of the middle classes did pose a challenge to Tsarism - groups such as the Tchaikovsky circle sprang up, demonstrating political opposition. The intelligentsia were the driving force behind various revolutionary groups, such as the People’s Will (the group responsible for assassinating Alexander II in 1881) and the group that assassinated Stolypin in 1911. This makes the argument convincing, however, there is also evidence that contradicts the argument. It can be argued that the nobility maintained significant status and influence - they made up the majority of the Third Duma (1907-1912), and controlled local government almost entirely. Thus, the argument is only partially convincing, as the influence of the nobility remained relatively constant, although the influence of the middle classes did increase.

In conclusion, whilst the main argument is mostly convincing, the fact that the subsidiary argument is only partially convincing limits the extract as a whole. The extract can therefore only be said to be partially convincing.

The main argument of Extract C is that Russia had transformed from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy by 1917. This argument is supported by the statement that “The upheavals of 1905–06 transformed Russia from an absolutist to a constitutional monarchy”. However, this argument is entirely unconvincing. Whilst it is true that the Duma formed the basis of what could have become a constitutional monarchy, the autocracy never achieved this. The third duma, comprised of ‘Lords and Lackeys’ ensured that the Tsar maintained absolute political authority over his government, because those representatives who would have made the monarchy constitutional were instead complicit in maintaining its authority. The Duma still effectively existed as an advisory body. Furthermore, the Tsar’s ability to take command of the army, dissolve the duma, and government appointments had all the hallmarks of absolute power. This makes the argument wholly unconvincing. 

The subsidiary argument of Extract C is that there was little opposition to Tsarist political authority by 1914. This argument is supported by the statement that “the monarchy was in no immediate danger at home in the summer of 1914”. However, again, this argument is mostly unconvincing. The recent assassination (1911) of Stolypin demonstrates extreme discontent with the regime, as do events such as the Lena Goldfields strike. Revolutionary groups such as the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were highly active, as were smaller think-tank-esque groups who challenged the regime. This is contradictory evidence, and so makes the argument substantially less convincing. However, it can be argued that Tsarist regime was in no *practical* danger in 1914 - the aforementioned revolutionary groups had little practical power: Lenin was in exile, with many Bolsheviks in prison. Whilst there were unique incidents, few were orchestrated by large organisations, and none commanded enough power to carry out a revolution, or even a coup. Still, there was at least ideological opposition to the regime, which can be argued to be equally important to practical opposition. Thus, the argument remains unconvincing.

In conclusion, the extract as a whole is very largely unconvincing. The only redeeming factor is that there was little practical opposition that threatened to destabilise the Tsarist regime. Aside from this, all the evidence points to a contrary argument on both counts.
