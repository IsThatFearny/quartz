> Visitors to the Russian empire before the First World War returned with similar accounts. Critics and admirers reported that the regime in St Petersburg had an undiminished capacity for oppression. Russian society, in their estimation, was changeless. Peasantry and workers were ‘dark masses’. The universal level of their living conditions, low for centuries, had recently been forced down further by heavy direct taxation. Modernisation remained slight. The Russian imperial state was uniformly reactionary. It acted exclusively in its own interests and was unresponsive to pressure by any social class. The possibility that the discontent might turn into political opposition was the government’s nightmare in the late nineteenth century. Yet repression did not work well enough for the government. After 1905 the monarchy’s power as shrinking. ‘Autocratic Russia’ was no longer run autocratically. The base of support became gravely narrow and events abroad superimposed themselves on St Petersburg’s political disarray. Once the fateful entry into the war had been undertaken, the point of political explosion moved nearer.

> In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, social and economic change undermined the traditional power base of the autocracy. While the influence of the government’s traditional supporters amongst the nobility declined, that of newer groups, such as the intelligentsia and the merchantry, increased. Despite concessions in 1905, the tsarist government was soon firmly back in charge, but long-term survival required great political skill and flexibility and Nicholas’ government lacked both qualities. Nicholas himself was blind to the problems facing his government and rejected all thought of concessions. The decade from 1907 to 1917 offered the tsarist government a last chance to avoid revolution; but by February 1917 Nicholas had alienated the only groups in the empire who might have been able to rescue him. In doing so, he had prevented the emergence of a stable bourgeois government. His failures as a politician help explain why, when the revolution finally came in 1917, it swept away not only the autocratic government, but the whole traditional ruling group in Russia.

> The upheavals of 1905–06 transformed Russia from an absolutist to a constitutional monarchy. The political changes of 1905–06 did not amount to a ‘false constitutionalism’. There occurred, after 1907, a process of stabilisation, as the gulf between government and society, prominent in the 19th century, was finally being bridged. The powers of the Tsar were restricted. The civil freedoms enshrined in the Fundamental Laws marked a definite advance. The very existence of a state Duma created the possibility of a fundamental shift by non-revolutionary means. But war strained the structures of constitutional monarchy to breaking point. Rising economic and political disaffection ran so deep in the cities by the start of 1917, that any sudden interruption to food supplies threatened to trigger an uncontrollable explosion of mass discontent. However, if the impact of the Great War is discounted, there was evidence of progress. The monarchy was in no immediate danger at home in the summer of 1914.

The main argument of Extract A is that Tsarist political authority was weakened after 1905 due to widespread discontent. This argument is supported by the statement that “After 1905 the monarchy’s power was shrinking”. I find this argument to be largely convincing. ‘Bloody Sunday’ in 1905 was the first major display of discontent aimed directly at the Tsar. Father Gapon and the crowds assembled in St. Petersburg demanded steps towards a constitutional monarchy, the creation of a representative assembly, and the extension of civil rights. Previously tough in the face of opposition, in 1906 the Tsar bowed to these demands, conceding the creation of the Duma and an expansion of voting rights and various other civil rights. After this first outcry, the next decade saw various other protests and outbursts, especially by those from the lower classes: the Lena Goldfields massacre in 1912 is one such example. The Tsarist government still used the threat and delivery of violence, but this became an increasingly ineffective method of control. This disorder demonstrates a clear loss of control by the Tsarist government, and makes the argument thoroughly convincing. It might be argued that the Tsar still exercised significant political control: he was able to
