### ‘The transformation of Russian industry, in the years 1917 to 1941, was achieved through the application of socialist/Marxist principles.’ ATVOTV

Through a series of industrial and economic reforms, in the period 1917-41 Russian industry was wholly transformed. However, the view that this was achieved through the application of socialist and Marxist principles is dubious. In fact, there is substantial evidence to suggest that their application hindered industrial growth. This essay shall explore whether Lenin’s industrial achievements were achieved through these means; ditto Stalin; and also whether application of Marxist principles was a hinderance rather than a help.

Lenin’s form of socialism was certainly applied throughout his time in power, but this application did not necessarily lead to industrial transformation, and we can question to what extent Marxism-Leninism was a bastardisation of a purer form of Marxism. The NEP is a good example of this. The promotion of private industry and the creation of the role of NEPmen largely aided Russia’s industrial transformation, with the ever-expanding middle class taking ownership of the factories and industrial capital. Whilst Lenin argued that the NEP the final stage of capitalism before a transition to full socialism, we can argue that a mixed economy is somewhat untrue to Marxist principles - there is no such example in Marx’s theory. So, whilst the NEP did significantly contribute to the transformation of Russian industry, we cannot conclusively say that it was a purely Marxist programme. We can apply similar logic to much of Lenin’s policy. In the case of other policy, such as the Decree on Workers Control, it can be argued that, whilst certainly socialist, these policies did not have the intended effect on industry, and did not contribute as significantly to the transformation of Russian industry as hoped. The Decree on Workers Control was ideologically sound, staying true to one of the tenets of Socialism, but its effect was little: workers simply did not have the necessary skills to manage factories, often giving themselves disproportionate pay rises, and failing to effectively specialise and manage. Indeed, managers and specialist workers were re-introduced into the workplace to remedy this, a direct contravention of Marxist ideology. Thus, it can be clearly shown that not only were many Leninist-era policies unaligned with Marxism and socialism, but even when they were, they often failed. We can conclude that Lenin’s contribution to the transformation of Russian industry from 1917-1924 was not as a result of the application of Marxist and socialist principles.

Stalin’s economic policy can be questioned as to whether it was successful. A commonality between all three Five Year Plans up until 1941 was an emphasis on developing heavy industry. This certainly reflected Marxist principles, and this policy was largely successful: the First Five Year Plan (1928-32) caused the output of coal and iron to double, and that of steel to increase by ⅓. In this case, it can be argued that Stalin’s policy was both Marxist, and contributed to the transformation of Russian industry, despite not meeting the original aims to the plan. However, other Stalinist-era policies, whilst still socialist, were far less successful. Collectivisation, intended to produce more food supplies for factories, was a disaster for Stalin. After a forced return to voluntary collectivisation (caused by peasant uprisings), by the end of 1930, only 20% of households were still collectivised, having fallen from 58% in March 1930. Despite being Marxist in principle, this policy failed to have any immediate effect on Russian industrial growth. Dekulakisation, another inherently socialist policy (socialism advocated the abolition  of class), was also a failure - circa. 10m million Kulaks were removed from their land, which was effectively a removal of millions of the most prosperous peasants and the highest contributors. This was a major failure for Stalin. It can be clearly concluded that, whilst Stalin’s policies were not necessarily un-socialist, they did not contribute to the transformation of Russian industry (aside from the effects of the three Five Year Plans.)

Where Marxist principles were applied, they often hindered economic and industrial progress. War Communism is a prime example of this. Whilst nationalisation, grain requisitioning, and a state monopoly were all very socialist ideas, whether they succeeded is questionable. Russia’s industrial capacity was damaged to such an extent that it would not return to pre-war levels until 1935, having lost over 20 million tons of production from 1913-1921, and this was largely as a result of war communism. As well as this, the aforementioned Decree on Worker’s Control not only failed, but was a step backwards in industrial productivity. In the Stalinist Era, despite the Five Year Plans seeing some success, collectivisation was another step backward, as agricultural productivity was hindered substantially. As well as this, 25-30% of livestock were slaughtered to prevent their owners being branded ‘kulaks’ and deported or executed, which further damaged agricultural output. This caused food shortages, and directly led to a loss in the trend rate of industrial growth. Socialist policies were often more of a hinderance than a help, and there are many such examples which provide evidence against the view that industrial transformation was achieved through socialist and Marxist principles.

In conclusion, many policies from 1917-41 were not entirely socialist, and if they were, then they saw varying levels of success. Overall, when Marxist principles were applied, they were not responsible for the transformation of Russian industry, even if they saw small amounts of success. Therefore we may conclude that the view that the transformation of Russian industry from 1917-41 was not achieved due to the application of Marxist principles.
