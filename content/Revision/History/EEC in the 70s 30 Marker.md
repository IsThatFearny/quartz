## Assess the value of these source to a historian studying attitudes to the EEC in the 1970s


The purpose of this source is to emphasise the Conservative Party’s commitment to staying in the EEC, whilst also condemning the left-wing anti-European stance. This purpose is highly valuable to the historian studying attitudes to the EEC in the 1970s, because it clearly highlights the political polarisation surrounding the EEC: Thatcher, the leader of the Conservative Party, is quite clearly in favour of remaining in the EEC, whereas Michael Foot and Tony Benn are condemned as wanting to take Britain out of it. Whilst this division was not down party lines (both the hard-left and hard-right wanted to leave the EEC, the former who believed that it would damage the workers, the latter who believed that it was a sacrifice of British sovereignty), the historian is still able to garner an idea of how divisive the topic of the EEC was across the political spectrum. The nature of this source is a speech, and it was made by Margaret Thatcher in 1975. This is of value to the historian, again because it demonstrates how attitudes to the EEC were not split down party lines. Thatcher, as leader of the Conservative Party, gives the party’s support to Wilson’s referendum initiative. After the 1974 election, which they lost, the Tory party moved to the left in an effort to regain the political centre ground. They occupied a similar area to Labour, albeit more right-wing. This shows how the centre-ground was in support of remaining in the EEC, and how the extremes of the political spectrum were against it, demonstrating non-partisan divisions in British politics, which is of significant value to the historian studying attitudes to the EEC in the 1970s. However, the fact that Mrs Thatcher made this speech makes it inherently political - it is likely to have been carefully crafted to be a boon to the Conservative party and a slight to the left. This limits its value somewhat. The intended audience is the British public and the wider conservative party, and this is of value to the historian because it demonstrates that public opinion was widely believed to be in favour of EEC membership (or at least Mrs Thatcher believed it to be so). By reasserting the Conservative Party’s commitment to Europe, Thatcher made a clear attempt at establishing the Conservative Party as the pro-European party, specifically condemning the left by saying that a ‘no’ vote would be construed as a ‘defeat for co-operation between nations… a victory for the left’. Because a party which has recently lost an election generally attempts to regain the centre ground and pursue populist policies, the historian can infer that this was one such policy, and that it was backed by the British public - indeed, the referendum outcome was 67% in favour of remaining in the EEC. The thrust of the extract is that the Conservative Party is a pro-Europe party, and that they want Britain to remain where they ‘belong’. This thrust is supported by the statement that “the Conservative Party has been pursuing the European vision almost as long as we have existed as a party”, and it is largely accurate - after all, it was Heath who finally secured entry to the EEC after numerous failures by the Labour party, most recently in 1967 when entry was vetoed. The thrust adds value for the historian studying attitudes towards the EEC in the 1970s, because it shows how important membership of the EEC was to many in Britain. The willingness to be associated with EEC entry demonstrates this clearly, showing that the population was in favour of membership. This thrust is supported by the tone, which, when referring to Europe, is very enthusiastic, but when referring to a ‘No’ vote, takes on very negative connotations: Thatcher says that “Europe is where we are and where we always have been”, clearly keen to highlight Britain’s commitment to the continent, but subsequently condemns a ‘No’ vote as a “failure for co-operation between nations”. This adds value in a similar way to the thrust, highlighting the attitudes of the British public. In sum, the extract is very valuable to the historian studying attitudes to the EEC in the 1970s, because it illustrates the non-partisan divides in government and across the country in terms of attitudes towards remaining in the European Community.

The purpose of this source is to commit the Labour government to keeping inflation down, in the face of militant Trade Unions pay negotiations. This is of value to the historian studying the reasons for the Conservative victory in the 1979 election because it demonstrates the aims of the Labour party. Having committed the party to keeping down inflation, by stating that “it is the government’s inescapable responsibility to keep down inflation” (a statement which has hints of Monetarism within it), any failure to do so could be easily held against the party as a clear failure in policy. After the Winter of Discontent (1978-79), this very thing occurred. A winter of strikes (starkly exemplified by bodies left unburied after a gravediggers strike), and record-breaking harsh, cold weather, caused inflation to run rampant, and this was seen as a clear failure for Callaghan’s government. This was a major factor in the Conservative victory in the 1979 election, and is thus of significant value to the historian. The nature and purpose of this source also add value: it is a speech made by James Callaghan, the prime minister at the time, in October 1978. At this point, inflation was under 8%, and the economy was relatively healthy. Perhaps most pertinently, Callaghan had only that year imposed a 5% limit on pay increases for public sector workers. This was below inflation, and workers were demanding increases at the rate of inflation, if not higher. In this speech, Callaghan is making an attempt to vindicate his position as a measure to prevent rising inflation. This is of value to the historian because it shows how desperate Callaghan was to show that policy would work, his reason behind this being mounting negative public opinion towards the Labour government, which contributed heavily to the Conservative victory in the 1979 election. This is, however, also a limitation: Callaghan’s desperation to vindicate himself may have led to a speech which was overly optimistic, meaning that the speech may misrepresent his goals and his attitudes towards the Trade Unions and inflation. Nevertheless, the source remains largely valuable. The intended audience of this speech is the Labour Party Conference of 1978. This adds great value to the source, as Callaghan is not playing to an audience of dubious voters, but instead a relatively small group of his supporters. This means that embellishment is perhaps less necessary than if he were publicly speaking, and he can be more honest. However, the opposite may also be true, that Callaghan’s positive review of the Trade Union Movement was intended to play to a Labour audience, and may not truly represent his views or those of his cabinet. The thrust of the source is that, no matter how ‘responsibly’ the Trade Unions negotiate, the government’s main priority must be to keep inflation down. In a similar vein to the purpose, this has significant value to the historian, demonstrating a failed commitment to preventing inflation from rising, shown to be a failure after the Winter of Discontent. The tone supports this: Callaghan is confident in his commitment to keeping down inflation, describing it as ‘the Government’s inescapable responsibility.’ In sum, this source is of significant value to the historian studying the reasons for the Conservative victory in the 1979 election.
