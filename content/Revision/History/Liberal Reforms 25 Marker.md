The 1960s saw a series of reforms which would serve to liberalise legislation and society as a whole. Whilst the argument can be made the Harold Wilson’s Labour government deserves no credit for these reforms, this is a flawed argument, and thus this essay shall argue that Harold Wilson’s government deserves much of the credit for introducing such liberal legislation in the 1960s, exploring why they might deserve less credit as a result of the reforming activity of others, the role of Roy Jenkins in passing reforms, and the liberalising educational reforms. It shall be concluded that the view is wholly invalid.

It must be noted that some of the reforms that were passed in the early years of Harold Wilson’s Labour government were pioneered by the outgoing Tory party. A prime example of this is the Murder Act of 1965. Whilst passed in 1965, and therefore by a Labour government, abolition of the death penalty had been suggested and the basis of the act legislated for in 1957, in the form of the Homicide Act. This was the doing of the Tory party, who would then go on to support the 1965 Act. Similarly, the idea for the decriminalisation of homosexuality which would be introduced by Leo Abse under Wilson was recommended in the 1957 Wolfenden report, in the pre-Wilson era. Furthermore, members of other parties introduced Private Member’s Bills which involved liberal legislation. An example of this is the introduction of the Abortion Act in 1967 by a Liberal MP, David Steel (dubbed the ‘baby of the house’, having been elected at age 29). The liberal party were highly active in supporting and passing these reforms. Whilst these examples support the argument that Harold Wilson’s Labour government deserves no credit for the liberal reforms of the 1960s, it can be objected that in the case of reforms introduced by the Liberal party such as the Abortion Act, their introduction was largely sponsored and enthusiastically supported by the Labour party, and cross-bench support was needed to pass them, which involved gaining the support of a majority of the party. It can also be argued that, in the case of homosexuality, it was Abse and the Labour party who acted on the Wolfenden report: the Tory government had taken no action. Thus, there is no merit in the aforementioned argument, because the Labour party’s support was invaluable.

In support of the argument that Labour deserve credit for the liberal reforms of the 1960s is the significance of the role of Roy Jenkins. Jenkins was the Home Secretary under Wilson, and is known to have been a great influence on the introduction of various reforms. Most liberal reforms were introduced via Private Member’s Bills (PMBs), and this was Jenkins’ doing - he felt that if they were introduced to the house by an individual, rather than as official government policy, then bi-partisan support for the bills would be more likely, an idea which paid off significantly, as many reforms had Tory and Liberal support. Similarly, he ensured that all votes on major ‘issues of conscience’ such as abortion, homosexuality, the death penalty, etc. would be ‘free votes’, meaning that MPs were not at the mercy of the party whips to vote in line with party policy. This legitimised many of the liberal reforms that were passed, and avoided any association with the Labour party, increasing the likelihood of the reforms passing through the house unhindered. Jenkins also gave his support to David Steel in introducing the Abortion Act, and ensured that the majority of the party were favourable to the idea of certain reforms. Marr credits Jenkins with being the most reforming Home Secretary in modern times, and this is by no means undeserved. His role and influence demonstrates clearly that, at the very least, an integral part of the Labour party deserves significant credit for the liberal reforms of the 1960s.

Wilson’s government can also be given significant credit for one of the major liberal reforms of the time - education reform. Wilson’s government abolished the Tripartite system, which had been in place since the start of the century. The sending of circular 10/65 by Anthony Crosland, the Education Secretary, which instructed all Local Education Authorities (LEA) to convert to the comprehensive system, was a pivotal moment in this. It made the education system fairer and allowed those who did not pass the 11+ to still gain a good education, despite their lack of admittance to grammar schools. This was almost entirely the doing of Crosland and his colleagues in the department of education, a major credit to the actions of the Labour party during their time in government. Even more strikingly, perhaps, was the establishment of the Open University. First proposed as a white paper by Nye Bevan’s widow, Wilson proclaimed this to be one of his proudest achievements. The Open University gave a university education to those who would otherwise be unable to gain one, whether because of financial constraints or academic performance. By 1980, the Open University had over 70,000 students enrolled. The reform of the education system was one of the most widespread and important liberal reforms, and Wilson’s government can be argued to be able to take full credit for this reform.

To conclude, it can wholeheartedly be argued that Wilson’s government deserves much credit for the liberal reforms of the 1960s - despite some reforms being due to other parties and individuals, the role of Roy Jenkins and the importance of education reform allow it to be concluded that the view that Harold Wilson’s Labour government deserves no credit for the liberal reforms of the 1960s is entirely invalid.
