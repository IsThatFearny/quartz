> **Extract B: Are energy firms exploiting their market power?**

> The UK energy market was privatised in the early 1990s and is dominated by six firms, British Gas, EDF Energy, E.ON, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE. These firms supply, produce and own energy reserves. Gas is the main source of fuel used by electricity generators. The increase in household fuel bills has been a cause of rising inflation in recent years. In autumn 2013, prices were increasing at three times the rate of inflation. Energy prices have risen faster than average earnings and 6.5 million households were spending over 10% of their incomes on energy and so experiencing ‘fuel poverty’. Are the oligopolistic energy utilities exploiting their monopoly power? Firms raise prices quickly when their wholesale costs increase, but are slow to reduce them when market conditions change. The energy regulator, OFGEM, doesn’t regulate prices or profits, but aims to promote greater competition in the market. OFGEM has found no evidence of collusion between energy suppliers to date. Wholesale energy costs are responsible for around half the final domestic bill. Suppliers buy energy on the wholesale market from energy producers. Contracts are complex and firms buy energy to cover their future needs. A generator may sell energy to a supplier within the same company before it is sold on to the consumer. The determination of wholesale prices and their link to retail prices aren’t clear. UK households faced over 1756 different price plans in early 2013. This makes it difficult for consumers to compare rates and few consumers switch supplier. In 2013 OFGEM intervened to fix the maximum number of price plans to four per firm; this should bring greater price transparency.

> Extract C: Are price rises inevitable?

> Do UK consumers pay too much for energy? Department of Energy & Climate Change research shows domestic electricity prices were fourth lowest and gas prices second lowest in a survey of 15 EU countries. Firms claim profits, averaging a return of 5% in 2012, are not excessive and are used to fund much-needed investment in both infrastructure and future energy supplies. Will Morris, Group Managing Director of SSE, claims many factors are responsible for driving up prices: “Buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers, and government-imposed levies collected through bills all cost more than last year.” Ed Miliband, Leader of the Opposition in the UK, promised that a future Labour government would impose “a price freeze for twenty months because the market is not working”, and that the regulator would make the market more competitive. In the longer term, the UK needs to become less dependent on imported energy and use ‘greener’ sources such as wind, solar and nuclear. One in five UK power stations will be obsolete by 2023 and there is a risk of power shortages in coming years. The Government guarantees high prices to firms producing energy from renewable and nuclear sources but these costs are then passed on to consumers. The Government claims that high guaranteed prices for power generators makes good long-term sense. Gas prices are expected to rise over the longer term, despite the discovery of shale gas in the UK. Could more be done to encourage households to reduce their demand for energy? Energy conservation could result in lower bills but few households are making use of the ‘Green Deal’ scheme to make homes more energy efficient.

Using the data in Extract A, calculate, to two decimal places, the overall percentage change in household bills from 2009 to 2013. [2 marks]
```


$1420 - 1145 = 275$
$\frac{275}{1145} \times 100 = 24.01$

**24.01**% increase

Explain how the data in Extract A shows that energy companies have exploited their market power. [4 marks] 
```

From 2009 to 2013, the amount of profit that firms have taken per bill has risen proportionally higher than costs have rise. The average household bill has risen by 24.01%, whereas the profit taken per bill has risen by 850% from £10 per bill to £95 per bill. Such a large increase, out of line with inflation of energy bills, is clear evidence of exploitation, because firms have been able to raise their prices to increase profit, which causes the costs for households to increase - this is possible because consumers have no other choice in how they supply their energy. Further to this, the fact that the costs of the energy itself makes up just over half of the overall price is another example of how firms are exploiting their power - they are overcharging consumers.

Extract B (lines 11–12) states that there is ‘no evidence of collusion between energy suppliers to date.’ 

With the help of a diagram, explain how collusion between energy suppliers could affect the retail prices paid by consumers. [9 marks]

The energy industry is often oligopolistic, with very few firms involved. This is largely due to high sunk costs and high barriers to entry (only a certain amount of firms have access to the required infrastructure). This may result in collusive behaviour between suppliers, in order to make as much profit as possible. If firms collude, then they are able to raise their prices without sacrificing demand through one firm undercutting another. This means that prices across the industry will increase significantly for all firms involved in the collusive behaviour. The reasons for this can be demonstrated using Game Theory. Assuming the presence of two firms, there are four possible outcomes: 1) Firm A raises prices, Firm B lowers their price. Firm A will lose customers because Firm B is undercutting them in price; 2) Firm B raises prices, Firm A lowers their price. Ditto outcome, vice versa; 3) Both firms lower their prices, resulting in a net loss of profits for both firms; 4) Both firms raise prices, resulting in a net gain of profits for both firms. Without collusion, firms will not raise their prices, because they do not want scenario 1 or 2 to occur. If firms collude, then they are willing to raise prices, because they have an assurance that their competitors will not undercut them, and they will increase their profits. The diagram below demonstrates this: if firms lower their prices without colluding (from P1 to P3), then they will sacrifice proportionally more output, and vice versa with raising prices. If collusion takes place, then the demand curve will lose its kink, and prices will no longer be sticky at P1Q1.

In Extract C, (lines 9–10) Ed Miliband is quoted as saying that a future Labour government would impose “a price freeze for twenty months because the market is not working”. 

Using the data in the extracts and your economic knowledge, assess whether you agree that fixing a maximum price for energy that is sold to households is the best way of dealing with market failure in the UK energy industry? [25 marks]

Due to the naturally oligopolistic nature of the UK energy industry, significant market failure often occurs in the industry, causing the exploitation of consumers and a loss of consumer welfare.
