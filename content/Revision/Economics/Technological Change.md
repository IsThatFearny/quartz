Technological Change ^o1eSKJx6

Invention is the process of creating a new product or a new way to make a product. Innovation
is the act of improving or contributing to existing products.

Technological change can result in improvements in efficiency and productivity, which could lower costs
of production for firms. The quality and quantity of goods and services produced might improve.

Technological change can lead to the development of new products, the development of new markets,
and may destroy existing markets. The process of creative destruction is linked to technological change.

Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are important for creating a competitive market. They
create jobs, stimulate innovation and investment and promote a competitive environment.

Creative destruction is the idea that new entrepreneurs are innovative, which challenges existing firms.
The more productive firms then grow, whilst the least productive are forced to leave the market.
This results in an expansion of the economy's productive potential. ^CVxVTjOK

Monopolies do not have an incentive to innovate, since they have no competition. This means they are
often inefficient and their costs are higher than they could be. Oligopolies tend to have more of an
incentive to innovate, since they are earning supernormal profits and are trying to get ahead of their
competitors. This means that technological change is quite fast in oligopolies. ^wMQMJ4g4
