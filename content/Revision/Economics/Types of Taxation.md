Types of Taxation ^aB3mpzjM

Direct Taxes are imposed and are paid directly to the government from the tax-payer. Examples
include income tax, corporation tax, NICs and inheritance tax. Consumers and firms are responsible
for paying the whole tax to the government. Indirect taxes are imposed on expenditure on goods
and services, and they increase production costs for producers. This increase market price and
demand contracts.

There are two types of indirect taxes:

- Ad Valorem taxes are percentages, such as VAT, which adds 20% of the unit price. This is the
  main indirect tax in the UK.

- Specific taxes are a set tax per unit, such as 58p per litre fuel duty on unleaded petrol.

Direct and Indirect Taxes ^nqjHFDkY

Proportional, progressive, and regressive taxes ^fwpbGrgW

A proportional tax has a fixed rate for all tax payers, regardless of income. It is also called a
flat tax. The incidence of taxes is equal, regardless of the ability of the taxpayer to pay. It
could encourage people to earn higher incomes, because the rate of tax paid does not increase.


A progressive tax has an increase in the average rate of tax as income increases. As income
increases, the proportion of income taxed increases. An example of this is the UK tax bracket
system. This should help to reduce inequality, because those on lower incomes pay less tax. The
tax is based on the payer's ability to pay. Higher income households are more able to pay higher
rates of tax than lower income households. Generally, direct taxes are more progressive.

A regressive tax does not relate to income, but means those on lowest incomes have a higher 
average rate of tax. In other words, the proportion of income paid as tax is higher for those 
on lower incomes than those on higher incomes. For example, as a percentage of income, the London 
Congestion Charge and Council Taxes are higher for those on lower incomes. This leads to a less 
equitable distribution of income. Generally, indirect taxes are more regressive.  ^koh6kBNp
