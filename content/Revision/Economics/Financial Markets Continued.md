The difference between debt and equity ^rimcyGH0

Debt is money which has been borrowed from a lender, which is usually a bank. There is little flexibility,
and the loan is later repaid with interest.

Equity is a stock or security which represents interest in owning e.g. a firm, a car, or a house. It is
when there is no outstanding debt, such as when a loan for a car or a mortgage has been fully paid
off. The owner's equity is then the car or the house, which can be sold for cash. ^9dWB66Hr

There is an inverse relationship between market interest rates and bond prices. When a bond is bought, 
money is lent to the issuer. The issuer agrees to pay the value of the bond back when it matures, in 
addition to periodic interest payments. The rate of interest is fixed when the bond is issued. 

New bonds have rates close to the market interest rate. If the market interest rate falls, for 
example, the bond would be worth more, since it carries a higher interest rate than current market 
conditions. Similarly, the bond is worth less is the rate increases. This is because the bond has a 
lower interest rate than the current market.

Firms can raise finance by issuing shares, issuing corporate bonds and borrowing from a bank. Raising 
finance through shares is relatively cheap for firms. Although firms are legally obliged to pay their 
shareholders dividends, a proportion of their profits as a reward for investing in them, they only pay
dividends when there are distributable profits and it is voted for by shareholders. 

Borrowing could involve paying back loans with high interest rates, which could be expensive. This might 
be unaffordable for new, smaller firms. However, it is flexible and the funds can be increased or 
decreased by borrowing more or paying back the loan.

Corporate bonds are issued to raise funding for large projects, such as to expand the firm, develop a 
product, move to a new premise, or takeover another firm. Bonds could be traded in a similar way to 
shares, and they are partially protected against variable interest rates or economic changes. However, 
the firm will have to pay the investors who buy the bonds interest. 

In relation to government bonds, the term coupon is an interest payment to the bondholder between the date 
of issue and the date of maturity. Maturity is the period of time for which the financial asset is outstanding. 
When it finishes and has been repaid, it has matured.  ^LgPcQ311
