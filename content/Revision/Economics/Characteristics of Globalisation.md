# Text Elements
Globalisation is the ever increasing integration of the world's local, regional, and national economies into a single,
international market. It involves the trade of goods and services, the free movement of capital and labour and
the free interchange of technology and intellectual capital.

With the spread of globalisation came more trade between nations and more transfers of capital including FDI.
Moreover, brands developed globally and labour has been divided between several countries. There is more migration
and more countries participate in global trade, such as China and India, as well as higher levels of investment.
Additionally, countries have become more interdependent, so the performance of their own country depends on the
performance of their own country depends on the performance of other countries. ^rYNl0vcD
