Why banks fail ^pc3bK27E

There are risks involved with lending long-term and borrowing short-term. Banks might lost money on
investments, and if there are insufficient funds in a vault, banks might not be able to provide
depositors with money when it is demanded. ^793rkeGR

Moral Hazards ^rvGYmlG0

A moral hazard is a situation where there is a risk that the borrower does things that the lender
would not deem desirable, because it makes the borrower less likely to repay a loan. It usually
occurs when there is is some form of insurance for the mistake. Banks might take more risks if they
know the Bank of England or the government can help them if things go wrong. ^FthvyRtX

Systemic risk in financial markets can be seen as a negative externality. Systemic risks are the risk
of damage to the economy or the financial market. For example, it could be the risk of collapse of a
bank. Since this costs firms, consumers, the economy, and the market, it is akin to a negative externality. ^Rx5Xc35k

Systemic Risk ^mdsuAHS2

Liquidity and Capital Ratios ^twykL9AK

A liquidity ratio is used to determine how able a company is to pay off short-term obligations. The higher
the ratio, the greater the safety margin of the bank. When creditors want payment, they look at liquidity
ratios to decide whether the bank is a concern.

A capital ratio is a comparison between the equity capital and the risk-weighted assets of a bank. A bank's
financial strength is determined using this. Assets have different weightings, where physical cash has zero risk
and credit carries more risk.

The recent financial crisis showed how having insufficient finance, in either capital or liquidity, can be dangerous.
Another risk that comes with this is that investors might assume other banks will fail as well, which reduces
confidence. ^niXdxnYy
