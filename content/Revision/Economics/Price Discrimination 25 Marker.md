Price discrimination, i.e. charging different prices for different consumers depending on certain criteria, has multiple benefits to firms and to consumers, but also involves drawbacks. Whilst it can be argued that said drawbacks outweigh the benefits, this essay shall argue otherwise: that the potential benefits for firms and consumers outweigh the risks and harmful elements of price discrimination, because it helps firms drive more business and aids those who need help in paying for certain goods.

Price discrimination is often argued to have a negative effect on the ‘normal’ consumer, i.e. the consumer of median age, median salary, with no extenuating health conditions, etc. This is because, often, these consumers are charged a higher price than those with extenuating circumstances. For example, entry into a theme park will often be more expensive for these consumers than it would be for, say, a child under 12 years old. Some economists argue that this leads to an inequitable distribution of income. However, it can be argued instead that the benefit that this provides to the firm and the consumer that the price discrimination is targeted at outweighs the damage done to the ‘normal’ consumer. Sticking with the example of theme parks, price discrimination in the form of lower prices for young children or families helps these families to afford entry to the theme park, and also, because prices are lower, drives demand for entry to the theme park by this demographic. This will benefit the firm’s profits: if the increase in demand outweighs the sacrifice in price, then the firm will have benefitted overall. The diagram below demonstrates this: a right shift in the demand curve from D1 to D2 as a result of lower prices causes the quantity to increase from Q1 to Q2, which demonstrates the increase in attendees that the theme park will see as a result of price discrimination. As a luxury good, theme park entry is price elastic, and so the decrease in price will cause a much larger increase in quantity demanded. Such an example of price discrimination in regular practise shows that, in this circumstance, the loss to the ‘normal’ consumer is far outweighed by the benefit to the firm and to the consumer that is targeted, and so it can be seen that price discrimination is not always damaging.

Similarly, price discrimination can aid those who need support. Take, for example, rail travel. in the UK, those under 25 and those above 65 are able to buy a railcard, which provides discounted rates. The discounts are justified by the fact that these age groups are more likely to be using public transport or not have the money to consume tickets. This reduction in price will help
