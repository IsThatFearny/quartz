**Financial Markets boost AD and LRAS**

**Majority of the financial sector is private**. This means that money will likely be invested wisely, because there is a profit motive.

**What parts of the financial sector are public?:**

- Central bank - control base rate, are the lender of last resort, provide liquidity
- Regulators
- PRA/FCP

#### Objectives of Commercial banks

- Liquidity
- Security
- Profitability

These are **trade offs** - if a bank wants more liquidity, then they might have to purchase assets that make less profit.

#### Consequences of poor regulation

- Illiquidity
- Lack of profits
- Taking disproportionate risk
- Preventing growth

**But!**

- Can invest in risky ideas (e.g. startups)

#### Bonds

$Bond \ Yield = \frac{Annual \ Coupon}{Market \ Price}$

**Bond market is similar to the stock market** - basic supply and demand regulate bond prices and yields.
