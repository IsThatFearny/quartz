> Explain how the data in Extract A (Figures 1 and 2) show that in 2012 Greece was more likely to have a problem with its national debt than the UK. (4 Marks)

Firstly, Greece’s debt as a percentage of GDP was significantly higher than the UK’s, at 159% compared to the UK’s 84%. This means that it will take longer to pay off the national debt, and the national debt will likely continue to increase at a higher rate than in the UK. Furthermore, the spike in bond yield of Greek government long-term bonds to 22.5% in 2012 shows that people are selling their bonds (there is an inverse relationship between yield and price, and so an increase in the yield correlates with a decrease in the price, caused by the selling of bonds). A likely cause of this is that investors are less confident in the government’s ability to repay the bonds, and so they want to sell risky assets. This shows that Greece may have been perceived to have had a problem with its national debt in 2012, especially when compared to the UK, which had a bond yield of 1.7% in 2012, demonstrating more confidence in the government’s ability to repay debts.

> With the help of a diagram explain how an increase in government spending could affect the national debt. (9 Marks)

The national debt is the cumulative total of every year of government expenditure minus government revenue. Therefore, it follows that an increase in the annual budget deficit will lead to an increase in the national debt. The budget deficit is government spending over the course of a year, minus government tax receipts. If a government increases spending without a corresponding increase in tax revenue, the budget deficit will increase, because the government will have to borrow more money to finance their spending. This increase in government borrowing will lead to an increase in the national debt, because the government is in more debt than the year before. This can be demonstrated on the diagram below:
