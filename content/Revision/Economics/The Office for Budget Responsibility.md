# Text Elements
The Office for Budget Responsibility ^NAAZBj2t

The OBR provides analysis of the UK's finances. They produce 5-year forecasts for the economy,. including
the impact of tax and spending changes announced in the budget. They judge the government's performance
against its fiscal targets. These are to balance the budget 5 years ahead. They assess the likelihood
of the government meeting the targets. They scrutinise tax and welfare spending measures. They also
assess how sustainable public sector finances are in the long run. ^ggTi6dmM
