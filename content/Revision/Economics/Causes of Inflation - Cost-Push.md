Causes of Inflation - Cost-Push ^vbgfZ1TA

This is from the supply side of the economy, and occurs when firms face rising costs. This
occurs when:

- Changes in world commodity prices can affect domestic inflation. For example, raw materials
  might become more expensive if oil prices rise. This increases costs of production.

- Labour becomes more expensive (e.g. through trade unions)

- Expectations of inflation - if consumers expect prices to rise, they may ask for higher wages
  to make up for this, and this could trigger more inflation.

- Indirect taxes could increase the cost of goods such as cigarettes or fuel, if producers
  choose to pass the costs onto the consumer.

- Depreciation in the exchange rate, which causes imports to become more expensive and pushes
  up the price of raw materials.

- Monopolies, using their dominant market position to exploit consumers with high prices ^8ApHiYNq
