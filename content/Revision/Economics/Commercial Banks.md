Commercial Banks ^CYUUg3VQ

A commercial bank manages deposits, cheques, and savings accounts for individuals and firms.
They can make loans using the money saved with them. ^ovOTOJ64

Accept deposits: Commercial banks accept deposits from the public, usually in the form of savings.
Those on low incomes might save a part of their income for security, whilst firms see saving as 
convenient. Banks can meet the different needs of their depositors by providing different accounts.
Depositors could use Demand Deposits, which allow deposits to be made or withdrawn immediately.
This is useful for firms who need to make immediate payments. Alternatively, Fixed Deposits store
money for a long time. They have higher rates of interest, since banks can use these deposits
knowing they will not be withdrawn. Saving Deposits are done by those who withdraw money often,
but not necessarily immediately, and who are generally receiving an income. They have lower rates
of interest than Fixed Deposits.

Provide loans: The main source of income for commercial banks is interest, which banks earn through
providing loans. Banks create credit by using deposited funds as loans. Some loans are secured
against an asset, such as a house. This is to protect the bank's funds if the loan is not re-payed.

Loans could be in the form of crash credit, on demand or only for the short term. Cash credit loans
are based on bonds and approved securities. Banks enter agreements with customers so money can be
withdrawn several times a year. Banks deposit money periodically into the accounts of the customer. 
Loans on demand are when the entire loan is paid into the account of the borrower. Therefore, the 
loan is charged with interest immediately. Short-term loans tend to be personal or for working capital 
and are usually against a security.  ^ttaDoVxh

The Main Functions of Commercial Banks ^tma6sAYk

Overdraft: When a current account has no deposits, consumers can still borrow money from the bank
in the form of an overdraft. These are at a high interest rate and the amount that can be
borrowed is limited.

Investment of funds: Surplus funds could be invested into securities such as government bonds and
treasury bills. These could earn a return for the bank

Agency functions: Banks represent their consumers. For example, they collect cheques and dividends, pay
bills, such as through a direct debit, they deposit interest and income tax, buy and sell securities, and
arrange the transfer of money between places for consumers. ^SOlCjqoH
