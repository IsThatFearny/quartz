Factors influencing PED ^FYwaLAzv

- Necessity: A necessary good, such electricity, will have a relatively inelastic demand.
  Even if the price increases significantly, consumers will still demand electricity because
  they need it. Luxury goods, such as holidays, are more elastic. If the price of flights
  increases, the demand is likely to fall significantly.

- Substitutes: if a good has several substitutes, then the demand is more price elastic
  The elasticity can also change within markets, e.g. white bread vs brown bread. This
  is because there are fewer substitutes for bread in general, but there are several
  substitutes to white bread, hence white bread is more elastic. The closer and more
  available the substitutes are, the more price elastic the demand.

- Addictiveness: The demand for addictive goods is not sensitive to a change in price
  because consumers become addicted to them, and therefore continue to demand even
  if the price increases

- Proportion of income spent: if the good only takes up a smaller proportion of income,
  then demand is likely to be relatively price inelastic. If the good takes up a significant
  proportion of income, the demand is likely to be more price elastic.

- Durability of the good: A good which lasts a long time has a more elastic demand,
  because consumers wait to buy another one

- Peak and off-peak demand: During peak times, the demand for tickets is more
  price-inelastic, e.g. trains ^2up82WVA
