# Text Elements
Total Revenue (TR) is calculated by price x quantity sold. This is the revenue received from the sale of a
given level of output.

Average Revenue (AR) is the average receipt per unit. This is calculated by TR / quantity sold. In other
words, this is the price each unit is sold for.

Marginal Revenue is extra revenue earned from the sale of one extra unit. It is difference between total
revenue at different levels of output. ^rHN1Ok15

Marginal, Average and Total Revenue ^1rSUMPdO

The AR curve is the firm's demand curve. This is because the average revenue curve is the price of the good/
In markets where firms are price takers, the AR curve is horizontal. This shows the perfectly elastic demand
for their goods.

Profit is the difference between between TR and total costs. It is the reward entrepreneurs receive from
taking risks.

When demand is perfectly elastic, marginal revenue = average revenue.

Marginal revenue measures the change in total revenue with respect to changes in the amount of goods and
services sold. Marginal revenue is calculated by the change in total revenue divided by the change in 
quantity sold. ^OjH8o4Wo
