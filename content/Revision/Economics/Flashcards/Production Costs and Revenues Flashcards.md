#### Automation
Automatic control; the process by which machines control other machines
<!--ID: 1711964130955-->

#### Average cost
Total production cost divided by total output (cost per unit of output).
<!--ID: 1711964130959-->

#### Average revenue
Total revenue divided by total output (revenue per unit of output).
<!--ID: 1711964130962-->

#### Capital productivity
Output per unit of capital.
<!--ID: 1711964130966-->

#### Constant returns to scale
When output increases by an equal proportion the increase in
inputs
<!--ID: 1711964130969-->

#### Decreasing returns to scale
When output increases by a smaller proportion than the
increase in inputs
<!--ID: 1711964130973-->

#### Diseconomies of scale
When long-run average costs rise as output rises.
<!--ID: 1711964130977-->

#### Division of labour
Different workers performing different tasks in a good's/services'
production, specialising to an extent.
<!--ID: 1711964130981-->

#### Economies of scope
When it is cheaper to make a range of products
Economy of scale
When long-run average costs fall as output rises.
<!--ID: 1711964130985-->

#### External economy of scale
Firms saving resulting from growth of the industry a firm is part
of.
<!--ID: 1711964130989-->

#### Fixed cost
Costs of production that do not vary with output, only in the short run.
<!--ID: 1711964130993-->

#### Increasing returns to scale 
When output increases by a larger proportion than the
increase in inputs
<!--ID: 1711964130997-->

#### Internal economy of scale
Firms saving resulting from growth of the firm itself.
<!--ID: 1711964131001-->

#### Labour productivity
Output per worker.
<!--ID: 1711964131004-->

#### Law of diminishing returns
By continually adding variable factors atop fixed factors,
eventually both average and marginal returns to the fixed factor fall.
<!--ID: 1711964131009-->

#### Long run
Time period in which none of the factors of production are fixed, and all can be
varied.
<!--ID: 1711964131012-->

#### Long-run average cost
Long-run total cost per unit of output.
<!--ID: 1711964131016-->

#### Long-run production
When a firm changes the scale of all factors of production.
<!--ID: 1711964131019-->

#### Mechanisation
When a firm transfers from becoming more labour intensive to becoming
more capital intensive
<!--ID: 1711964131023-->

#### Minimum efficient scale (MES)
The lowest level of output at which average costs are
minimised. Dependent on the market structure as well as barriers to entry
<!--ID: 1711964131027-->

#### Normal profit
Total revenue equals total costs; the minimum profit required to keep a firm
operating in an industry
<!--ID: 1711964131031-->

#### Operating costs
Same as variable costs
<!--ID: 1711964131035-->

#### Overheads
Same as fixed costs
<!--ID: 1711964131038-->

#### Production
A set of processes that converts inputs into outputs.
<!--ID: 1711964131042-->

#### Productive efficiency
Minimised average total cost.
<!--ID: 1711964131045-->

#### Productivity
Output per unit of input.
<!--ID: 1711964131049-->

#### Profit
Total revenue subtract total costs.
<!--ID: 1711964131053-->

#### Rate of return
Income received from an investment
<!--ID: 1711964131057-->

#### Returns to scale
The scale by which a firm's output changes as the scale of all inputs are
altered
<!--ID: 1711964131061-->

#### Short run
Time period in which at least one of the factors of production are fixed and cannot
be varied.
<!--ID: 1711964131065-->

#### Specialisation
A worker only performing a specific task or a small range of tasks.
<!--ID: 1711964131068-->

#### Sunk cost
Non-recoverable costs of entering a market
<!--ID: 1711964131071-->

#### Supernormal (abnormal) profit
Any level of profit over and above normal profit
<!--ID: 1711964131075-->

#### Technical economy of scale
Cost saving through changing the production process.
<!--ID: 1711964131079-->

#### Total cost
Total fixed cost added to total variable cost.
<!--ID: 1711964131082-->

#### Total revenue
Price of each good, multiplied by quantity sold.
<!--ID: 1711964131086-->

#### Variable cost
Costs incurred when paying for the variable factors of production.
<!--ID: 1711964131090-->

#### X-inefficiency
When a firm lacks the incentive to control costs. This causes the average
cost of production to be higher than necessary.
<!--ID: 1711964131094-->
