Imperfect information is the situation in which one party has more information than another, leading to an unequal distribution of resources, which will develop into market failure (when the production or consumption of good generates negative externalities which negatively affect society).

Market failure will occur when the social cost of consuming or producing a good or service outweighs the private cost (or the private benefit outweighs the social benefit). Imperfect information can cause this in a number of ways. Take, for example, a chemical company, who pollute the environment as a side product of production. If they prevent this from becoming public knowledge, then they create a situation of imperfect information: consumers will not know that their consumption of a good will perpetuate pollution, and will therefore continue to consume.b This is an example of a demerit good (a good that is overconsumed), and this creates a negative externality in both production and consumption: in production because as the firm produces their product, creating pollution, a negative externality on the environment is created - the private benefit (the benefit for the firm) is higher than the social benefit (the benefit on society); and in consumption because as consumption continues, the firm is allowed to continue their production of these goods. It must be noted that market failure as a result of imperfect information generally manifests in the form of negative externalities in consumption, because the consumer knows less than the firm. Another example of this is used cars - if a seller knows more about the car than the customer, for example that it is faulty, and keeps this information to themselves, then the consumer will make a decision without full information, leading to them purchasing a car that they did not want, because of the fault. This can be demonstrated on the diagram below. The Marginal Private Benefit (MPB) outweighs the Marginal Social Benefit (MSB), demonstrating a negative externality in consumption, and the Marginal Social Cost (MSC) outweighs the Marginal Private Cost (MPC), demonstrating a negative externality in production. This shows that imperfect information leads to market failure because of the deadweight loss to the disadvantaged party, shown in the shaded area.
