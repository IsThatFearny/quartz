Imperfect Information ^7eZXR0En

The Importance of Information ^xsoFkOKg

Symmetric information means that consumers and producers
have perfect information to make their decision. This leads
to an efficient allocation of resources. 

There could also be imperfect information, where information 
is missing, so an informed decision cannot be made. 

This leads to a misallocation of resources. Consumers might 
pay too much or too little, and firms might produce 
the incorrect amount. ^Nr0shQKT

The significance of asymmetric information ^GoHmpnWH

Asymmetric information leads to market failure. This is
when there is unequal knowledge between consumers and
producers. Producers can know more than the consumers,
or the other way around.

Asymmetric information can be linked with the 'principal-agent'
problem. This is when the agent makes decisions for the
principal, but the agent is inclined to act in their own
interests, rather than those of the principal, e.g. shareholders
and managers have different objectives, which might conflict.

Information could be made more widely available through
advertising or government intervention, e.g. pictures on
cigarette boxes. ^9GHS7CBe
