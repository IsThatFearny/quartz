Fiscal Policy and its limitations ^PeXIVfzz

Government spending and taxation are the two main fiscal policy instruments. Governments can change the 
amount of spending and taxation to stimulate the economy. The government could influence the size of the 
circular flow by changing the government budget, and spending and taxes can be targeted in areas which need 
stimulating.

Fiscal Policy aims to stimulate economic growth and stabilise the economy. In the UK, the government spends 
most of their budget on pensions and welfare benefits, followed by health and education. Income tax is the
biggest source of tax revenue in the UK. ^MICI2Aht

Limitations ^wwuKKBtr

- Governments might have imperfect information about the economy, which could lead to inefficient spending. 

- There is a significant time lag involved with employing fiscal policy. It could take months or years to have an 
  effect.

- If the government borrows from the private sector, there are fewer funds available for the private sector, which 
  could lead to crowding out.

- The bigger the size of the multiplier, the bigger the effect

- If interest rates, are high, fiscal policy might not be effective for increasing demand

- If the government spends too much, there could be difficulties paying back debt, which damages the government's credit. ^0H23Yh1l
