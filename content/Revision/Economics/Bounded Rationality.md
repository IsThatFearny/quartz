Bounded rationality/self-control ^NFL5ZQIo

Individuals are generally thought to be rational decision makers who endeavour to maximise their utility.
However, Herbert Simon recognised the limitations of this model, and so devised his own: the bounde-rationality
model. The assumptions of this model are: ^7kMbQbiI

- The first alternative that is satisfactory is selected
- The decision maker recognises that they perceive the world as simple
- The decision maker recognises the need to be comfortable making
decisions without considering every alternative
- Decisions could be made by heuristics ^9PwqdGxR

Bounded self-control assumes that consumers are able to exercise self-control, but in some situations, they are not.
The law of diminishing marginal utility suggests that every extra unit consumed provides smaller benefit to the consumer,
but a person may still choose to eat more than the optimal amount. ^Zd3PvwZQ
