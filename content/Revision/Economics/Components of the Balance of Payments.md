Components of the Balance of Payments ^OIMEeZh9

This is a record of all financial transactions made between consumers, firms and the government from one country with
other countries. It states how much is spent on imports, and what the value of exports is. Exports are goods and
services sold to foreign countries, and are positive in the balance of payments. This is because they are an inflow of
money. Imports are goods and services bought from foreign countries, and they are negative on the balance of payments.
They are an outflow of money.

The balance of payments is made up of:

- The current account: this includes all economic transactions between countries. The main transactions are the trade
  in goods and services, income and current transfers.

- The capital account and financial account: Capital transfers involve transfers of the ownership of fixed assets. The
  financial account involves investment. For example, direct investment, portfolio investment, and reserve assets are part
  the financial account.

- Balancing item: The components of the balance of payments should balance. That is, the sum of the accounts should
  balance. That is, the sum of the accounts should be zero. Where there are imbalances, a balancing item is used to
  cover the discrepancies ^W75HTdBt
