Effects of Inflation and Deflation ^bS78fYKT

Inflation ^GTZBU8O6

Consumers: Those on low and fixed incomes are hit hardest
by inflation, due to its regressive effect, because the cost
of necessities such as food and water becomes expensive.
The purchasing power of money falls, which affects those
with high incomes the least. If consumers have loans, the
value of the repayment will be lower, because the amount
owed does not increase with inflation, so the real value of
debt increases.

Firms: Low interest rates means borrowing and investing is
more attractive than saving profits. With high inflation,
interest rates are likely to be higher, so the cost of
investing will be higher and firms are less likely to invest.
Workers might demand higher wages, which could increase
the costs of production. Firms may be less price competitive
on a global scale if inflation is high. This depends on what
happens in other countries. Unpredictable inflation will reduce
business confidence. This could mean there is less investment.

The Government: the government will have to increase the
value of the state pension and welfare payments, because
the cost of living is increasing.

Workers: Real incomes fall with inflation, so workers will have
less disposable income. If forms face higher costs, then there
could be more redundancies when firms try to cut costs. ^BZu75Jzc

Deflation causes the real value of money to increase.
For example, if average prices fell by 5%, then spending
£1 today will buy 5% more. Deflation discourages
spending because it makes goods and services cheaper in
the future. Consumers believe that, if goods are cheaper
tomorrow, it is not worthwhile buying them today. This can
result in economic decline and increasing rates of
unemployment. Deflation can worsen the effects of economic
stagnation.

Deflation makes the real value of debt higher, which means 
that consumers with higher levels of debt find it harder to
pay off, since a larger proportion of their income will be used
to make repayments. Since consumers have less disposable 
income, the level of spending in the economy falls, which worsens
the effects of a recession. Wages are also likely to fall, since
firms make lower profits. There could be even lower growth and 
worse rates of unemployment if the real interest rate increases.
Saving is encouraged, because the rate of return is higher. ^0GWjUYuB
