Absolute and Comparative Advantage ^1RiDWgPh

Absolute advantage is when a country can produce a good or service using 
fewer resources and a lower cost than another country.

Comparative advantage occurs when a country can produce a good or service
at a lower opportunity cost than another country. This means that they have
to give up producing less of another good than another country, using the same
resources. Countries can specialise where they have comparative advantage.
This increases economic welfare. ^p7VLYice
