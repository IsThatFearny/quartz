> Evaluate policies that could be used to reduce in-work poverty in the UK (25 Marks)

In-work poverty is when people are below the poverty line whilst also being in work. Therefore, policies to increase employment are ineffective against this type of poverty. However, there are multiple policies that could be utilised in reducing in-work poverty, such as a higher minimum wage and living wage, expansionary fiscal policy, and supply-side policies such as improved access to education and training. This essay shall conclude that improved access to training is the best policy to reduce in-work poverty, because it avoids creating inflationary pressure and allows workers to improve their position in workplaces in the long term, improving productivity and helping workers to earn higher wages.

Increasing the minimum wage rate will have a significant effect on in-work poverty. Those who suffer from in-work poverty are often on the minimum wage rate, and so increasing this will increase the amount of income that low-earners in poverty will gain. If the minimum wage is raised to the poverty line (in the UK, relative poverty is classed as earning under 60% of the median wage, approximately £21,000 per year when median wage is assumed to be approx. £35,000), then minimum-wage workers will be able to survive above the poverty line. In addition to this, increasing the living wage rate will have a similar effect. The living wage is a recommended wage at which workers can afford to live at their means (i.e. not in poverty). Employers often pay this wage to ensure that their workers are productive enough and to attract more employees. The living wage, however, often lags behind inflation, causing in-work poverty. Increasing this rate in line with inflation will reduce in-work poverty because workers are able to live at their means. Increases in these rates can be demonstrated on the diagram below (left): an increase in the wage rate, represented by an increase from W* to W + Minimum Wage. The diagram shows that this increase in the wage rate will not be beneficial because workers are being payed more, but also will increasing the employment rate. Workers will be valued correctly for their MRP.

However, raising the minimum wage and living wage rates can have undesirable effects. For example, as can be seen on the diagram above (right), an increase in the wage rate will have an inflationary effect on the economy, moving price from P1 to P2, and causing a decrease in output from Q1 Q2. This will have an overall negative effect on the economy, because the increase in wages will be cancelled out by the increase in inflation. Furthermore, an increased minimum wage will cause increased variable costs for firms, because they will have to pay their existing workers more. This may lead to redundancies because firms cannot afford these costs, and so the unemployment rate may be increased. There will also be an asymmetry between demand and supply, because more people will want to work as a result of increased wages, but firms will want to demand less labour. Overall, increasing the minimum and living wage rates will have a negative effect on the economy, and on individual workers, and therefore it cannot be said to be an effective policy on the whole.

Another method of reducing in-work poverty is to implement expansionary fiscal policy This involves increasing government spending, and cutting taxes. Here, the most effective policy will be decreasing taxation. If direct taxation is reduced , then those in in-work poverty will have more take-home income. If taxation is reduced to a certain level, then this increase in income will lift those in poverty above the poverty line. Furthermore, if indirect taxation is reduced (such as VAT, which is argued to disproportionately affect the poorer in society), then consumer goods will become cheaper. This will allow those suffering from in-work poverty to live above the poverty line because the cost of necessities will decrease. However, there are also substantial downsides to decreasing taxation. Firstly, lowering indirect taxes will have an inflationary effect on the market for necessities, raising the price again. This is because the shift in demand (represented in the diagram below by a shift to the right in the demand curve), caused by lower prices, will cause the price level to increase to its original equilibrium point (from P1 to P2), negating the effect of lower taxation, and making no difference to in-work poverty. Furthermore, less taxation overall will decrease total government revenue, meaning that support for those in in-work poverty will have to be decreased as a result of a smaller budget. Government revenue from taxes is shown in the diagram below (right) by the shaded area - decreasing taxes would remove much of this revenue. This will hurt those in in-work poverty, because, although they are earning more, some still need government infrastructure and the welfare system to aid them in lifting themselves out of poverty. The benefits of taxation are largely negated by the side-effects, and therefore we must conclude that it cannot be an effective policy in reducing in-work poverty.

A third option that governments can use to reduce in-work poverty is to improve the quality of and access to education and training. As previously stated, many of those in in-work poverty work minimum-wage jobs. A large reason for this is that these people do not have the necessary skills or education for any other job. Therefore, if the government improve education and job-specific training, then those who work minimum-wage jobs will be able to progress to better-paid jobs which provide more opportu
