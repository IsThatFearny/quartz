# Diminishing returns 15 marker


> ‘In the real world of business, two observations can consistently be made. Firstly, sooner or later, the law of diminishing returns will operate, and secondly, over time, profit maximising is always a key goal.’

> **Explain the difference between diminishing returns to a factor in the short run, and returns to scale in the long-run.**

In the short-run, at least one factor of production (Labour, Capital, Enterprise, or Land) is fixed. This means that past a certain point, as a factor input increases (such as an increase in employment), the additional profit gained decreases per worker. This occurs because one factor is fixed: if capital were fixed in a coffee shop for example, which has two coffee machines, each operated by a single worker, and more than two workers were hired to operate the machines, then diminishing marginal returns will set in - the extra worker may increase productivity, but not as much as the worker hired before them, because the staff as a whole will be less productive due to their outnumbering the capital that they can use. This is seen on the diagram below: the MC
