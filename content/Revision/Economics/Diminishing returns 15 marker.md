In the short-run, at least one factor of production (Labour, Capital, Enterprise, or Land) is fixed. This means that past a certain point, as a factor input increases (such as an increase in employment), the additional profit gained decreases per worker. This occurs because one factor is fixed: if capital were fixed in a coffee shop for example, which has two coffee machines, each operated by a single worker, and more than two workers were hired to operate the machines, then diminishing marginal returns will set in - the extra worker may increase productivity, but not as much as the worker hired before them, because the staff as a whole will be less productive due to their outnumbering the capital that they can use. This will cause productive inefficiency. This is seen on the diagram below: the MC curve decreases as average costs decrease, but subsequently increases - the point at which MC intersects with AC is the profit maximisation point, because introducing new factor inputs at this point will cause marginal cost to outweigh average costs. Firms will not introduce factors past this point if they wish to maintain profits.

In the long-run, however, this model does not apply. Because in the long-run all factors of production are variable, marginal diminishing returns as a result of disproportionate factor inputs does not exist, as, for example, the coffee shop could invest into more capital (a new coffee machine), expand their shop, etc, all of which would prevent diminishing returns from setting in. As this occurs, firms will be able to introduce more factor inputs, and gain proportionally higher outputs, as productivity can be increased exponentially (assuming that land, labour, capital, and enterprise can be expanded infinitely). This can be demonstrated on the diagram below: as a firm expands their factor inputs, they will move along the LRAC curve, benefitting from increasing returns to scale. When the firm reaches constant returns to scale, they can no longer expand without suffering from diminishing returns to scale, and returning to the short-run
