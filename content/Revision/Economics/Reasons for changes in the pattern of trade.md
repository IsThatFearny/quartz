Reasons for changes in the pattern of trade ^l376W5eS

Comparative Advantage ^jHUv8QWK

There has been a recent growth in the exports of manufactured
goods from developing countries to developed countries. This is
because developing countries have gained an advantage in the
production of manufactured goods, due to their lower labour
costs, so production shifted abroad.

The deindustrialisation of countries such as the UK has meant
the manufacturing sector has declined. This means that production
of manufactured goods has shifted to other countries. This has led
to the industrialisation of these countries, and their share of 
world trade and the volume of manufactured goods that they export
has increased. ^lx7RMfpP

Impact of emerging economies ^nuHWaitI

The collapse of communism has meant that more countries, especially
developing countries, are participating in world trade. International
trade is arguably more important for developing countries than
developed countries. It contributes towards 20% of LDC economies,
compared to 8% of the US economy. ^4Wa1ZX1z

Impact of emerging economies ^An9gJQ4L

With more trading blocs, trade has been created between
members, but diverted from elsewhere. Trade creation
occurs when a country consumers more imports from a low
cost producer, and fewer from a high cost producer.
Usually, a country might stop importing from a cheaper
producer outside a trading bloc to a more expensive one
inside the trading bloc. Moreover, protectionist barriers are
often imposed on countries who are not members, so trade is
diverted from producers outside the bloc to producers
within the bloc.

The policies of developed countries have limited the ability of
developing countries to export primary commodities. For example,
the EU Common Agricultural Policy means that domestic farmers
receive subsidies to lower costs. This increases the incomes of
these farms and protects domestic industry, but farmers in other
countries find it hard to compete, which limits their participation in
trade. ^Lvaxph1s

Changes in Exchange Rates ^tpIgR0lR

For a long time, China has been running a trade surplus with the US.
Since 2006, the US trade deficit has narrowed with China, and China
has reduced their trade surplus too. China has planned this change
from export-led growth to growth fulled by domestic consumption. When
running the trade surplus, China kept their currency's value low in order
to make their exports relatively cheap. ^ZNQdT6Zm
