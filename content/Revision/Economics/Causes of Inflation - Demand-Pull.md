# Text Elements
This is from the demand side of the economy. When aggregate demand is
growing unsustainably, there is a pressure on resources. Producers increase their
prices and earn more profits. It usually occurs when resources are fully employed.

The main triggers for demand-pull inflation are:

- A depreciation in the exchange rate, which causes imports to become more expensive,
  whilst exports become cheaper. This causes AD to rise.

- Fiscal stimulus in the form of lower taxes or more government spending. This means
  consumers have more disposable income, so consumer spending increases.

- Lower interest rates makes saving less attractive and borrowing more attractive, so
  consumer spending increases

- High growth in UK export markets means UK exports increase and AD increases
