Market Interrelationship ^0UJnX7Pk

Changes in one market are likely to affect other markets. This relates to the types of demand and supply, and how they
link to other markets.

                 When the demand for a good is linked to the demand for a related good. For example, the demand for
bricks is derived from the demand for the building of new houses. The demand for labour is derived from the goods that
the labour produces.

                   When the good demanded has more than one use. For example, assuming that there is a fixed supply of
milk, an increase in the demand for cheese will mean that more cheese is supplied, and therefore less butter can be supplied.
 
               This is when goods are bought together, such as a digital camera and a memory card. An increase in demand
for digital cameras is likely to lead to an increase in demand for memory cards.

Demanding substitute goods, such as Samsung Tvs over Panasonic TVs, would reduce the quantity supplied of Panasonic TVs
and also reduce their price.

             When increasing the supply of one good causes a change in the supply of another good. For example, producing
more lamb will increase the supply of wool.
