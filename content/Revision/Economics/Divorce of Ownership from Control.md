Divorce of Ownership from Control ^iPQY6gNq

The principal agent problem can be linked to the theory of asymmetric information. This is when the agent
make decisions for the principal, but the agent is inclined to act in their own interests, rather than those
of the principal. For example, managers might choose to make a personal gain, such as a bonus, rather
than maximise the dividends of the shareholders.

When an owner of a firm sells shares, they lose some of the control they had over the firm. This could
result in conflicting objectives between different stakeholders in the firm. If a manager is particularly good,
they might require higher wages to keep them in the firm. However, they also need to keep shareholders happy,
since they are an important source of investment. it is not always possible to give both the manager a high
salary and the shareholders large dividends, since funds are limited.

When a manager sells their shares, shareholders gain more control over the decisions of the firm. This could
give rise to 'shareholders activism'. This could be to put pressure on the management of the firm or to try
and get higher dividends. ^VFJibKfb
