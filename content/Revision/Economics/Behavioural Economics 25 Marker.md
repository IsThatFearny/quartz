Behavioural economic theory can be utilised by governments in place of traditional economic policy in order to correct various types of market failures arising from various different things. However, whether it is a better alternative to traditional theory is debated. This essay will argue that behavioural economics *is* a viable alternative to traditional economic theory, because it often avoids the negative side-effects that traditional theory encompasses. However, it is dependent on what type of market failure the policy is aimed at.

Behavioural economic theory is particularly suited to correcting market failures arising from merit and demerit goods. A merit good is a good that has a net societal benefit, and is under-consumed, such as healthy food; a demerit good has net societal cost, and is over-consumed (such as alcohol and cigarettes).
