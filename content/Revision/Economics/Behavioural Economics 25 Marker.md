Behavioural economic theory can be utilised by governments in place of traditional economic policy in order to correct various types of market failures arising from various different things. However, whether it is a better alternative to traditional theory is debated. This essay will argue that behavioural economics *is* a viable alternative to traditional economic theory, because it often avoids the negative side-effects that traditional theory encompasses. However, it is dependent on what type of market failure the policy is aimed at.

Behavioural economic theory is particularly suited to correcting market failures arising from merit and demerit goods. A merit good is a good that has a net societal benefit, and is under-consumed, such as healthy food; a demerit good has net societal cost, and is over-consumed (such as alcohol and cigarettes). Using behavioural theory can be used by the government to correct the under-consumption of merit goods and the over-consumption of demerit goods. For example, in the 1990s the government introduced official guidance on how many fruits and vegetables that we should eat to be healthy - ‘five a day’. This is a ‘rule of thumb’, which is a quick mental shortcut that consumers use to make their decisions. If consumers have ‘five a day’ drilled into them, as children in the UK do from primary school, then they are likely to use this rule of thumb in future consumption. Therefore, consumers will consume more healthy foods, specifically fruits and vegetables, going some way in correcting the market failure that arises from their underconsumption. This can be seen on the diagram below: the original market failure can be seen where Marginal Social Benefit outweighs the Marginal Private Benefit. Becomes consumers are rationally self-interested, they will consume less when social benefit is higher than private benefit. Introducing a rule of thumb will decrease the gap between the two (from MPB1 top MPB2), therefore increasing the incentive to consume. Further, the rule of thumb provides improved information about the benefits of eating healthy foods, causing increased consumption. A similar theory applies to demerit goods - the government has introduced images of those in poor health after consuming cigarettes to deter future consumption by others, thus reducing the over-consumption that arises from demerit goods.

It can also be argued, however, that the same effect could be achieved by the use of traditional economic theory. For example, the government charges high rates of tax on alcohol and nicotine products, in an attempt to reduce their consumption (as they are demerit goods). An increased price deters consumers from over-consuming, and thus moves the outcome of consumption of demerit goods closer to the social optimum. Similarly, the government subsidises merit goods such as renewable energy, allowing consumers to invest in and purchase more of these goods, correcting the issue of under-consumption. However, there are limitations to these methods. Firstly, demerit goods are often price and income inelastic, especially if, like cigarettes and alcohol, they are addictive. Consumers will continue to consume until they can continue no longer, even if the price increases. Therefore it can be argued that to correct this type of market failure, non-price behavioural economics must be used. Likewise, subsidising merit goods can also have limitations: it requires increased government spending,
