Law of Diminishing Returns and Returns to Scale ^XRJu47Q3

Short run vs Long run ^BwMYy0aC

In the short run, the scale of production is fixed (there is at least one fixed cost). For
firms, the quantity of labour might be flexible, whilst the quantity of capital is fixed. In 
the long run, the scale of production is flexible and can be changed. All costs are variable. ^tqWWE6Qp

The marginal return of a factor, such as labour, is the extra output derived per extra unit
of the factor employed. For labour, it is the extra output per unit of labour employed. The
average return of a factor is the output per unit of input. This is output per worker over a
period of time. The total return of a factor is the total output produced by a number of
units of factors over a period of time. The amount of capital is fixed. ^p5D3w5GT

Law of diminishing returns ^piShLgLX

Returns to scale ^OoxK73bn

Returns to scale refers to the change in output of a firm after an increase in factor inputs.
Returns to scale increases when the output increases by a greater proportion to the increase
in inputs. The opposite can also occur - this is diminishing returns to scale. Constant returns
to scale are when output increases by the same amount as input. ^mN7ob5ub

Marginal, Average, and Total Returns ^B3NUxu9h

Diminishing returns only occur in the short run. The variable factor could be increased in the
short run. For example, if a firm employs more labour, then over time the labour might become
less productive, so the marginal return of the labour falls. Therefore, total output still rises,
but increases at a slower rate. This is linked to the productivity of labour.

The law assumes that firms have fixed factor resources in the short run and that the state
of technology remains constant. However, the rise of things like outsourcing means that firms can
cut their costs and their production can be flexible. ^9h0xdbRr
