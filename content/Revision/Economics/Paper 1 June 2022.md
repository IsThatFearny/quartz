## 01) 

> [!question]
> Using the data in Extract A (Figure 1), calculate the number of workers doing weekly
> platform work in 2019 for each worker doing monthly platform work in 2019.
> Give your answer to two decimal places. [**2 Marks**]

$\frac{9.6}{11.8} = 0.81$. 0.81:1 weekly:monthly platform work

> [!question]
> Explain how the data in Extract A (Figure 2) show that the incentive for workers to
> become self-employed increased between 2009/10 and 2018/19. [**4 Marks**]

In 2009/10, the median real earnings (after direct taxes) for those who were self-employed was £15,800. By 2018/19 the same measure was at £16,500, having increased in the intervening decade by £700 (accounting for changes in the price level). Meanwhile, the median real earnings after tax of those who were not self-employed decreased in the same time period, from £21,900 to £21,600. A rise in salary in self-employed industry and a decrease in salary in other industries where workers are employed by someone else is highly likely to increase the incentive to become self-employed. Whilst the salary is still higher when not self-employed, an increase in that salary will increase the amount of workers who move to self-employment, because it becomes a more attractive option.

> [!question]
> Extract C (lines 4–5) states that, as a result of trade union action, ‘The hospital trust
> increased their £8.21 minimum wage to the London Living Wage of £10.75.’
> With the help of a diagram, analyse how a trade union might achieve higher pay for its
> members.

Trade Unions achieve their goals (the main one of which is usually higher pay) by utilising ‘free collective bargaining’ - that is, the union can use the threat of a mass strike, or even carry one out, in order to force the hand of firms to pay higher wages. If workers go on strike, especially in an industry where there is high union membership, then the productive capacity of a firm will be significantly reduced in the short run, as can be seen on the diagram below: a reduction in labour will result in an inward shift of LRAS, from LRAS1 to LRAS2. As a result of this, the revenue made by the firm will decrease from P1 to P2, as will the quantity produced, and thus the firm loses profits. This is an unsustainable position for most firms, and in the long-run they may be forced to leave the market, and as such they will be forced to negotiate with a trade union for higher wages.
