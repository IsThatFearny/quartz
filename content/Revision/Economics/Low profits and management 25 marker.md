# Low profits and management 25 marker

</br>

**Reasons for low profits:** Poor management; government regulation; lack of demand (cyclical); high levels of competition; diseconomies of scale

#### Paragraph 1: Poor management

- Profit satisficing - if management has no incentive to increase profits, then they will cause the firm to produce to a point where the owners and shareholders are satisfied. This will cause lower profits because they are not at productive efficiency
- Principal-agent problem - if worker’s/manager’s bonuses are linked to revenue, then the firm will produce at the revenue max point for personal gain, rather than profit max
- Poor investment choices - if the firm has made investment choices which do not pay off (e.g. poor quality technology, )
