Structure of a balance sheet ^dEudmCzZ

Balance sheets show the value of a company's assets, liabilities and owner's equity during
a period of time. It is usually at the end of a quarter or an annum.

A liability is something which must be paid. It is a claim on assets.

An assets is something that can be sold for value. The owner's equity is also called bank
capital and it is what is left over when assets have been sold and liabilities have been paid.

Liabilities are used to buy assets, and income can be earned from these assets. They are
made up of share capital, deposits, borrowing and reserve funds. Assets are cash, securities
and bills, loans and investments ^WTsbm4QS
