Causes of Cyclical Instability ^iX9ECqQ9

Sustainability of economic growth ^Owkn0ikg

Growth is sustainable when the rate of economic
growth can be maintained in the long run, so
future generations can enjoy the same rate
of growth. Fast economic growth today could mean
that natural resources might deplete, which would
create environmental problems for future generations,
and mean the future rate of growth might be weak.
Unsustainable growth occurs around the boom and bust
sections of the business cycle. These are essentially
deviations from the trend rate of growth. If growth
is excessive, there could be inflation in the average
price level, wages and assets. There could be
excessive credit, which is unsustainable in the long run,
and the savings rate might be low or falling. ^0vtX4zYF

Excessive Growth in credit/debt ^y6DFjSXK

A market bubble occurs when the price of an asset
is predicted to rise significantly. This causes it to
be traded more, and demand exceeds supply so the 
price rises beyond the intrinsic value. The bubble then
'bursts' when the price steeply and suddenly falls
to its ordinary level. This causes panic and investors
try and sell their assets. It results in a loss of
confidence and can lead to economic decline or a
depression. ^CXK9WfGm

Asset Price Bubbles ^TRNB1JeI

Growth that is financed by public debt might not
be sustainable. It might be difficult to pay it in
the future, and it does not contribute to 
improvements in productivity. By being more
productive, growth is likely to be more sustainable.
This is since it increases the economy's productive
capacity, so there is more room to grow. ^w6Q3SIUQ
