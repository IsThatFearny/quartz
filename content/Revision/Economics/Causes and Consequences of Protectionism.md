Causes and Consequences of Protectionism ^IqVFAMYT

If a country employed several protectionist measures, then a trade deficit would reduce. This
is because they will be importing less due to tariffs and quotas on imports.

Infant industries might need protecting. These are industries which are relatively new and receive
support. Protectionism is usually short term until the industry develops, at which point the industry
can trade freely.

Protectionism could be used to correct market failure. It can deal with demerit goods and protect
society from them.

Governments might employ protectionist measures to improve the current account deficit.

Governments might want to protect domestic jobs. ^1ByhGnij

Protectionism could distort the market and lead to a loss of allocative efficiency. It prevents
industries from competing in a competitive market and there is a loss of consumer welfare. Consumers
face higher prices and less variety. By not competing in a competitive market, firms have little or no
incentive to lower their costs of production.

It imposes an extra cost on exporters, which could lower output and damage the economy

Tariffs are regressive and are most damaging to those on low and fixed incomes.

There is a risk of retaliation from other countries, so countries might become hostile.

Protectionism could lead to government failure. ^a7cUr8Jz
