The Monetary Policy Committee ^ALfCykkT

In the UK, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) alters interest rates to control the supply
of money. They are independent from the government, and consist of 9 members who meet 8
times a year to discuss what the rate of interest should be.

Interest rates are used to help meet the government of price stability and a 2% inflation
rate, since it alters the cost of borrowing and the reward for saving.

The bank controls the base rate, defined as the interest rate set by central banks for
lending to other banks. This is used as a benchmark for interest rates set by
commercial banks. ^DSokBL3x

Factors considered by the MPC ^WR5oeYQ0

Unemployment rate: if unemployment is high, consumer spending is likely to fall. This suggests
that the MPC will drop interest rates to encourage more spending.

Savings rate: if there is a lot of saving, consumers are not spending as much. Interest
rates might fall.

Consumer spending: if there is a high level of spending, there could be inflationary pressures. This
would cause the MPC to increase interest rates.

High commodity prices: since the UK is a net importer of oil, a high price could lead to cost-push
inflation. This could push the MPC to increase interest rates to overcome inflationary pressure.

Exchange rate: a weak pound would cause the average price level to increase. This makes UK
exports relatively cheap, and so exports increase. ^Ah2v9Tqr
