The government can use free-market supply side policies in order to regulate the competitiveness and efficiency of UK Labour markets and the economy as a whole. Whilst there is an argument to be made that free-market supply-side policies in labour markets can have a detrimental effect on economic performance, the view that these reforms are beneficial to the UK economy is the more plausible argument, because … As such, this essay shall argue that free market supply-side reforms to labour markets are indeed beneficial to the UK economy.

Trade union power determines much of how efficiently a labour market functions. The role of a Trade Union is to negotiate higher wages for their members through ‘free collective bargaining’. A trade union can negotiate a wage increase from W* to Wtu through free collective bargaining, preventing the exploitation of workers, as shown in the diagram below. This is especially effective in a market where there is a bi-lateral monopoly, i.e. a market in which there is one employer (the monopsonist) and one provider of labour (the Trade Union). However, despite providing a useful service for their members, trade unions cause inefficiency. An increase in wages from W* to Wtu will cause average costs for firms to increase from, which will likely cause firms to decrease their demand for employment to maintain normal profit, and as shown in the diagram, employment in that industry will move from Q* to Qtu, causing more unemployment. This means that firms will not be maximising their available capacity, and will become productively inefficient, as can be seen on the PPF below - the firm is operating at point X rather than point Y, demonstrating reduced capacity.

Therefore, in order to reduce this inefficiency, the UK government can introduce trade union legislation to regulate their power. For example, the Employment Act 1990 banned the ‘closed shop’, whereby all workers in an industry had to be part of a union. This reduced the power of free collective bargaining, because not all workers had to strike when the union went on strike. Thus, the trade unions might only be able to raise the wage rate to a lower level than Wtu, causing an increase in employment when compared to the Wtu wage rate.
