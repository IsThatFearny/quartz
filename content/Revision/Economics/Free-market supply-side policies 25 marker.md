The government can use free-market supply side policies in order to regulate the competitiveness and efficiency of UK Labour markets and the economy as a whole. Whilst there is an argument to be made that free-market supply-side policies in labour markets can have a detrimental effect on economic performance, the view that these reforms are beneficial to the UK economy is the more plausible argument, because … As such, this essay shall argue that free market supply-side reforms to labour markets are indeed beneficial to the UK economy.

Trade union power determines much of how efficiently a labour market functions. The role of a Trade Union is to negotiate higher wages for their members through ‘free collective bargaining’. A trade union can negotiate a wage increase from W* to Wtu through free collective bargaining, preventing the exploitation of workers, as shown in the diagram below. This is especially effective in a market where there is a bi-lateral monopoly, i.e. a market in which there is one employer (the monopsonist) and one provider of labour (the Trade Union). However, despite providing a useful service for their members, trade unions cause inefficiency. An increase in wages from W* to Wtu will cause average costs for firms to increase from, which will likely cause firms to decrease their demand for employment to maintain normal profit, and as shown in the diagram, employment in that industry will move from Q* to Qtu, causing more unemployment. This means that firms will not be maximising their available capacity, and will become productively inefficient, as can be seen on the PPF below - the firm is operating at point X rather than point Y, demonstrating reduced capacity.

Therefore, in order to reduce this inefficiency, the UK government can introduce trade union legislation to regulate their power. For example, the Employment Act 1990 banned the ‘closed shop’, whereby all workers in an industry had to be part of a union. This reduced the power of free collective bargaining, because not all workers had to strike when the union went on strike. Thus, the trade unions might only be able to raise the wage rate to a lower level than Wtu, causing an increase in employment when compared to the Wtu wage rate. In terms of the entire economy, the industry will operate closer to point Y on the PPF. This move closer to productive efficiency means that firms in that industry will have lower costs, allowing them to lower their prices for their product. If demand is particularly elastic for a certain industry, then this will cause a more than proportional increase in demand, stimulating the economy. Further to this, inflation can be lowered as a result of lower overall prices (because Trade Union legislation affects industries nationwide). Another potential benefit to the UK economy of reduced trade union power is increased foreign investment - Nissan, for example, only saw fit to invest in a UK plant in 1986 when days lost to strikes fell. This increase in investment may create more jobs, and make a local population better off financially, causing an increase in consumption and boosting both local and national demand. However, there is also a trade-off in reducing trade union power. Firstly, trade unions do not only negotiate for better wages, but also better working conditions. Allowing firms to have more power over working conditions may result in poor conditions for workers, which in turn will decrease their productivity, because employees may be less healthy, less motivated, etc. Not only this, but trade union controls may result in failing industries: if labour is mobile, and workers are unhappy in their jobs due to poor wages or working conditions, then they may leave that job. This will result in a situation where demand for labour outstrips supply, and firms will not be able to maintain the level of output required to make normal profits. This may result in government bailouts, bankruptcy, and the like, all of which are detrimental to the economy as a whole. Reducing trade union power to a certain extent may be ok for UK industry and the economy, but if regulation is pushed too far then negative consequences may arise as a result.
