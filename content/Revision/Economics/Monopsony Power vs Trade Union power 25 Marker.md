# Monopsony Power vs Trade Union power 25 Marker

> Since the 1980s, politicians have been freeing up one side of the labour market by reducing the power of trade unions and their influence over the supply of labour. Meanwhile, they have been doing very little about the monopsony power of employers.

Monopsony power is when there is a single employer in a market. For example, coal mines are largely owned by the state, and therefore all coal miners who work in these mines are employees of the state - there is only one employer of labour in the coal mining market. This can be beneficial to markets to some extent, but can also cause major issues for the welfare of workers. This essay shall evaluate whether labour markets work better when monopsony power is higher than trade union power; whether the opposite is true; or whether the market functions better when the two are in equilibrium, and shall conclude that the labour market functions at its best when the power of a monopsony employer and trade unions are equal to one another, because both the employer and the workers get the best compromise.

There are multiple benefits to firms of being a monopsony employer with more power than their respective trade union. Because the firm can set the wage rate (as employees are forced to work at whatever wage is set), they are able to lower their costs by setting wages at the lowest possible rate (sometimes at the minimum wage). This is shown on the diagram below - the AC curve shifts outwards, denoting lower average costs for the firm (as a result of lower variable costs, i.e. wages). This will allow the firm to increase their quantity supplied from Q1 to Q2. An increase in supply without a corresponding increase in costs will allow the firm to increase their profit margins and make higher profits. The firm could choose to use this extra money to invest in research and development, which will increase the productivity of the firm and raise their profits further. The firm may also choose to hire more workers (albeit at a lower wage). If this is the chosen option, then the condition of the labour market will be improved, because any disequilibrium where supply outstrips demand will be brought back into equilibrium, allowing the market to function more efficiently.

However, disproportionate monopsony power can have negative effects on the economy. If mobility of labour is high, such as in unskilled industries, then when faced with lower wages set by a monopsony employer, workers may choose to enter into another labour market which perhaps might give them more power over their wages or higher wages in general. This will decrease the supply of labour in the market, leading to a situation where demand for labour outstrips supply. As can be seen in the below diagram, a reduction in supply (represented by an inward shift from S1 to S2) will lead to higher costs for the firm (P1 to P2), and lower quantity produced (from Q1 to Q2, causing them to lose profits (profit loss is represented by the shaded area). This will result in an inefficient allocation of resources and labour within the market. This leads us to conclude that, overall, disproportionate monopsony power in comparison to trade union power will lead to a more inefficient labour market.
