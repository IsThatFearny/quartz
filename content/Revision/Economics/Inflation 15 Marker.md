Inflation occurs when there is a rise in the general price level across the economy. It is measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), which calculates the increase in price of 650 goods which are commonly consumed. Inflation has many causes, which can be classified into two main categories: demand-pull and cost-push.

Demand-pull inflation is when inflation rises due to an an increase in demand for goods across the economy. One reason that this may occur is an increase in the amount of disposable income that households have. For example, a reduction in income tax rates will cause households to have more take-home income, which will lead them to consume more, causing a shift in AD from AD1 to AD2, as seen in the diagram below. This shift will move the price equilibrium to AS1AD2, which raises the price level from P1 to P2, representing an increase in the inflation rate. Other factors could also cause this, such as a lowering of the base rate, which will cause commercial banks to lower their own interest rates. This in turn will deter saving and promote taking out loans, giving consumers more money to consume with, leading to a similar shift in AD (from AD1 to AD2). Changes internationally can also have an effect on demand: if the pound appreciates, then people are more likely to import more, because imports become cheaper. This, again, causes them to consume more and this increased demand pushes up the price level, causing inflation.

The other form of inflation is cost-push. Cost-push inflation is caused by increasing costs forcing prices to rise. For example, if corporation tax is increased, and overall demand is elastic, then consumers will have to reduce supply to maintain normal profits. This means that Aggregate Supply will shift inwards from AS1 to AS2 (as seen on the diagram below), causing an increase in the price level from P1 to P2, and therefore an increase in the inflation rate. A similar effect can be seen from external supply-side shocks: if, for example, OPEC (the cartel of oil-producing nations) decides to restrict supply to their clients, then the reduction in supply (represented by the shift from AD1 to AD2) will again drive up prices, causing inflation. Cost-push inflation could also occur if the governmentâ€™s public spending burden increases: if there is an increase in unemployment, then automatic stabilisers such as welfare benefits will increase in cost, leading to higher overall costs for the government.
