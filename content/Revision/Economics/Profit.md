Profit ^PxL7nZIi

Profit is the difference between total revenue and total costs. 

Normal profit is the minimum reward required to keep entrepreneurs supplying their enterprise. 
It covers the opportunity cost of investing funds into the firm and not elsewhere. This is when 
total revenue = total costs (TR = TC). Normal profit is considered to be a cost, so it is included 
in the costs of production.

Supernormal profit is the profit above normal profit. This exceeds the value of opportunity cost of
investing funds into the firm. This is when TR > TC. ^19748dZ0

The Role of Profit ^RvP62PJp

In a free market economy, profit is the reward the entrepreneurs yield when they take risks and make
investments. An entrepreneur wants to avoid loss and gain profit, which makes them want to innovate,
so they can reduce their production costs and improve the quality of their products. Entrepreneurs
seek to maximise their profits.

Profits can be retained, so they are kept within the firm and not given to shareholders as dividends.
This can be a source of finance for firms if they choose to make an investment. It helps them avoid
the costs of interest payments if they borrow money.

Profits can also act as a signal to firms and consumers, e.g. in markets with supernormal profits, new
firms are likely to enter the market. This increases market supply and lowers the market price. This
assumes the market is contestable and there are no (or low) barriers to entry. Scarce economic
resources generally flow where rewards to investment are higher. The factors of production are used
in markets where the rate of return is higher. ^iZ4fs9HX
