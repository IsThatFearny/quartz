Capital and current expenditure, and transfer payments ^rEshsA7p

Current government expenditure is spending which recurs. This is on goods and services which are consumed
and last for a short period of time. For example, it could be on drugs for the health service.

Capital government expenditure is spent on assets, which can be used multiple times. it could be government
expenditure on roads or building a school.

Transfer payments are welfare payments from the government. They aim to provide a minimum standard of
living for those on low incomes. No goods or services are exchanged for transfer payments. Examples in the
UK include the Job Seeker's Allowance; Income Support; Child benefits; and state pensions. These are in
place to ensure that people have a basic standard of living and to help reduce the level of inequality in
society. Transfer payments are a means for the government to redistribute income from the rich to the poor. ^PLQ8xFss
