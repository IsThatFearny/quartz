Inflation and Deflation ^2itbofII

Inflation is the sustained rise in the general price level over time. This means that the cost of
living increases and the purchasing power of money decreases.

Deflation is the opposite, where the average price level in the economy falls. There us a negative
inflation rate.

Disinflation is the falling rate of inflation, This is when the average price level is still rising, but
to a slower extent. This means goods and services are relatively cheaper now than a year ago,
and the purchasing power of money has increased.

It is important to note that deflationary government policies aim to reduce AD, and do not
necessarily result in deflation. ^eMVoVOfL
