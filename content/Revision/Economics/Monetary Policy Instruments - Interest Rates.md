Monetary Policy Instruments - Interest Rates ^foDHtqLZ

A reduction in interest rates (i.e. expansionary monetary policy affects each determinant of AD (C+I+G+(X-M)) ^FKgwnZhJ

Consumer Spending (C) ^KsiSgAZ2

Low interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of saving, because it is cheaper for consumers to borrow from
commercial banks.
Households with variable rate mortgages benefit through lower repayments, which increases disposable income and,
as a result, increases their marginal propensity to consume.
Lower base rates also increases the number of mortgages taken out by households, so the demand for houses
rises. Due to the supply of houses in the UK being PES inelastic, this results in a proportionately larger increaser
in house prices. This triggers a positive wealth effect, whereby people spend more as they feel richer, which boosts
consumption. ^8AeXHAZI

Investment (I) ^XgR5jAEU

Low interest rates mean it is cheaper for firms to borrow from commercial banks, and use these cheap loans to fund
R&D or other forms of investment. Investment will also increase if consumer spending does, according to the accelerator
effect, as investment is a derived demand. ^inMcu1w2

Government spending (G) ^CZYpIyXg

Low interest rates mean government debt repayments will be lower, and so will encourage the government to issue more
bonds to contribute to higher levels of government spending. ^sj4COIQ9

Exports - Imports (X-M) ^DM7TUDSu

Interest rates affect the amount of hot money flowing into an economy: this being money that flows from different 
countries in search of the highest interest rates to maximise short-term profits. So a low interest rate would reduce 
the flow of hot money into the economy, as the rate of return is lower than in other countries. This weakens the 
exchange rate, as it increases the supply of the £ on FOREX markets - or decreases the demand for the pound. This 
increases the price competitiveness of exports, as they become cheaper. However, imports become more expensive, and 
this could mean higher costs of production (and therefore prices), which would eliminate any increase in exports.
