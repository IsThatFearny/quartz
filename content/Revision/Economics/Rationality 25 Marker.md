*Homo Economicus*, the idea of a man that will act as a rational being to pursue their own self-interest/maximise their own utility is a commonly used model and assumption for many economic theories. However, there is substantial evidence to suggest that this model is not always realistic. This essay will explore multiple different reasons why an individual economic agent might not act rationally, and conclude that the view stated above is often untrue.

Addiction, as in the example above, is a very good example of humans behaving irrationally and not maximising their utility. The rational choice for a consumer is not to use nicotine products, because they will cause long-term negative health effects which are undesirable and do not maximise utility. However, because nicotine is highly addictive, consumers make the irrational choice and choose to consume nicotine products anyway. In the case of vaping, this may be because of imperfect information for the consumer. Cigarettes have long been advertised to be harmful, and this has resulted in a decline in the consumption of cigarettes. However, because vaping products have been advertised as a ‘safe’ alternative to cigarettes, the consumer is often not aware of the health risks that they pose. This will lead to over-consumption. Because of this lack of information, consumers cannot act rationally. The effects of imperfect information causing irrational behaviour can also be seen in the market for second-hand cars. Some cars are ‘lemons’, cars that will work for the first 10 miles after you leave the garage, and will then break down due to a fault. Usually, this fault is known to the dealer, but this information is not given to the consumer. Therefore, the consumer will act irrationally, and choose to purchase the car at a massively inflated price. The rational choice would be to buy another car, but the consumer might believe that they are getting a good deal because of imperfect information, and act irrationally. The diagram below shows this situation: the consumer deadweight loss is represented by the shaded area, and results from demand higher than the market equilibrium (a shift from D1 to D2), which is in turn caused by irrational decisions. There are many examples of imperfect information causing irrational behaviour, and so the view that economic agents will always act rationally to maximise their utility is clearly false.

Another factor that can cause irrational behaviour by consumers is the effect had by various biases. The use of ‘rules of thumb’ is a common cause of irrational behaviour. If consumers have rules of thumb that they use to quickly make decisions, then they will often not maximise their utility in the way that they could if they deliberated about the choice. Take for example brand loyalty. When choosing a product, someone might have a rule of thumb to only by a certain brand, to make the decision easier and quicker. However, this brand might not be the cheapest, nor the best, and so they will not maximise their utility, and will be acting irrationally. Another example of a bias which causes irrational behaviour is anchoring bias, which is the tendency of people to rely on the first piece of information that they are given. We can extend the previous example to demonstrate this too: if a consumer has been introduced to a brand of a good before all other brands, then they may be more likely to purchase this brand in future. Again, this may not be the cheapest or the best, and so they will act irrationally. A consumer may also become biased through advertising or societal pressure, and so make irrational choices. These examples of bias clearly demonstrate how consumers may act irrationally and not maximise their utility in certain circumstances, and so the view can be damaged further.

Another behavioural factor that will affect the rational decision making of a consumer is choice architecture. There are three types of choice: default choice, restricted choice, and mandated choice. A default choice is the choice that someone makes automatically, e.g. in an opt-out organ donation scheme, the default choice is to remain in the scheme. Often, people accept the default choice without knowing the full implications of it: a person may not be aware of the organ donation scheme, and so accept the default choice without technically agreeing with what they are a part of - this may be an irrational choice. Restricted choice is when economic agents are presented with a limited amount of choices, for example if a convenience store only sells food that is bad for you, then consumers have no healthy choices, and will have to make an irrational choice. Mandated choice is when a choice is, technically, no longer a choice - the agent is forced to make a choice. This could cause irrational behaviour, if, for example, an agent has to pay a certain level of tax. They have no choice (save for going to jail) to do this, even though it does not maximise their utility. Therefore, we may conclude that choice architecture can prevent consumers from making rational decisions and maximising their utility, and thus the view is flawed.

In sum, behavioural factors such as imperfect information, biases, and choice architecture often prevent agents from making rational decisions and maximising their utility. It can thus be concluded that the above view is flawed: there are many situations in which individual economic agents make irrational choices.
