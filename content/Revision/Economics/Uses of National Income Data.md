Uses of National Income Data ^bzj8ojJz

Assessing changes in living standards over time ^SpKChU2q

Issues for GDP:
- Nominal GDP is not adjusted for inflation, and so can
be misleading
- GDP cannot take into account hidden transactions
- GDP cannot take into account overseas income

There are alternatives to GDP:

- GNP (Gross National Product): The market value of of all
products produced per annum by the labour and property supplied
by the citizens of a country. Includes GDP + income earned from
overseas assets - income earned by those living overseas.

- GNI (Gross National Income): The sum of value added by all
producers who reside in a nation + product taxes (- subsidies)
not included in the value of output + primary income from abroad
 ^K7IdbAKr

Assessing changes in living standards between countries ^e5pVKwS2

Issues for GDP:
- GDP does not give any indication of the distribution of income
- GDP may need to be recalculated in terms of purchasing power
to account for international price differences
- GDP gives no indication of welfare ^9eAvvUxI
