The Role of Financial Markets ^MhBiSWhS

Financial liquid assets are exchanged in a financial market. The stock exchange and the bond market
are two examples of financial markets. ^dcr1Bmgq

To facilitate saving:


To lend to businesses and individuals:


To facilitate the exchange of goods and services:



To provide forward markets in currencies and commodities:









To provide a market for equities: ^dkeIrndt

                     Financial markets provide somewhere for consumers and firms to store their funds.
Savings are rewarded with interest payments from the bank.

                                      The transfer of funds between agents is aided by financial markets.
The funds can be used for investment or consumption.

                                                   The transfer of real economic resources is facilitated
in a financial market. Financial markets can make it easier to exchange goods and services from the
physical market, by providing a way that buyers and sellers can interact and transfer funds.

                                                          The currency market is another kind of financial
market. They are used to trade one currency for another currency. Currencies can have speculative attacks
taken on them, which can affect the value of the exchange rate.

In commodity markets, investors trade primary products, such as wheat, gold, and oil. Future contracts are a
method for investing in commodities. This involves buying or selling an asset with an agreed price in the present.
But a delivery and payment in the future.

A forward market is an informal financial market where these contracts for future delivery are made.

                                  Equity markets involve the trade of shares. It is also called a stock market.
Equity markets provide access to capital for firms, and allow investors to own part of a market. Returns on
the investment, usually in the form of dividends, are based on future performance. A dividend is a share of the
firm's profits. ^yeKcvNtl
