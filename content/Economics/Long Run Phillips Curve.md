# Long Run Phillips Curve

The Long Run Phillips curve is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment

This just means the level of voluntary unemployment: structural, frictional, and seasonal.

## Policy Implications

##### Short Run

Governments must accept either low inflation but high unemployment or low unemployment but high inflation

##### Long Run

This trade off does not exist - any attempt to reduce unemployment will only increase inflation and result in the same amount of employment in the long run.

Likewise a fall in AD will only decrease inflation with no rise in unemployment

## Key Takeaways

The argument therefore is for the government to focus on supply-side improvements rather than tinker with demand-side policies. By focusing on improving Q<sub>2</sub>CELL the government can shift LRPC inwards and achieve a lower NRU by reducing voluntary unemployment.
