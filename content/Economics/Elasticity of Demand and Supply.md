# Price Elasticity of Demand and Supply

</br>

## Elasticity of Demand

Price Elasticity is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity of a good demanded to a change in it's price.

Elastic Demand: A change in price leads to a larger proportionate change in quantity demanded

Inelastic Demand: A change in price leads to a smaller proportionate change in quantity demanded


Formula: $$\frac{Percentage\:Change\:in\: quantity\: demanded}{Percentage\:Change\:in\: Price}$$

### Elasticity in diagrams
</br>

#### Relatively elastic demand 

QD changes by a larger % than P

![[Relatively Elastic Demand Curve]]

</br>

#### Perfectly elastic demand

Buyers prepared to buy all they can at some given price but none at all at a higher or lower price.

![[Perfect Elastic Demand Curve]]

</br>

#### Perfectly inelastic demand

QD does not change as P changes

![[Perfectly Inelastic Demand Curve]]

</br>

#### Relatively inelastic demand

QD changes by a smaller % than P

![[Relatively Inelastic Demand Curve]]

</br>

#### Unitary Demand

Change in QD = Change in P

</br>

### Total Revenue
</br>

![[Price Elasticity of Demand 2022-11-30 10.29.29]]

###### Relatively Inelastic

Original Total Revenue = 40 x 40 = 1600

New Total Revenue (On Price Increase) = 60 x 35 = 2100

Increase of 500 units.

###### Relatively Elastic

Original Total Revenue = 40 x 100 = 4,000

New Total Revenue (On Price Increase) = 60 x 45 = 2700

Decrease of 1,300 units

</br>

#### Inelastic Demand

If a good has inelastic demand then:

- A reduction in price will reduce the firm's total revenue
- An increase in price will increase the firm's total revenue
</br>

#### Elastic Demand

If a good has elastic demand then: 

- A reduction in price will increase the firm's total revenue
- An increase in price will decrease the firm's total revenue

</br>

## Elasticity of Supply
</br>

A measure of the responsiveness of supply to a change in price

Formula:

$$\frac{percentage\:change\:in\:quantity\:supplied}{percentage\:change\:in\:price} $$

</br>

### Perfectly Elastic Supply

A change in price leads to a larger proportionate change in QS.

### Perfectly Inelastic Supply

A change in price leads to a smaller proportionate change in QS.

### Factors affecting PES

- Time period - The longer the time period, the more elastic supply will be
- Spare Capacity - The more spare capacity a firm has, the more elastic supply is
- Higher stock levels - The higher stock levels are, the more elastic supply is
- Factor mobility - The easier factors of production can be moved, the more elastic supply will be
</br>

## Income Elasticity of Demand

</br>

- YED = % change in quantity demanded over % change in income

- YED examines the effect on demand for goods and services when consumers incomes change

- It classifies goods as :
	- Inferior goods
	- Necessity goods
	- Luxury goods

- If YED > 1, then the good is a luxury good.

- If 0 < YED < 1, then the good is a necessity good. As incomes rise, demand rises by a relatively small percentage, e.g. rice, bread, etc.

- If YED < 0, then the good is an inferior good. As incomes rise, demand for the good falls, e.g. supermarket 'value' products.

- The greater the value (or closeness for 0 for necessity goods), the stronger the relationship
</br>

## Cross Price Elasticity of Demand

- XED = % change in quantity demanded good A over % change in price of good B

- If XED is negative, as the price of one good rises, demand for the other falls. These are complimentary goods. 

- The bigger the value, the stronger the relationship.

- If it is < 1 then we call them weak. If it is > 1 we call them strong.

- If XED is positive, then as the price of one good rises, demand for the other rises. We classify them as substitutes.

- If XED is 0, then a change in the price of one good does nothing to demand for the other good. We classify them as unrelated.
