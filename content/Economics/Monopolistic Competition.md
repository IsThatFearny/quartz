# Monopolistic Competition
</br>

### Assumptions of monopolistic competition

- Imperfect information
- Low barriers to entry or exit
- Slightly differentiated goods (this means that firms are price-makers because they can change the price of their goods)
- Low market concentration
- Lots of smaller sellers

### Chain of reasoning

If goods are not homogenous —> then goods are not perfect substitutes —> this causes demand to become more inelastic

The outcomes of this are:

- Firms are still profit maximising
- Only normal profit (AR = AC)
- Firms are productively and allocatively inefficient
