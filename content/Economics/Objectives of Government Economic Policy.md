# Objectives of Government Economic Policy
</br>





### What is Macroeconomics?
- Macroeconomics considers the economy *as a whole*
- Macroeconomics looks at the success or failure of government policies
- It involves data to analyse the performance of the economy, e.g. GDP
- Macroeconomics involves studying the big issues that affect everyone in the economy, e.g. inflation, trade, development and inequality

- [[Economics/Glossary#Economic Growth|Economic Growth]] occurs when the GDP of an economy rises
- [[Economics/Glossary#GDP|GDP]] is simply the value of everything that is produced in the economy
- We use Real GPD (rather than nominal GDP) as it takes away the effect of inflation
- GDP figures are updated monthly and quarterly (the latter being used more)

- ##### What is the definition of GDP?

	GDP (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Gross Domestic Product</mark> ) is a measure of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">all the activity</mark> of companies, governments and individuals in a country

- ##### Why do most economists like to see GDP rising?

	A rising GDP often means that people will spend more (because they have more disposable income), more jobs are created, more tax is paid and better pay rises are given

- ##### When is an economy in recession?

	An economy is in recession when the economy has been falling for six months (or two quarters) in row, and this can cause loss of jobs and freezes or even drops in pay

- ##### What are the three ways to measure GDP?

	GDP can be measured using three methods. The first is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Output</mark> , which is the total value of the goods and services provided by the economy as a whole. The second is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Expenditure</mark>, which is the value of goods and services bought by households and by the government. The third is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Income</mark>, which is the value of the income generated

- ##### What are some of the problems with GDP?

	GDP may not take into account unpaid work, or inequality (such as only the rich getting more money, and not the rest of the population). GDP also does not necessarily indicate an improvement in the standard of living. It may just indicate a growth in the population 

- ##### What is forecasted to happen to GDP in 2023?

	The economy is forecasted to shrink until the end of the year (recession)

### Low and Stable Inflation
- Inflation is a general rise in average prices across the economy
- The inflation target in the UK is 2%
- Negative inflation - falling average prices - is called deflation
- The key measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) - which calculates the average price increase of 700 consumer items in a basket over a period of 12 months

### Questions to be answered on Low Inflation, using article below

</br>





- ##### What exactly is a 'cost of living crisis'?
A cost of living crisis is the fall in 'real' disposable income (income when put in the context of inflation)
- ##### Why is inflation so high at the moment?
There are multiple reasons that inflation is currently very high...
	- Energy bills having risen rapidly because of high oil and gas prices
	- Petrol and diesel prices have also risen, partly due to the war in Ukraine
	- Food prices, also partly caused by rising grain prices due to the Ukraine war
	- Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, household goods and rising costs in the hospitality sector
	- Higher interest rates which cause mortgage rates to increase for homeowners
- ##### What is happening to wages?
Pay increases aren't keeping up with rising prices, leading to a drop in 'real' wages (wages in the context of inflation). However, if wages reflect the cost of living, it is possible that this could drive inflation even higher (according to the government)
- ##### How is the inflation rate calculated?
The Office for National Statistics calculates the inflation rate by keeping track of the increase in the price of hundreds of commonly bought goods. This is known as the basket of goods. This is known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- ##### What can be done to reduce the rate of inflation?
	- Energy Cost Caps
	- Raising interest rates making borrowing money more expensive

</br>

### Full employment
- Full employment means that everyone who is willing and able to work has a job
- In reality, there will always be some unemployment, due to the changing nature of labour markets
- Unemployment is measured by the claimant count - the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits - or the labour force survey - a quarterly survey of households across the UK (50k per quarter approx)
