# Objectives of Government Economic Policy
</br>

### What is Macroeconomics?
- Macroeconomics considers the economy *as a whole*
- Macroeconomics looks at the success or failure of government policies
- It involves data to analyse the performance of the economy, e.g. GDP
- Macroeconomics involves studying the big issues that affect everyone in the economy, e.g. inflation, trade, development and inequality
</br>

### Primary Macro Objectives Recap

![[Economics/Macroeconomic Objectives]]

</br>

### Economic Growth

- [[Economics/Glossary#Economic Growth|Economic Growth]] occurs when the GDP of an economy rises
- [[Economics/Glossary#GDP|GDP]] is simply the value of everything that is produced in the economy
- We use Real GPD (rather than nominal GDP) as it takes away the effect of inflation
- GDP figures are updated monthly and quarterly (the latter being used more)


</br>


### Questions to be answered on Economic Growth, using article below
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13200758

</br>

- ##### What is the definition of GDP?

	GDP (<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Gross Domestic Product</mark> ) is a measure of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">all the activity</mark> of companies, governments and individuals in a country

- ##### Why do most economists like to see GDP rising?

	A rising GDP often means that people will spend more (because they have more disposable income), more jobs are created, more tax is paid and better pay rises are given

- ##### When is an economy in recession?

	An economy is in recession when the economy has been falling for six months (or two quarters) in row, and this can cause loss of jobs and freezes or even drops in pay

- ##### What are the three ways to measure GDP?

	GDP can be measured using three methods. The first is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Output</mark> , which is the total value of the goods and services provided by the economy as a whole. The second is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Expenditure</mark>, which is the value of goods and services bought by households and by the government. The third is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Income</mark>, which is the value of the income generated

- ##### What are some of the problems with GDP?

	GDP may not take into account unpaid work, or inequality (such as only the rich getting more money, and not the rest of the population). GDP also does not necessarily indicate an improvement in the standard of living. It may just indicate a growth in the population 

- ##### What is forecasted to happen to GDP in 2023?

	The economy is forecasted to shrink until the end of the year (recession)

</br>

### Low and Stable Inflation
- Inflation is a general rise in average prices across the economy
- The inflation target in the UK is 2%
- Negative inflation - falling average prices - is called deflation
- The key measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) - which calculates the average price increase of 700 consumer items in a basket over a period of 12 months
</br>

### Questions to be answered on Low Inflation, using article below
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12196322
</br>

- ##### What exactly is a 'cost of living crisis'?
A cost of living crisis is the fall in 'real' disposable income (income when put in the context of inflation)
- ##### Why is inflation so high at the moment?
There are multiple reasons that inflation is currently very high...
	- Energy bills having risen rapidly because of high oil and gas prices
	- Petrol and diesel prices have also risen, partly due to the war in Ukraine
	- Food prices, also partly caused by rising grain prices due to the Ukraine war
	- Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, household goods and rising costs in the hospitality sector
	- Higher interest rates which cause mortgage rates to increase for homeowners
- ##### What is happening to wages?
Pay increases aren't keeping up with rising prices, leading to a drop in 'real' wages (wages in the context of inflation). However, if wages reflect the cost of living, it is possible that this could drive inflation even higher (according to the government)
- ##### How is the inflation rate calculated?
The Office for National Statistics calculates the inflation rate by keeping track of the increase in the price of hundreds of commonly bought goods. This is known as the basket of goods. This is known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- ##### What can be done to reduce the rate of inflation?
	- Energy Cost Caps
	- Raising interest rates making borrowing money more expensive

</br>

### Full employment
- Full employment means that everyone who is willing and able to work has a job
- In reality, there will always be some unemployment, due to the changing nature of labour markets
- Unemployment is measured by the claimant count - the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits - or the labour force survey - a quarterly survey of households across the UK (50k per quarter approx)
</br>

# Aggregate Demand and Supply

</br>

## Aggregate Demand
</br>
Total demand for good and services produced within the economy over a period of time

AD = Consumption (C) + Investment (I) + Gov. Spending (G)
</br>

### The Aggregate Demand Curve

- The AD curve shows the relationship between the general price level and real GDP
- It is downward sloping because:
	- As prices rise, real incomes fall and consumers are less able to consume
	- As prices rise, the more expensive exports become and foreigners are less able to consume
	- As prices rise, interest rates generally rise and the less consumers are able to borrow (spend) 

![[AD Curve]]
</br>

### The Multiplier

Important terms:
- Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)
- Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)
- Marginal Propensity to Tax (MPT)
- Marginal Propensity to Import (MPI)

Combined, MPS, MPT and MPI sum to MPW
</br>

- The multiplier process is the idea that an increase in AD because of an increased injection can lead to a further increase in national income
- The figure multiplied by the original injection to find the final change in income: $$Multiplier = \frac{1}{(1-MPC)} = \frac{1}{MPW}$$
</br>

## Aggregate Supply

</br>

### Short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)

Short run aggregate supply is the level of output firms would be willing to supply in the short run at any given price level

In the short run, firms have very little flexibility in changing their factors of production. Therefore, the cost of producing extra nits of output increases as firms produce more output

#### Factors that shift SRAS

The key factor that causes the SRAS to shift is a change in all firms costs of production. If costs rise then AS shifts inwards, and if costs decrease then AS shifts outwards
</br>

## Intersection

![[AD + SRAS intersection]]


</br>

## Long Run Aggregate Supply

LRAS is the level of output possible if all firms were producing at their productive potential. This can also be called the 'full employment level of output' or Yfe

#### Classical LRAS Curve
</br>

![[LRAS Curve]]

#### Keynesian LRAS Curve
</br>

![[LRAS Keynesian]]

</br>

The LRAS shows us what the economy is capable of producing when all it's factors are working efficiently. If the equilibrium lies to to the left of where the LRAS curve intersects with AD, then this is a negative output gap/deflationary gap. If the equilibrium lies to the right, then it is a positive output gap/inflationary gap.

###### Classical Viewpoint

Classical economists believe that output gaps are only possible in the short run, and that the economy will always return to the full employment level of output. This will happen regardless of the price level and without any intervention from the government.

When a component of AD increases: as prices rise firms find that their costs of production increase leading to an inward shift of SRAS. The economy returns to the full employment level of output but at a higher price level than before.

###### Keynesian Viewpoint

Keynesian economists argue that the economy can rest below full employment, because they don't believe that workers won't necessarily accept lower wages. To fix this, the government needs to intervene to increase AD and get the economy closer to full employment.


</br>

# National Income Statistics

</br>

### Why is it important to measure economic performance?

- Provides a 'report card' to evaluate the health of the economy
- Allows governments to see if they are meeting their targets
- Allows economists to forecast expected growth moving forward
- Acts as an important measure of living standards
- Allows for a comparison against other countries
</br>

### Macroeconomic Indicators
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The total value of national output produced in a given time period
- Gross National Income (GNI): GDP plus net income from overseas
- GDP per capita: Income per head of population
- Nominal GDP: The GDP of a country at current prices
- Real GDP: The GDP of a country at constant prices (after the effects of inflation have been removed)
- Green GDP: The value of national output minus the cost of environmental damage
</br>

### Index Numbers
- Changes in macro indicators are usually measured using index numbers
- We use index numbers to make comparisons over periods of time
- An index start in a given year - called the base year - which is given an index of 100
- In later years an increase in the indicator causes the index to rise above 100, while a fall leads to a reduction from 100 (so a 5% rise gives an index of 105, and a 5% fall gives an index of 95)
</br>




# The Circular Flow of Income

![[Attachments/output-onlinepngtools.png]]
If J = W then the economy is in equilibrium
If J > W then national income rises
If J < W then national income falls


</br>

# Economic Cycle

The economic cycle is when GDP growth fluctuates around the trend or underlying growth rate.
</br>

## The Four Stages
</br>

### 1) Boom

Output (GDP) rises strongly and unemployment falls (maybe close to full employment). Inflation at or above target.

### 2) Slowdown

Output is rising but at a slower rate. Unemployment rate stops falling. Disinflation may occur.

### 3) Recession

Output falls over two successive quarters. Rising unemployment. Disinflation or possible deflation.

### 4) Recovery

Output starts to rise again. Unemployment peaks. Return of inflation.
