# Monopoly

</br>

A monopoly is a dominant seller of a good or service in a market. Monopolies are usually defined according to their market share:

- $>$ 25% = ‘legal’ or ‘working’ monopoly
- $>$ $40% = ‘dominant’ monopoly
- Two firms with > 80% market share combined = duopoly

A natural monopoly is a market that can only support one supplier due to the massive fixed costs involved (e.g. water companies)

</br>


### Assumptions of monopoly

- One dominant supplier
- Very different products
- Very limited information
- High barriers to entry - no hit and run tactics
- Price makers - large degree of flexibility - inelastic demand, few substitutes, brand loyalty

</br>

### Long-run monopoly

- In the long run, a monopoly will always be able to profit maximise
- Abnormal (supernormal) profit will be made and sustained, because significant barriers to entry exist

</br>

### Efficiency

- A monopoly is productive inefficient - it doesn’t produce at AC = MC
- It is also allocatively inefficient - it doesn’t produce at P = MC. This leads to deadweight loss
- However, a monopoly can be dynamically efficient - abnormal profits can lead to research and development, which leads to lower costs and/or better quality products

</br>

### Natural monopoly

- A natural monopoly occurs in markets where the fixed costs of production are very large but the marginal costs are very small
- The first firm enjoys a cost advantage as it is able to exploit economies of scale throughout its output range
- As extra users are added, ATC continues to fall
- As a result, the market can only support one firm (any more would be inefficient and a waste of resources)
