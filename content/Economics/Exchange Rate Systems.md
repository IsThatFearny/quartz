# Exchange Rate Systems

- An exchange rate is the value of one currency expressed in terms of another.
- Currencies are traded in foreign exchange markets and the volume of money bought and sold is huge.

</br>

### Methods of conversion

- To convert £ into a foreign currency: multiply the figure in £s by the exchange rate.
- To convert a foreign currency into £s: Divide the foreign currency by the £s exchange rate.

</br>

### Floating exchange rates

The value of a currency is determined by demand for and supply of the currency in the foreign exchange market.

It is not used to support macroeconomic policy.

There are no government/central bank controls over how much foreign currency can be bought and sold - no attempt to influence exchange rates.

</br>

### Depreciation

The sustained decrease in the value of one currency in terms of another

</br>

### Appreciation

The sustained increase in the value of one currency in terms of another

</br>

### Demand factors

- Demand for exports
- Rising domestic interest rate
- Speculation
- Long-term capital inflow

### Supply factors

- Demand for imports
- Rising overseas interest rate
- Speculation
- Long-term capital outflow

</br>

### Disadvantages of floating exchange rates

- Uncertainty for business when determining future costs and revenues
- May not naturally self adjust to reduce current account deficit
- May make inflation worse

</br>

### Fixed Exchange Rate Systems

- A country seeks to keep their currency fixed against another
- The central bank must hold enough foreign currency reserves to intervene in currency markets
- Usually fixed against the euro or the US dollar
- Reduces uncertainty

</br>

#### Devaluation and Revaluation of a currency

- Devaluation is when the price of a currency is officially and deliberately lowered, revaluation is the opposite
- The international competitiveness of a country can be improved by a currency devaluation - exports are relatively cheaper and imports become more expensive

</br>

The value of the currency in a fixed system is still determined by demand and supply. However, the central bank needs to match the changes in supply or demand in order to keep at the fixed rate.

</br>

#### How to influence an exchange rate

- Buying and selling currency
	- To increase value, a central bank will buy its own currency in exchange for foreign currencies
	- To decrease value, a central bank will sell its own currency
- Change interest rates - hot money flows
	- To revalue, the central bank will increase interest rates
	- To devalue, the central bank will decrease interest rates
- Currency controls
	- Limits on the amount of foreign currency that can be bought - businesses wanting to import would have to buy from central bank
- Borrowing from IMF
	- Money borrowed to buy up currency to maintain a high exchange rate - sign of economic failure
</br>

#### Example

The Chinese Government will ‘fix’ the value of the RMB against the dollar to devalue their currency.

- An increase in the demand for Chinese exports leads to an increase in demand for the RMB
- This leads to an appreciation of the RMB and potential loss of competitiveness

</br>

#### Advantages of fixed exchange rates

- Reduces uncertainty - helps to encourage investment
- Incentive to keep inflation low - government policy forced to be sensible
- Reduces speculation

#### Disadvantages of fixed exchange rates

- Manipulating interest rates to control exchange rates has negative impact on the economy
