### Using a demand and supply diagram, explain why oversupply has caused a fall in prices in the lithium market

An oversupply in Lithium causes a decrease in prices in the market because as supply increases, price decreases, as shown in the diagram below. An outward shift in the supply curve from S1 to S2 will cause a decrease in price from P1 to P2. This occurs because supply outstrips demand, and firms are incentivised to sell left-over stock, which may only be bought at this new, lower price.

### Using the concept of price elasticity of supply, explain why commodity markets, such as the lithium market, often have volatile prices

The price elasticity of demand for commodities such as Lithium is rather price inelastic, because they are essential to certain goods, such as electric cars. This means that, no matter the price, the demand will change very little. The diagram below demonstrates this elasticity - the reduction in quantity from Q1 to Q1 is less than directly proportional to the increase in price from P1 to P2.
