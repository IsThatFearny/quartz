# Gender Pay Gap


</br>





### Why does the gender pay gap exist?

- **Educational differences** - men and women may have different levels of education, especially in the older population (due to a previously lower amount of women getting university degrees)
- **Subject choice** - STEM subjects are more popular amongst men, and these have higher returns in the labour market. This means that there are higher earning when working.
- **Experience** - Having a child can reduce working hours, which reduces experience. It also means that training on the job may be much less, and so accumulation of their human capital is reduced.
- **Discrimination** - discrimination against minority groups, i.e. women, causes pay gaps
- **Traits and preferences** - It is argued that men may have a stronger desire to work, or earn more money. Whether this is contextualised by psychology or by societal pressures, this is still a cause of a pay gap. As well as this, a pre-existing male-dominated workplace culture can cause men to be more likely to be promoted or get a pay rise

### Why does the gender pay gap matter?

- **Income inequality** - the gender pay gap is a form of inequality. Increasing female earnings can have a number of both private and public benefits, such as increased pay for the individual, and an incentive to enter the labour market in the wider industry. Women may also increase their investment in education if they know that there are higher returns to be found in the labour market
- **Bargaining power** - a gender pay gap can cause a power imbalance in society between men and women, e.g. in childcare, spending of household income, etc.

### What can be done about it?

- **Education and transparency** - Encouraging women into STEM subjects, and encouraging men to study subjects with low male participation will help to break down stereotypes and prevent a pay gap in future. Ensuring that firms are transparent about their pay gaps is also important, as it allows us to hold firms to account and prevent the exacerbation of the gender pay gap
- **Childcare and parental leave** - Introducing free/subsidies childcare may encourage women into jobs and prevent the power imbalance that arises. However, this is simply a substitution effect, and so the impact of this policy is dependent on current usage and policy design. Maternity and Paternity leave are also policy instruments that can be used: more emphasis on paternity leave may help to address the imbalance in the workplace
- **Quotas** - Enforcing a quota for gender ratios, such as in Belgium, where Executive Boards must have a ratio of between 1:3 and 2:3 in terms of gender proportions. Positive discrimination.
