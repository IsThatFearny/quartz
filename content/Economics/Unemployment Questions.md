# Unemployment Questions

</br>

## Explain how unemployment is measured in the UK

In the UK, the unemployment rate is measured in two ways: the Claimant Count (JSA/Universal Credit), and the Labour Force Survey (LFS). LFS is more commonly used as it is more reliable and surveys a much larger amount of people (not everyone who is unemployed claims benefits).

## Explain what has happened to the UK unemployment rate since the 2008 financial crash

In 2008, when the markets crashed, unemployment spiked to approx. 7.5%. It then remained fairly constant until 2012, where is spiked slightly to around 8.5%. After this however, it began to decline significantly, falling to 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Due to COVID-19 in 2020, it spiked slightly to 5%, before again falling to 3.5% in the third quarter of 2022.

## Explain why the trend in the number of economically inactive people since the start of the pandemic is a concern for the UK government

Since 2011, the number of economically inactive people has been declining. It took a further dip during the pandemic, where people began to look for jobs more, but after this it rose sharply, and has continued to gradually rise. Rising economic inactivity is an issue for the government, as it reduces AD and hinders economic growth, and also may lead to an increase in the amount of people claiming benefits, which are of course funded by the government, so this will result in an increase in government spending. This will require budget cuts in other areas, or higher taxes, neither of which the (current) government wish to introduce.

## Explain the difference between cyclical and structural unemployment. Which is more serious?

Cyclical unemployment occurs when there is a fall in or weakness of aggregate demand. This results in a decline in real GDP and available jobs. However, this is termed 'cyclical' as it runs in a cycle, and when the 'upturn' and 'boom' phases of the economic cycle begin to occur, cyclical unemployment declines, as AD will increase. 

Structural unemployment occurs when there is a mismatch of skills and job opportunities. This is generally due to changes in the demand for labour. As new technology is introduced, structural unemployment may increase due to technology replacing humans to do certain jobs.

Structural employment is more serious, as it does not occur in a cycle like cyclical employment does. There can be no assumption that structural unemployment will 'fix itself', and therefore governments and firms must step in to solve the problem and create new jobs for those who find themselves redundant.

## Explain two major costs of unemployment. Are there any potential upside to unemployment?

Unemployment can cause increased government spending on benefits and universal credit. it can also reduce the revenue that the government gets from taxation (fewer people in tax brackets eligible for taxation). The social costs of employment are also significant, and it can lead a rise in crime.

However, there may be benefits to unemployment. For example, extra spending caused by an expanding labour market may damage the current account balance. There is also a risk of rapidly rising inflation if unemployment were to fall rapidly. In addition, less spare labour will result in more unfilled jobs, which may decline investment. If unemployment is too low, then these are all significant problems, and so there are some benefits to unemployment remaining slightly higher than full employment.

## Explain how the government can lower unemployment? (One side demand, one side supply)

Demand: Reductions in corporation tax will incentivise investment, which will increase demand for labour

Supply: Stronger work incentives, increasing pay, etc. People are more likely to apply for jobs and become economically active if there is a better incentive for them to work, such as more income.
