# Under-employment questions

</br>

## 1) Why are women more likely than men to be under-employed?

There is a greater proportion of women who stay at home to take care of children (due to the remnants of older societal norms)

</br>

## 2) Assess the advantages and disadvantages of zero-hours employment contracts

Advantages:

- Allows for flexibility for students, part-time workers, etc.
- Allows for flexible employment for employers (e.g. seasonal employment)

Disadvantages:

- Gives all control to the employer
- Staff can be sent home if there is no work to be done
- No guarantee of wages

</br>

## 3) Describe one other cause of low-paid work

Low-education levels leading to more low-skilled workers

</br>

## 4) Should the government make zero-hours contracts illegal? Justify your answer.

Yes, they should. This is because employers have started using them for people who aren't in the groups that benefit from the flexibility, and takes the control out of the workers hands. In addition, some people may not be working enough hours to make a living wage, despite getting paid enough.
