# Aggregate Demand and Supply

</br>

## Aggregate Demand
</br>
Total demand for good and services produced within the economy over a period of time

AD = Consumption (C) + Investment (I) + Gov. Spending (G)
</br>

### The Aggregate Demand Curve

- The AD curve shows the relationship between the general price level and real GDP
- It is downward sloping because:
	- As prices rise, real incomes fall and consumers are less able to consume
	- As prices rise, the more expensive exports become and foreigners are less able to consume
	- As prices rise, interest rates generally rise and the less consumers are able to borrow (spend)

### The Multiplier

Important terms:
- Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)
- Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)
- Marginal Propensity to Tax (MPT)
- Marginal Propensity to Import (MPI)

Combined, MPS, MPT and MPI sum to MPW
</br>

- The multiplier process is the idea that an increase in AD because of an increased injection can lead to a further increase in national income
- The figure multiplied by the original injection to find the final change in income: $$Multiplier = \frac{1}{(1-MPC)} = \frac{1}{MPW}$$
</br>

## Aggregate Supply

</br>

### Short-run aggregate supply (SRAS)

Short run aggregate supply is the level of output firms would be willing to supply in the short run at any given price level

In the short run, firms have very little flexibility in changing their factors of production. Therefore, the cost of producing extra nits of output increases as firms produce more output

#### Factors that shift SRAS

The key factor that causes the SRAS to shift is a change in all firms costs of production. If costs rise then AS shifts inwards, and if costs decrease then AS shifts outwards
</br>

## Intersection

## Long Run Aggregate Supply

LRAS is the level of output possible if all firms were producing at their productive potential. This can also be called the 'full employment level of output' or Yfe

#### Classical LRAS Curve

#### Keynesian LRAS Curve
</br>

</br>

The LRAS shows us what the economy is capable of producing when all it's factors are working efficiently. If the equilibrium lies to to the left of where the LRAS curve intersects with AD, then this is a negative output gap/deflationary gap. If the equilibrium lies to the right, then it is a positive output gap/inflationary gap.

###### Classical Viewpoint

Classical economists believe that output gaps are only possible in the short run, and that the economy will always return to the full employment level of output. This will happen regardless of the price level and without any intervention from the government.

When a component of AD increases: as prices rise firms find that their costs of production increase leading to an inward shift of SRAS. The economy returns to the full employment level of output but at a higher price level than before.

###### Keynesian Viewpoint

Keynesian economists argue that the economy can rest below full employment, because they don't believe that workers won't necessarily accept lower wages. To fix this, the government needs to intervene to increase AD and get the economy closer to full employment.
