# National Income Statistics

</br>

### Why is it important to measure economic performance?

- Provides a 'report card' to evaluate the health of the economy
- Allows governments to see if they are meeting their targets
- Allows economists to forecast expected growth moving forward
- Acts as an important measure of living standards
- Allows for a comparison against other countries
</br>

### Macroeconomic Indicators
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The total value of national output produced in a given time period
- Gross National Income (GNI): GDP plus net income from overseas
- GDP per capita: Income per head of population
- Nominal GDP: The GDP of a country at current prices
- Real GDP: The GDP of a country at constant prices (after the effects of inflation have been removed)
- Green GDP: The value of national output minus the cost of environmental damage
</br>

### Index Numbers
- Changes in macro indicators are usually measured using index numbers
- We use index numbers to make comparisons over periods of time
- An index start in a given year - called the base year - which is given an index of 100
- In later years an increase in the indicator causes the index to rise above 100, while a fall leads to a reduction from 100 (so a 5% rise gives an index of 105, and a 5% fall gives an index of 95)
