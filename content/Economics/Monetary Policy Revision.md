#### **Forward Guidance**

When the Central Bank announces to markets that it intends to keep interest rates at a certain level until a fixed point in the future.

</br>

#### **Funding for Lending (2012-2018)**

A scheme to boost bank lending. Commercial banks were able to borrow even more cheaply from the Bank of England, which allowed them to give cheap loans for firms and consumers

</br>

#### **Quantitative Easing - Asset Purchase**

Quantitative Easing is used to stimulate AD - loose monetary policy.





**Background**

*Bonds* are IOUs that pay an amount of interest that is fixed in cash terms - £5 per year, for example.

The *coupon* is the amount of interest that is applied to the nominal value of the bond.

The *yield* is the annual interest payment expressed as a percentage of the market price of the bond.

$Yield = \frac{Coupon}{Market Price} \times 100$

**What is Quantitative Easing?**

- Quantitative Easing is one of two tools used to change interest
- Used when interest rates are already very low
- Involves buying bonds to push up their price and bring down long term interest rates
- It supports the prices of other financial assets such as shares

**How does it work?**

- As the bond prices rise, the yield drops
