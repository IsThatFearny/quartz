# Financial Issues and Regulation

</br>





### Financial Instability

Financial instability is a disturbance to financial markets, associated typically with falling asset prices and insolvency amongst debtors and intermediaries, which ramifies through the financial system, disrupting the market’s capacity to allocate capital.

### Issues in Banking

#### Borrowing short and lending long

- ‘Borrowing short’ is when banks raise capital by taking deposits that must be available on short notice
- ‘Lending long’ is when banks loan out money which won’t be available to them for a long time





Banks will be affected if there are interest rate changes.

#### Liquidity and Capital Ratios

A bank may fail if they do not have sufficient capital and liquidity.





**Capital ratios** - a bank must maintain sufficient capital to act as a reserve

$Capital\ Ratio = \frac {Total\ Capital}{Total\ Assets}$

A **Liquidity ratio** is the ratio of liquid assets held by a bank on their balance sheet to their overall assets. Banks need to hold enough to cover expected demands from depositors. A high liquidity ratio may limit the amount of lending that a bank is able to do - it must maintain higher amounts of cash.

$Liquidity\ Ratio = \frac{Total\ Liquid\ Assets}{Total\ Liabilites}$

</br>

#### Moral Hazard

A moral hazard is when someone is more willing to take risks because they know someone else will have to pay the consequences if anything goes wrong.





E.g. a firm selling sub-prime loans may know that the people taking out the loan are liable to default, but if they know the government will bail them out they will take the risk.

</br>

#### Systemic Risk

The risk that an event in one part of the financial system (e.g. in one bank) will trigger a chain reaction, leading to a widespread failure of the financial system.





**Why does systemic risk occur?**

- Interconnectedness
- Complexity of financial markets - the financial system is becoming increasingly complex, with a large number of different financial products and markets
- Complex regulations making it difficult to identify risks

</br>

#### Market Bubbles

Speculation means aiming to make a profit by buying assets cheaply, and selling them at a higher price - this carries risk.





Investors that overestimate the rise of future asset prices cause market bubbles (prices greater than an asset’s true worth).

When investors lose confidence, the bubble bursts: investors rush to sell assets and prices plummet as a result, leaving large debts and worthless assets.

</br>

#### Market Rigging

Collusion amongst traders or financial institutions can lead to higher profits at the expense of others. For instance, banks may attempt to operate an interest rate cartel, so that interest rates ti savers are lower, and to borrowers higher than would be the case in a more competitive market.





Another form of market rigging is insider trading. This is where individuals with privileged information use it to make a profit at the expense of others who do not have access to the information. For instance, if a company director knows that his firm is going to announce a big fall in profits they may sell them before the price falls, creating a disadvantage to the buyer.

### Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)

The PRA is part of the Bank of England. It is responsible for *micro*prudential management of banks, building societies, credit unions, insurers and major investment firms. It sets standards for and supervises financial institutions. For example, they may require individual institutions to maintain specified capital and liquidity ratios to ensure that, in the case that a firm fails, it will do so in a way that avoids disruption to the financial system.





</br>

### Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)

The FCA aims to: protect consumers by ensuring an adequate degree of protection; protect financial markets to enhance the integrity of the financial system; promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.





</br>

### Financial Policy Committee (FPC)

The FPC is the part of the Bank of England which is responsible for maintaining financial stability. They are responsible for *macro*prudential regulation, which is concerned with identifying, monitoring, and acting to remove risks to the financial system.
