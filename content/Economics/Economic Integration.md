# Economic Integration

</br>

Economic integration is the process of countries becoming more interdependent and economically unified.


![[Economic-Integration.webp]]

</br>

### Bi-lateral trade agreement

A bi-lateral trade agreement is an agreement between two countries, which removes barriers to trade.

### Regional trade agreement

A reciprocal trade agreement between two or more countries, which allows for freer market and fairer trade.

### Multilateral trade agreement

A legally binding preferential trade agreement between more than two countries, under the guidelines of the World Trade Organisation.
</br>
## Levels of Economic Integration
</br>

### Trading blocs

A group of countries that join together in some form of agreement to increase trade/gain economic benefit from cooperation.

### Free trade area

Free trade amongst members, however each country can trade with countries outside of the free trade area however they wish

### Customs union

Free trade amongst members. All members adopt a *common external tariff*. Revenues from import tariffs are combined

### Common Market

A customs union with policies on product regulation and free movement of factors of production

</br>

## Trade creation/diversion

Trade creation and trade diversion are two concepts in international trade theory that describe the impact of economic integration on trade patterns

### Trade creation

Trade creation occurs when the formation of a free trade area or a customs union leads to an increase in trade between member countries, resulting in overall economic benefits for the group.

#### Example: Croatia joins the EU
![[Customs Union Benefits Diagram|1000x500]]
##### Before Croatia joins a trading bloc: 

- Croatia faces paying a tariff on imported goods - higher prices/lack of choice
- Domestic firms produce inefficiently due to a lack of tariff free competition 

##### After Croatia joins a trading bloc:

- Level of imports increases - increase in choice
- Price falls for Croatian consumers - increasing consumer surplus - see diagram
- Domestic production falls - loss of inefficiency - see diagram

</br>

#### Advantages of membership of a trading bloc

- Greater size of market
- Increased competition leading to greater efficiency
- Stimulus for investment
- Greater employment opportunities
- Fosters political stability and cooperation

#### Disadvantages of membership of a trading bloc

- Loss of  sovereignty - loss of economic independence
- Trade agreements can be challenging and take time

</br>

### Trade diversion

Trade diversion is an economic term in which trade is diverted from a more efficient exporter towards a less efficient one by the formation of a free trade agreement or a customs union.

This can lead to higher costs for producers and higher prices for consumers if previously they had access to a lower cost/lower price supply from a non-union country


#### Example: Croatia joins the EU

Before joining the EU, Croatia traded with Bosnia who had comparative advantage - lower prices for consumers.

After joining the EU, Croatia becomes part of a common external tariff (CET) which will make products imported from Bosnia too expensive. Imports from the EU are more expensive than they would have been from Bosnia as they are produced by less efficient firms - they do not have a comparative advantage.

##### Issues

- Loss of consumer surplus
- Loss of domestic efficiency
- Loss of EU efficiency

</br>

### Monetary Union

A monetary union is a system in a common market that requires the convergence of monetary policy that is governed by a central bank.

An optimal currency area is a geographical region where it is thought a single currency would help to maximise welfare and enhance macroeconomic performance. A currency union works best with a small cluster of highly integrated and similar countries, for example Germany, the Netherlands and Austria.

#### Advantages

- Exchange rate certainty increasing trade - eliminates risk of exchange rate fluctuations affecting international trade.
- Increased cross border investments - increased FDI due to currency certainty
- Lower transaction costs
- Price transparency - prices of goods and services can easily compared

#### Disadvantages

- Loss of economic sovereignty - freedom to adjust macro policies is constrained
- Loss of exchange rate flexibility - cannot depreciate own currency if a country needs to stimulate the economy
- One size policy does not suit all countries
- Changeover costs are high
