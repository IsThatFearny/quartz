# Environmental Economics

In a free market, a producer will have little direct incentive to control pollution/take car of environment because it is external, i.e. the profit-maximising supplier considers only his/her own private costs and benefits.

### Environmental Market Failure

#### Common Access Resources

- They are not owned by anyone
- They do not have a price
- They are available for everyone to use without payment

Common access resources are a type of market-failure. They are rivalrous and non-excludable

#### Sustainability

The ability of something to be maintained or preserved over time. There is a need for the joint preservation of the environment and the economy.

There is a conflict between economic and environmental goals

#### The Tragedy of the Commons

The idea that people acting in their own self-interest will overuse a common resource , leading to the depletion or degradation of that resource. Individuals will ignore the external costs borne by others.

#### Property Rights

The absence of property rights can result in production and consumption externalities

### Government intervention to reduce environmental market failure

#### Extending property rights

Governments can grant property rights over scarce resources in an attempt to protect them from misuse and overuse. Allocating property rights will encourage the appointed owners to protect the resource by allowing the owners to sue those who exploit the resource. It will allow owners to sue polluters.

However, it might be difficult for the UK government to extend property rights. Additionally, externalities can be created in another country that impact the UK - we have no power over this. There are also problems with tracing the source of the environmental damage, and suing to protect property rights can be expensive. 

#### Tradeable Pollution Permits

- Market orientated - pollution is given a value
- Government/EU sets optimal level of pollution
- Firms receive or buy emission allowances
- These can be traded
- Firms are fined if they exceed allowances

![[Demand and Supply Pollution Permits]]

An increase in the price of permits should signal to firms to change their polluting behaviour.

#### Taxation of environmental damage

Designed to promote environmentally positive behaviour, reducing the damaging effects on the environment and generate revenue.

It is difficult to place an accurate value on externalities, and target reductions may be difficult to achieve as behaviour of firms and consumers cannot be guaranteed. If demand for a product is inelastic, this may raise good revenue but have little impact on demand. A tax may also be regressive and so affect distribution of income. Finally, an increase in taxes ay reduce international competitiveness.

- Lack of property rights
- Information failure
- Externalities
- High fixed costs of boats - need a large catch to cover these

The UK government use the quota system to control how many fish can be taken from the sea. It does this by dividing up the right to catch fish between a limited number of companies, and then allowing this right to be bought and sold
