# Individual Economic Decision Making

</br>

## Utility Theory
Utility is a measure of the satisfaction that we get from purchasing and consuming a good or service

A lot of economic theory is based on the assumption that people make decisions based upon, marginal changes

- Total Utility - Overall benefit from consuming a good
- Marginal Utility - Benefit gained from consuming one additional unit of a good
- Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility - For each additional unit of a good consumed, the Marginal Utility gained decreases
</br>
## Marginal Utility

Here is an example of Marginal Utility:

| Jam Doughnuts | Total Utility | Marginal Utility |

|             0 |             0 |                0 |
|             1 |             8 |                8 |
|             2 |            14 |                6 |

|             5 |            20 |                0 |
|             6 |            18 |               -2 |

## Economic Agents

- Economic agents are assumed to be utility maximisers
- In order to do this we must act rationally 
- A rational consumer will choose to consume a good where Marginal Utility = Price
</br>

## Rational Consumer Choice

- Homo Economicus - The Economic Man
	- Rational
	- Self Interested
	- Utility Maximiser
	- Perfect Knowledge
	- Calculating the options
	- Insatiable wants

Rational behaviour is 'acting in pursuit of self interest, which for a consumer means attempting to maximise the welfare, satisfaction or utility gained from the goods and services consumed'

Behavioural economists argue that individuals have limits on their self control - they have 'bounded self control'

Biases stop individuals acting in an economically rational way

Behavioural economists believe that individuals are influenced by biases which affect their decision making
</br>

### Bounded Rationality
Decisions are limited by:
- The amount of information available
- Finite amount of time
- Limited mental processing

### Imperfect Information/Information Failure
The price mechanism will only allocate resources efficiently if consumers/producers enjoy perfect information.

Utility will only be maximised if behaviour is rational and people hold correct information on which to base their decisions.

### Asymmetric Information
Either the buyer or seller possess more information than the other party. This leads to a situation of imperfect information

e.g. Second hand cars
The market for second hand cars is affected due to asymmetric inforomation. Some dealers sell good cars (peaches) and some dealers sell dodgy cars (lemons). The customer has no way in knowing which is which. The buyer may offer a lower price for a car as they are unsure of its value. The owners of 'lemons' would accept the offer, but the owners of 'peaches' would not. This affects the market for second hand cars.

### Cognitive Biases
Decisions people make when making choices are often heavily biased. This is because decisions are made on the basis of our likes/dislikes and past experiences.

#### Rule of Thumb/Heuristics
- A guideline - simplified advice
- A mental shortcut
- Allows us to solve problems quickly
- Helps you to make a 'good enough' choice (Satisficing)

#### Anchoring Bias
- Occurs when people only compare and contrast a limited set of items
- Consumers rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the 'anchor')

#### Availability Bias
Individuals place too much weight on the probability of an event happening because they recall vivid examples of similar events

#### Social Norms
These form patterns of behaviour considered acceptable by a society or group

#### Altruism
Humans behaving with more kindness and fairness than would be the case if they behaved rationally

Altruism is often linked to the concept of inequity aversion i.e humans do not like unequal outcomes

</br>

## Behavioural Economics and economic policy
</br>

### Choice Architecture
The practise of influencing choice by changing the manner in which options are presented to people 
</br>

#### Nudges
Factors which encourage people to think and act in particular ways - an attempt to shift behaviour to meet/move away from social norms

Behavioural nudges are an alternative to using taxes and subsidies to influence choices and many have been or are applied in public policy-making both in the UK and in a growing number of countries

</br>

#### Framing
The context in which information is presented can influence a decision. Changing wording can make an option more desirable. Focuses on the gain/loss option for consumers from a decision.

Studies suggest that framing a choice in a positive way is more likely to influence decisions
</br>

#### Choices
- Default choice - an option that is selected automatically unless an alternative is specified
- Restricted choice - Restricting the number of available choices may be more likely to cause consumers to act and actually make a decision, resulting in a more efficient outcome
- Mandated choice - People must make a decision in advance with respect to whether they wish to participate in a particular action - they are required by law to make that choice
</br>

#### Real world examples
- Pension
	- Regular income paid by a government or a financial organisation to someone who no longer, usually because of their age or health
	- Very complex
	- Involves trade-offs between the present and the future
	- Requires assessing risk and uncertainty (availability bias)
	- Decisions can be emotional - not weighing up costs and benefits
