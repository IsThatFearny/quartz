# Individual Economic Decision Making

</br>

## Utility Theory
Utility is a measure of the satisfaction that we get from purchasing and consuming a good or service

A lot of economic theory is based on the assumption that people make decisions based upon, marginal changes

- Total Utility - Overall benefit from consuming a good
- Marginal Utility - Benefit gained from consuming one additional unit of a good
- Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility - For each additional unit of a good consumed, the Marginal Utility gained decreases
</br>
## Marginal Utility

Here is an example of Marginal Utility:
</br>

| Jam Doughnuts | Total Utility | Marginal Utility |
|:--------------|:--------------|:-----------------|
|             0 |             0 |                0 |
|             1 |             8 |                8 |
|             2 |            14 |                6 |
|             3 |            18 |                4 |
|             4 |            20 |                2 |
|             5 |            20 |                0 |
|             6 |            18 |               -2 |

## Economic Agents

- Economic agents are assumed to be utility maximisers
- In order to do this we must act rationally 
- A rational consumer will choose to consume a good where Marginal Utility = Price
</br>

## Rational Consumer Choice

- Homo Economics - The Economic Man
	- Rational
	- Self Interested
	- Utility Maximiser
	- Perfect Knowledge
	- Calculating the options
	- Insatiable wants

Rational behaviour is 'acting in pursuit of self interest, which for a consumer means attempting to maximise the welfare, satisfaction or utility gained from the goods and services consumed'

Behavioural economists argue that individuals have limits on their self control - they have 'bounded self control'

Biases stop individuals acting in an economically rational way

Behavioural economists believe that individuals are influenced by biases which affect their decision making
</br>

### Bounded Rationality
Decisions are limited by:
- The amount of information available
- Finite amount of time
- Limited mental processing

### Imperfect Information/Information Failure
The price mechanism will only allocate resources efficiently if consumers/producers enjoy perfect information.

Utility will only be maximised if behaviour is rational and people hold correct information on which to base their decisions.

### Asymmetric Information
Either the buyer or seller possess more information than the other party. This leads to a situation of imperfect information

e.g. Second hand cars
The market for second hand cars is affected due to asymmetric inforomation. Some dealers sell good cars (peaches) and some dealers sell dodgy cars (lemons). The customer has no way in knowing which is which. The buyer may offer a lower price for a car as they are unsure of its value. The owners of 'lemons' would accept the offer, but the owners of 'peaches' would not. This affects the market for second hand cars.

### Cognitive Biases
Decisions people make when making choices are often heavily biased. This is because decisions are made on the basis of our likes/dislikes and past experiences.

#### Rule of Thumb/Heuristics
- A guideline - simplified advice
- A mental shortcut
- Allows us to solve problems quickly
- Helps you to make a 'good enough' choice (Satisficing)

#### Anchoring Bias
- Occurs when people only compare and contrast a limited set of items
- Consumers rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the 'anchor')

#### Availability Bias
Individuals place too much weight on the probability of an event happening because they recall vivid examples of similar events

#### Social Norms
These form patterns of behaviour considered acceptable by a society or group

#### Altruism
Humans behaving with more kindness and fairness than would be the case if they behaved rationally

Altruism is often linked to the concept of inequity aversion i.e humans do not like unequal outcomes

</br>

## Behavioural Economics and economic policy
</br>

### Choice Architecture
The practise of influencing choice by changing the manner in which options are presented to people 
</br>

#### Nudges
Factors which encourage people to think and act in particular ways - an attempt to shift behaviour to meet/move away from social norms

Behavioural nudges are an alternative to using taxes and subsidies to influence choices and many have been or are applied in public policy-making both in the UK and in a growing number of countries

</br>

#### Framing
The context in which information is presented can influence a decision. Changing wording can make an option more desirable. Focuses on the gain/loss option for consumers from a decision.

Studies suggest that framing a choice in a positive way is more likely to influence decisions
</br>

#### Choices
- Default choice - an option that is selected automatically unless an alternative is specified
- Restricted choice - Restricting the number of available choices may be more likely to cause consumers to act and actually make a decision, resulting in a more efficient outcome
- Mandated choice - People must make a decision in advance with respect to whether they wish to participate in a particular action - they are required by law to make that choice
</br>

#### Real world examples
- Pension
	- Regular income paid by a government or a financial organisation to someone who no longer, usually because of their age or health
	- Very complex
	- Involves trade-offs between the present and the future
	- Requires assessing risk and uncertainty (availability bias)
	- Decisions can be emotional - not weighing up costs and benefits

# Economic Methodology and the Economic Problem

</br>

## Economics Overview

</br>

### Economics is the study of scarcity

> "Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends (unlimited wants) and scarce means (resources) which have alternative uses"
> ~ Lionel Robbins
> 

</br>

### Economics is a [[Economics/Glossary#Social Science|Social Science]]

A social science is the scientific study of human society and social relationships

</br>

### How is Economics similar to science?

1) Uses theories and models to understand Economic forces and events
2) Uses statistical data to prove a hypothesis
3) Organising Experiments to test theories

### How is it different?

1) Does not tend to use experiments to confirm ideas
2) Relies on observations of real life events in order to confirm hypothesis


</br>

## How does Economics approach the world?

</br>

### [[Economics/Glossary#Positive Economics|Positive Economics]] (Objective)

The study of *what is* and the way the world actually works. Can be tested and are statements that are provable, e.g. 'A tax on plastic carrier bags will reduce the volume of plastic waste'

</br>

### [[Economics/Glossary#Normative Economics|Normative Economics]] (Subjective)

Matters of opinion and reflect value judgements. Statement of opinion, although can be tested by facts, e.g. 'the government should increase the minimum wage to Â£15 per hour to reduce poverty'

</br>

### [[Economics/Glossary#Value Judgements|Value Judgements]]

Beliefs of individuals and societies about what is right or wrong, good or bad
</br>

### Economics and politics

Politicians will make decisions based on: 

- The views of the electorate
- Actions of pressure groups
- Views of individual politicians
- Media reports

</br>

### The Purpose of Economic Activity

The central purpose of economic activity is the production of goods and services to satisfy needs and wants. A need is something that we require to  survive (food, water, shelter, etc), whereas a want is something that would improve our lives (luxuries such as technology, nicer houses, etc.) Satisfying needs and wants means improving *economic welfare*
</br>

### [[Economics/Glossary#Economic Welfare|Economic Welfare]]

The economic well being of an individual or group within an economy
</br>
</br>


## The Economic Problem

The resources used to produce these goods and services are finite. The economic problem is about how to allocate our scarce resources when *wants are infinite*
</br>

### The Basic Economic Problem

- *What should we produce* using the factors of production at our disposal?
- *How should we produce it* given the factors of production you have access to?
- *For whom should we produce?* Who should have access to the goods and services provided

</br>

### Factors of Production

Factors of production are inputs into the production process.

-   Land - minerals, ocean, agricultural land
-   Labour - workforce
-   Capital - machinery, technology
-   Entrepreneurs  
</br>

### How might factors of production be improved to increase productivity or quantity?

-   Land - Land reclaiming, intensive farming/fishing, vertical farming, crop cycle
-   Labour - Motivation, incentive, 'happier workers are harder workers'
-   Capital - Developments in technology, purpose-made machines
-   Entrepreneurs - Higher profit for less risk, more gain from investments, subsidise small businesses  
</br>

### Rewards for factors of production
- Labour - Wages
- Land - Rent
- Enterprise - Profit
- Capital - Interest
</br>

### The environment is a scarce resource
- Renewable - Availability depends on management by humans
- Non renewable - Availability is limited

</br>

### Opportunity Cost
This is a theory that relates to the idea of scarcity. The opportunity cost of any choice or decision is measured in terms of the alternatives that have to be given up. 'The next best alternative forgone'

### Free and economic goods
A free good is a good with zero opportunity cost. This means it can be produced by society in as much quantities as needed with little or zero effort. 

An economic good is a good or service that has a benefit (utility) to society. Economic goods have a degree of scarcity and therefore opportunity cost.

</br>
</br>

## The means of answering the economic questions
</br>

### Economic Systems
The way in which an economy is organised and run, including alternative views on how resources are best allocated
</br>

### Command Economy
- Scarce resources owned by government
- Price mechanism plays little part
</br>

### Free Market
- Resources allocated by price
- Limited role for government
- Protection of property rights
</br>

### Economic Modelling - Opportunity Cost

#### Production Possibility Curve/Frontier

A PPC/F is 'a diagrammatic representation of the maximum combination of 2 products that an economy can produce when all of its resources are used efficiently in a time period'

![[PPC Graph]]

By increasing the production of guns, this country has to decrease the production of wheat.

##### Assumptions

1) Fixed Production - Only two products are made in varying combinations. It is a simplified version of real world markets
2) Scarcity - Limited and fixed amount of resources in an economy at any moment in time - there is a trade off between the 2 products
3) Constant State of Technology - Technology is held constant - in reality this would change
5) Efficiency - Resources are used in an efficient way - no waste. maximum physical output is produced

##### How can PPC's be used?

- To find opportunity cost
- To show scarcity
- Unemployment of resources
- To show efficiency

##### Constant Opportunity Cost
- A linear PPC suggests constant opportunity cost
- This is less realistic

# Price Determination in a Competitive Market
</br>

## Demand Theory

![[Market Demand Curve]]

</br>

###### Demand

The quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to buy at a given price in a given period of time

###### Effective Demand

Desire backed up by a willingness and ability to pay

###### Law of Demand

As a good's price falls, more is demanded
</br>

### Changes in price and their impact on demand


![[Extension and Contraction of Demand]]

#### Factors that shift demand

![[Factors that shift the demand curve]]

This graph shows the demand curve for an object

D is the normal demand curve

D2 is a decrease in demand (shift to the left)

D1 is an increase in demand (shift to the right)

</br>

### Ceteris Paribus

All other factors remaining constant (Assumptions made when drawing single demand)

Breaking it causes shifts in the curves
</br>

## Supply Theory
</br>

Supply: The willingness and ability of producers to supply output onto a market at a given price in a given period of time
</br>

### The Law of Supply

As the price of a product rises the quantity supplied of the product will usually increase

![[Supply Curve]]

![[Supply Curve (With Contraction and Extension)]]

![[Shifts of Supply]]

Rightward Shift - Increase in supply at each and every price
Leftward shift - Decrease in supply at each and every price

</br>

## Determination of equilibrium prices

The equilibrium is the price at which demand is equal to supply and there is no tendency for change.

The price in market equilibrium is the equilibrium price and the quantity is the equilibrium quantity. This is also known as the market clearing price.


![[Excalidraw/Determination of equilibrium prices]]

</br>

## Microeconomic Disequilibrium

</br>

### Excess Demand

This is when consumers wish to buy more than firms wish to sell, with the price below the equilibrium price

### Excess Supply

This is when firms wish to see more than consumers wish to buy, with the price being above the equilibrium level

![[Excess Supply and Demand Curve]]

### Consumer Surplus

This is a measure of the welfare that people gain from consuming goods and services. There is a gain to buyers who can purchased a product at a lower price than they are willing and able to pay

### Producer Surplus

This is a measure of producer welfare. There is a gain to firms that receive a price higher than the price they are willing and able to supply at

</br>

### Inter relationships between markets

A change in one market can cause a change in the other


</br>

# Price Elasticity of Demand and Supply

</br>

## Elasticity of Demand

Price Elasticity is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity of a good demanded to a change in it's price.

Elastic Demand: A change in price leads to a larger proportionate change in quantity demanded

Inelastic Demand: A change in price leads to a smaller proportionate change in quantity demanded


Formula: $$\frac{Percentage\:Change\:in\: quantity\: demanded}{Percentage\:Change\:in\: Price}$$

### Elasticity in diagrams
</br>

#### Relatively elastic demand 

QD changes by a larger % than P

![[Relatively Elastic Demand Curve]]

</br>

#### Perfectly elastic demand

Buyers prepared to buy all they can at some given price but none at all at a higher or lower price.

![[Perfect Elastic Demand Curve]]

</br>

#### Perfectly inelastic demand

QD does not change as P changes

![[Perfectly Inelastic Demand Curve]]

</br>

#### Relatively inelastic demand

QD changes by a smaller % than P

![[Relatively Inelastic Demand Curve]]

</br>

#### Unitary Demand

Change in QD = Change in P

![[Unitary Elasticity Curve]]

</br>

### Total Revenue
</br>

![[Price Elasticity of Demand 2022-11-30 10.29.29]]

###### Relatively Inelastic

Original Total Revenue = 40 x 40 = 1600

New Total Revenue (On Price Increase) = 60 x 35 = 2100

Increase of 500 units.

###### Relatively Elastic

Original Total Revenue = 40 x 100 = 4,000

New Total Revenue (On Price Increase) = 60 x 45 = 2700

Decrease of 1,300 units

</br>

#### Inelastic Demand

If a good has inelastic demand then:

- A reduction in price will reduce the firm's total revenue
- An increase in price will increase the firm's total revenue
</br>

#### Elastic Demand

If a good has elastic demand then: 

- A reduction in price will increase the firm's total revenue
- An increase in price will decrease the firm's total revenue

</br>

## Elasticity of Supply
</br>

A measure of the responsiveness of supply to a change in price

Formula:

$$\frac{percentage\:change\:in\:quantity\:supplied}{percentage\:change\:in\:price} $$

</br>

### Perfectly Elastic Supply

A change in price leads to a larger proportionate change in QS.

![[Perfectly Elastic Supply Curve]]
</br>

### Relatively Elastic Supply

![[Relatively Elastic Supply Curve]]
</br>

### Perfectly Inelastic Supply

A change in price leads to a smaller proportionate change in QS.

![[Perfectly Inelastic Supply Curve]]

</br>

### Relatively Inelastic Supply

</br>

### Factors affecting PES

- Time period - The longer the time period, the more elastic supply will be
- Spare Capacity - The more spare capacity a firm has, the more elastic supply is
- Higher stock levels - The higher stock levels are, the more elastic supply is
- Factor mobility - The easier factors of production can be moved, the more elastic supply will be
</br>

## Income Elasticity of Demand

</br>

- YED = % change in quantity demanded over % change in income

- YED examines the effect on demand for goods and services when consumers incomes change

- It classifies goods as :
	- Inferior goods
	- Necessity goods
	- Luxury goods

- If YED > 1, then the good is a luxury good.

- If 0 < YED < 1, then the good is a necessity good. As incomes rise, demand rises by a relatively small percentage, e.g. rice, bread, etc.

- If YED < 0, then the good is an inferior good. As incomes rise, demand for the good falls, e.g. supermarket 'value' products.

- The greater the value (or closeness for 0 for necessity goods), the stronger the relationship
</br>

## Cross Price Elasticity of Demand

- XED = % change in quantity demanded good A over % change in price of good B

- If XED is negative, as the price of one good rises, demand for the other falls. These are complimentary goods. 

- The bigger the value, the stronger the relationship.

- If it is < 1 then we call them weak. If it is > 1 we call them strong.

- If XED is positive, then as the price of one good rises, demand for the other rises. We classify them as substitutes.

- If XED is 0, then a change in the price of one good does nothing to demand for the other good. We classify them as unrelated.
