# Foreign Aid - Growth and Development

</br>

Definition: A voluntary transfer of resources from one country to another

Foreign aid is counted in Secondary Income in the Current Account on the Balance of Payments

</br>

### Why do we give aid?

- Humanitarian reasons - emergency relief
- Economic motives - aid might be given to build economic ties with the recipient countries
- Political motives - countries such as France provide aid to its ex-colonies. The USA has provided aid to support capitalism

</br>

### Advantages of Aid

- Helps to overcome the savings gap and foreign currency gap
- Overseas aid can play a role in stabilizing post-conflict environments and also in disaster recovery
- Project aid can fast-forward investment in critical infrastructure, eventually leading to higher productivity
- Long-term aid for health and education projects - builds human capital and stronger social institutions
- Targeted aid that lifts the growth rate of the poorest countries benefits donor countries to as opportunities for external trade grow

</br>

### Types of aid and their impact

- [[Economics/Glossary#Bilateral aid|Bi-Lateral aid]]: Aid from one country to another
- Channelled through international bodies (e.g. UN, World Bank)
- Project aid: Direct financing of projects for a donor country
- Technical assistance: Funding of expertise of various types
- Humanitarian aid: Emergency disaster relief, food aid, refugee relief and disaster preparedness
- Soft loans: A loan made to a country on a concessionary basis
- Tied aid: i.e. projects tied to suppliers in a donor country
- Debt relief: This can include cancellation, rescheduling, refinancing, etc. of a country’s external debts
</br>

#### Burundi and Aid

**Which types of aid will support development?**

- Debt relief - the country is struggling to pay back their debts due to more pressing domestic matters, and so relieving their debt will allow the country to channel the forgiven debt into infrastructure and improving the standards of living
- Technical assistance/project aid - providing expertise and improving education will increase productive capacity. Improving the productive capacity of the country will allow a move away from subsistence farming and help to industrialise the region.
- Tied aid - giving aid based on anti-corruption/governmental commitments will allow Burundi to liberalise their government, which will in turn create a government in the best interest of the people

</br>

Well-directed and targeted aid can enhance a country’s growth potential but the effects may not be seen for many years, e.g. Aid might hep finance the building of a power station - This contributes directly to aggregate demand and increases supply potential.
</br>

### Problems of using Aid

- A government may not have the welfare of the population at heart - the aid does not go to where it is needed
- Sometimes given for political reasons
- If aid is ‘tied’ the poorer country may end up paying more for goods and services than they otherwise might have
- Long-term provision of foodstuffs may force down the price for domestic farmers, e.g. Haiti’s rice farming industry
- Culture of dependency
