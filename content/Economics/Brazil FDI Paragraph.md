# Brazil FDI Paragraph

</br>

Foreign Direct Investment into Brazil is likely to have a multiplier effect on the economy. The Multiplier Effect is the ratio of change in national income to increase in GDP. The decrease in unemployment, higher wages, and better employee welfare that FDI will bring to an economy will increase aggregate demand (as consumers are able to purchase and consume more). This in turn will increase the rate of economic growth, and because of the multiplier effect, national income will increase. Not only does higher national income create better standards of living for the population and a further increase in AD as a result of higher consumption, it also generates higher tax revenues for the Brazilian government, which they can reinvest into public projects such as infrastructure or healthcare (a system which is in dire need of reform).
