# Half Term 1 Summary Macroeconomics

</br>





## What is Macroeconomics?

- Considers the economy <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">as a whole</mark>
- Looks at the success or failure of government policies
- Uses data to analyse <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">economic performance</mark>
- Studies <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">big issues</mark> that affect everyone such as inflation, trade, etc.
</br>

## Macroeconomic Objectives

![[Economics/Macroeconomic Objectives]]





</br>

### Economic Growth

- Occurs when GDP (the value of everything produced) rises
- Uses<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> Real GDP</mark>, to remove the effects of inflation
- Figures updated monthly and quarterly

### Low/Stable Inflation

- A <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">general rise in prices</mark>
- Negative inflation is called <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">deflation</mark>
- Key measure is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) - basket of goods





### Full Employment

- Everyone who is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">willing and able</mark> to work has a job
- Measured by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Claimant Count</mark> - Number of people claiming unemployment related benefits - or the labour force survey, a quarterly survey of households (50k per quarter approx.)





### Balance of Payments

- The balance of<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> imports vs exports</mark>
- Negative balance is called a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">deficit</mark>, and a positive balance is a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">surplus</mark>
</br>





## National Income Statistics

It is important to measure economic performance because it allows governments to see if they are meeting targets, economists to forecast expected growth, and acts as an important measure of living standards.





### Macroeconomic Indicators

-   Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The total value of national output produced in a given time period
-   Gross National Income (GNI): GDP plus net income from overseas
-   GDP per capita: Income per head of population
-   Nominal GDP: The GDP of a country at current prices
-   Real GDP: The GDP of a country at constant prices (after the effects of inflation have been removed)
-   Green GDP: The value of national output minus the cost of environmental damage





### Index Numbers

Changes in indicators are usually measured using<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> index numbers</mark>. The base year is taken as 100. In future, an increase in the indicator causes the number to rise above 100, whereas a fall causes it to fall below.
</br>





## Circular Flow of Income

![[output-onlinepngtools.png]]
In the circular flow of income, money flows <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">between households and firms</mark>, through different mediums such as consumption, expenditure, wages, etc.





Government spending, Exports and investments are <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">'injections'</mark> to the economy. Taxes, Imports and Savings are <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">withdrawals/leakages</mark>. 

If J (Injections) = W (Withdrawals) then the economy is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">in equilibrium</mark>
If J > W then national income rises
If J < W then national income falls

</br>

## Aggregate Demand and Supply
</br>





### Aggregate Demand

Aggregate Demand is the<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">total demand for Goods and Services</mark> produced within the economy over a period of time





AD = Consumption (C) + Investment (I) + Gov. Spending (G)

### Aggregate Demand Curve

The AD curve shows the relationship between the general price level and Real GDP.





As prices rise: real incomes fall and therefore consumers are <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">less able to consume</mark>; As prices rise, the more expensive exports become and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">foreigners are less able to consume</mark>; As prices rise, interest rates generally rise and the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">less consumers are able to borrow</mark>
