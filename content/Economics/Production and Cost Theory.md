# Production and Cost Theory

How firms can increase production and the impact of this on the costs of production in the short and long run.
</br>

## Production Theory
</br>

#### Specialisation

Specialisation occurs when workers are assigned specific tasks within a production process. This enables trade and exchange to occur.

##### Division of Labour 

Specialisation by workers who perform different tasks at different stages of production

##### Advantages of specialisation

- Reduces errors in production
- More efficient
- Reduction in costs of production
- Encourages investment in specific capital - economies of scale

##### Disadvantages of specialisation

- Boring → lower productivity due to low motivation
- Risk of structural unemployment due to occupational immobility

</br>

#### Production

- Production is the relationship between inputs and outputs, e.g. to make a car, raw materials are combined with workers and capital (factors of production)
- The production process will have an impact on a firm’s costs of production

#### Productivity

- This is a measure of efficiency in an economy - output per unit of input employed
- Labour productivity - output per worker per period of time
- One of the most widely used measures of productivity is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per hour worked

#### Short Run Production Theory - Key Ideas

- In the short run at least one factor of production is fixed
- The only way a firm can increase its output in the short run is by adding more of a variable factor (labour) to a fixed factor (capital).
</br>

#### Total, Average, Marginal Product

Initially, output per person rises - increasing marginal returns - (Increased specialisation and efficiency). There will come a point when output per person will start to fall. This is known as *the [[Economics/Glossary#law of diminishing returns|law of diminishing returns]]*.

```ad-summary
title: Law of Diminishing Returns

If increasing quantities of a variable input are combined with a fixed input, everntually the marginal product and then the average product will decline
```

This is a short term law.
</br>

#### Long Run Production Theory

- All factors of production are variable
- There is no distinction between fixed and variable costs in the long run

To escape the adverse effect of rising short run costs upon profit, in the long run a firm may decide to change the scale of its operations. In the long run a firm is able to change the scale of production, e.g. buy more equipment, move to new premises, etc.

Long run is known as the planing stage - where forms plan ahead to change its fixed factors. Once the fixed factors have changed firm will return to short run.

##### Law of Returns to Scale

This describes how output changes when the scale of all factors of production change. They are the technical relationship in production between inputs and outputs measured in physical units.

Returns to scale is all about factor inputs vs gains to output. So, returns to scale is a measure of output volume.

```ad-note
title: Increases and Decreases

##### Increase in returns to scale

An increase in the scale of all inputs causes a more than proportionate increase in output

##### Constant returns to scale

An increase in the scale of all inputs causes a proportionate increase in output

##### Decrease in returns to scale

An increase in the scale of all inputs causes a less than proportional increase in output
```

##### Finding an optimal mix between Labour and Capital

In the long run, businesses will be looking for an output that combines labour and capital in a way that maximises productivity and reduces unit costs towards their lowest level.

This may lead to capital-labour substitution where capital machinery and new technology replaces some of the labour input.

<br>

## Cost Theory

These costs occur when the firm has a limited ability to increase levels of production. Cost curves measure the costs a firm have to pay to hire the inputs or factors of production. 

### Fixed Costs

#### Over Head Costs

The costs of employing the fixed factors of production in the short run, e.g. rent - does not change with output. Average fixed costs will fall as production increases

#### Variable Costs

The costs of employing the variable factors of production in the short run.

<br>
#### Long Run Average Cost Curve

The LRAC curve shows the firm’s lowest cost per unit at each lebel of output, assuming that all factors of production are variable. In the long run firms can move from one short run cost curve to another. The minimum possible average cost at each level of output is shown by the LRAC curve.

![[LRAC]]

All points on the LRAC curve show the least cost at any given output. Micro theory assumes that firms will always choose the least costly method of production in the long run. The lowest possible point on the LRAC curve is a point of productive efficiency, where constant returns are occurring.
<br>

#### Economies of Scale and the LRAC Curve

Long run costs tend to fall as an output increases. Economics of scale are then said to exist. For economies of scale to occur, the firm needs increased returns to scale to be happening. 

If the firm can get more outputs for its inputs, then it means the productivity of its inputs has increased, which brings down average costs.

The shape of the LRAC curve is determined by internal economies of scale.

## Economies and Diseconomies of Scale
<br>

### Economies of Scale

Economies of scale are the cost advantages that a business can exploit by expanding their scale of production. The effect of economies of scale is to reduce the average (unit) costs of production.

There are many different types of economy of scale and depending on the particular characteristics of an industry, some are more important than others.

#### Internal economies of scale

Internal economies of scale arise from the growth of the business itself. 

##### Technical economies of scale

Large-scale businesses can afford to invest in expensive and specialist capital machinery. For example, a supermarket chain such as Tesco or Sainsbury's can invest in technology that improves stock control. It might not, however, be viable or cost-efficient for a small corner shop to buy this technology.

##### Marketing economies of scale

A large firm can spread its advertising and marketing(fixed cost) budget over a large output and it can purchase its inputs in bulk at negotiated discounted prices if it has sufficient negotiation power in the market. Large firms also benefit from brand awareness-less advertising needed.

##### Managerial economies of scale

This is a form of division of labour. Large-scale manufacturers employ specialists to supervise production systems, manage marketing systems and oversee human resources.

##### Financial economies of scale

Larger firms are usually rated by the financial markets to be more 'credit worthy' and have access to credit facilities, with favourable rates of borrowing. In contrast, smaller firms often face higher rates of interest on overdrafts and loans. Businesses quoted on the stock market can normally raise fresh money (i.e. extra financial capital) more cheaply through the issue of shares. They are also likely to pay a lower rate of interest on new company bonds issued through the capital markets.

</br>

#### External economies of scale

External economies of scale occur within an industry. Examples of external economies of scale include:

- ﻿﻿Development of research and development facilities in local universities that several businesses in an area can benefit from
- ﻿﻿Spending by a local authority on improving the transport network for a local town or city
- Relocation of component suppliers and other support businesses close to the main centre of manufacturing are also an external cost saving
<br>

### Diseconomies of Scale

Diseconomies of scale occur when a business grows so large that the costs per unit increase. As output rises, it is not inevitable that unit costs will fall. Sometimes a business can get too big!

Diseconomies of scale occur for several reasons, but all as a result of the difficulties of managing a larger workforce.

#### Poor communication

As the business expands communicating between different departments and along the chain of command becomes more difficult. There are more layers in the hierarchy that can distort a message and wider spans of control for managers. This may result in workers having less clear instructions from management about what they are supposed to do when.

In addition, there may be more written forms of communication (e.g. newsletters, notice boards, e-mails) and less face-to-face meetings, which can result in less feedback and therefore less effective communication.

#### Lack of motivation

Workers can often feel more isolated and less appreciated in a larger business and so their loyalty and motivation may diminish. It is harder for managers to stay in day-to-day contact with workers and build up a good team environment and sense of belonging. This can lead to lower employee motivation with damaging consequences for output and quality. The main result of poor employee motivation is falling productivity levels and an increase in average labour costs per unit.

#### Loss of direction and co-ordination

It is harder to ensure that all workers are working for the same overall goal as the business grows. It is more difficult for managers to supervise their subordinates and check that everyone is working together effectively, as the spans of control have widened. A manager may be forced to delegate more tasks, which while often motivating for his subordinates, leaves the manager less in control.
