# Evaluating Fiscal Policy

</br>

### Whatâ€™s the rationale behind lower taxes?

- Lower direct taxes allows consumers to keep more of their income which they can use for consumption - this increases AD
- Lower corporation tax allows firms to keep more of their profits which they can use for investment - this increases AD and LRAS
- Lower direct taxes incentivises foreign firms to set up businesses in the UK - this could increase foreign direct investment into the UK
- Lower direct taxes reduces the risk of tax avoidance because it is seen as less of a penalty for success

### The effects of lower taxes

The effect of lower taxes depends on:

##### The magnitude of the tax cut

A small cut in taxation, e.g. a cut in tax to 18%, is likely to only have a small impact on firms willingness to invest. A larger tax cut, closer to the Irish rate of 12.5%, is likely to have a greater effect (but consider the effect on government tax revenue). This can be shown by the Laffer Curve.

##### The marginal propensity to consume

The larger the MPC the greater the size of the multiplier. This means a tax cut could lead to an even greater increase in final income. Poorer households have a higher MPC than richer households, so tax cuts aimed at lower income groups *should* increase consumption proportionally more. A tax cut for top rates payers would have less of an impact on consumption (but may have an impact on tax avoidance).

##### The stage of the economic cycle

The impact of a tax cut will be more noticeable during a recession. This is because there is plenty of spare capacity so an increase in consumption should lead to a bigger rise in real GDP. During a boom phase, when the economy is at full employment, any cut in taxes is only likely to lead to a rise in inflationary pressure and not increase real GDP.
