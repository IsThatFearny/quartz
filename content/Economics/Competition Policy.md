# Competition Policy

Competition policy concerns actions by the government to make markets more competitive. It comprises policy towards monopolies, mergers, and restrictive trading practices. 

Governments will seek to intervene in markets to protect consumers, unless: a) economies of scale allow firms to produce at a lower average cost, or b) low entry and exit barriers allows for a degree of contestability.

### Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)

The Competition and Markets Authority is the government agency responsible for advising on and implementing UK competition policy. The CMA uses market structure, conduct, and performance indicators to check for monopoly abuse, e.g. concentration ratios and consumer complaints. Relatively few firms are investigated - in the UK the threat of regulation is seen as satisfactory.

### Monopoly Policy

- ‘Monopoly busting’ - breaking up of a monopoly (very rare - last example was the break up of the British Airports Authority in 2011)
- Use of price controls - not as popular these days (e.g. energy price capping)
- Taxing monopoly profits (e.g. windfall taxes)
- Making markets more contestable (e.g. offering subsidies to startups or deregulating)

</br>

### Merger Policy

- The term ‘merger policy’ covers all types of acquisition; friendly or hostile, willing or unwilling
- A takeover or merger is investigated if it is expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition and/or consumer exploitation

</br>

### Restrictive trading practices

- Independent restrictive practices are undertaken by a single firm, e.g. engaging in price discrimination, abusive advertising practices, or refusal to supply a particular resale outlet
- Collective restrictive practices are undertaken by a group of firms (cartel), e.g. price fixing amongst firms in a market, market sharing, or bid rigging
- If a firm is found to have acted in a way that restricts competition, it can be fined or the director of the firm disqualified

### Nationalisation

#### Arguments for nationalisation

- If a firm is heavily in debt, then nationalisation can bail them out
- Essential utilities (e.g. water) can be provided with a satisfactory level of service, rather than consumer exploitation
- Without nationalisation, regulators may need to raise price caps on natural monopolies, putting pressure on households
- A more allocatively efficient level of production can be provided and long term investment could be financed

#### Arguments against nationalisation

- Upfront cost of bringing a firm under state control is very large
- Ongoing costs might increase burden on taxpayers
- Lack of a profit motive would cause the firm to not be productively efficiecnt
- There is no guarantee of adequate future investment - possible risk of government failure if poorly managed
