### Is it possible to separate fact and fiction in narrative sources like the sagas?

It is an almost impossible task to separate fact and fiction in sources such as these: there are many different narratives surviving in different forms, and thus the exact details become hazy and vague. However, it can be possible when, as Barraclough explains, multiple sources align, such as the *Saga of the Greenlanders* and the *Saga of Erik the Red*. The information contained within these is often quite similar, and cross-referencing multiple sources can legitimise their reliability. However, even between sources with such similarities, important differences remain.

### Should the sagas be used as evidence for the voyages of the tenth and eleventh centuries, or as evidence for the thirteenth-century Icelanders who wrote them?

The sagas have a strong element of fantasy about them: take, for example, the unipeds and other mythical monsters described throughout. However, their relatively accurate descriptions of such places as the Labrador coast and various other islands which would align with their proposed routes of exploration imply that the voyages described may have indeed occurred. There is also a small archaeological record which corroborates these claims.

### What differences can you see in the manner in which Gudrid is presented in the _Saga of the Greenlanders_, which is discussed in Barraclough's chapter, and in the _Saga of the Eirik the Red_, which you have read for yourself? How significant are those differences?
