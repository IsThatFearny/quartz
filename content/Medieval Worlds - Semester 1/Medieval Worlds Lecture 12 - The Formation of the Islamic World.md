# Medieval Worlds Lecture 12 - The Formation of the Islamic World


- Islam as a religion was born during the medieval period (as opposed to Judaism and Christianity)
- Major traditional islamic sources include:
	- **The Quran:** the holy book, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad over 23 years
	- **Hadith:** Words, deeds, and silences of the Prophet
	- **Biographies:** *Sira* (Prophets' biography) and *maghazi* (war literature)
- Most of these sources were written down two or three centuries after the lifetime of Muhammad
- The Quran is *not* a history - it is a moral and doctrinal scripture - and thus sheds little light on the origins of Islam
- We have material evidence for the existence of Islam as early as the 7th century, e.g. Dome of the Rock, however this contradicts the standardised Quran and there are major inconsistencies
- One of the earliest surviving records of the Quran has been carbon dated between the late-6th and mid-7th century

### Muhammad

- Was born and grew up in Mecca as a member of the Quraysh tribe
- The Quraysh had many trade connections and were custodians of the Kaaba
- In c.610 he has the *visions/revelations* which form the basis of the Quran
- In c.622 he had to migrate to Medina to escape persecution
- c620s: he unites the Arabian tribes and defeats the Meccans in 630 CE

#### The Major Teachings

- Monotheism and rejection of idolatry
- Historical continuity with Judaism and Christianty
- Draws on figures such as Abraham, Moses, Jesus, etc. important to Jews and Christians. Considers them to be prophets who preached islamic messages, but whose followers deviated
- Preaches righteous living, emphasising moral conduct, behaviour, commanding right and forbidding wrong
- Daily prayers, annual fasting (Ramadan), charity and pilgrimage were important parts of his preaching
