### Hereford Mappa Mundi

The modern conception of a map is its purpose as a navigational aid; however, the Hereford *mappa mundi* was not created with such a purpose in mind. Rather, the map has a meaning that is more symbolic than practical. It can be argued that, rather than being intended as an accurate, proportional map of the world, is it instead intended to be a historical and eschatological record, with specific emphasis on the eschatological aspect.[^1] 

Christianity is central to the map and its imagery. For example, the depiction of Christ at the head (East) of the map implies his atemporal and omni-existence; there are various depictions of biblical scenes and locations (such as the Garden of Eden and the Holy Land), and various creatures that seem to be derived from a bestiary and are perhaps a manifestation of the effects of sin.[^2] Further to this, the decision of the map's creator to use a 'TO' layout implies that the map was centred around Christianity: the 'TO' layout serves to represent the division of the earth into three peoples, each descended from one of Noah's three sons, Shem (Asia), Ham (Africa), and Japheth (Europe).[^3] Such biblical imagery and clear Christian motifs support the notion that the Hereford map was originally created to be used in an ecclesiastical context such as an altarpiece or as guidance for pilgrims and those wishing to go through penitential rites.[^4] 

From a historical standpoint, one can observe many important events occurring throughout the map: for example, the city of Troy is depicted, as are the conquests of Alexander the Great and certain roman roads and routes. However, it would seem that such events only warrant inclusion for their merits as religious symbols: Alexander is one of three aside from Adam who have 'lordship of the world';  Troy is a town that is highly relevant to the quests of Aeneas; and of course the romans christianised much of the world during their height.[^5]

It is important to note that, whilst the map's creator was likely trying to achieve a purpose other than geographical, such as those mentioned above, this does not necessarily mean that the map was not to be used in this way at all. Medieval scholars believed that an understanding of the physical world around them and their place in it would bring them closer to an understanding of God - after all, He is purported to have created all things, and thus an understanding of such things would serve to improve one's understanding of God's role.[^6] The map's rough geography would aid in such an understanding, and therefore its use as a geographical aid is evident.

It becomes quite clear that the creator the Hereford *mappamundi* intended the map as an ecclesiastical guide, and secondarily as a historical record of the landmark events in the Christian faith. Whether the map was to be used by pilgrims planning their route to the Holy Land; as a reaffirmation of God as 'all-encompassing'; as a method of connecting major historical world events to Christianity; or as guidance for those wishing to go through various penitential rites, there is overwhelming evidence that its purpose was as an ecclesiastical aid, and this is what its creator was attempting to achieve.[^7]

### Anna Komnene's *Alexiad*

Upon first glance at the preface to the *Alexiad*, the aims of Anna Komnene may seem immediately clear: she professes that she is trying to prevent her father's deeds from being forgotten and to keep a written record of his reign. However, recent scholarship suggests that, in direct contention with Komnene's claim, Alexios Komnenos' memory was not likely to be forgotten: it was a key tool used in consolidating the legitimacy of his successors.[^8] Thus it is commonly argued that the *Alexiad* was not merely a history, but a political tool intended to be used in Anna Komnene's attempt at usurpation and various other Machiavellian political manoeuvres. 

The first evidence of this comes in the preface to the *Alexiad*. Komnene asserts herself as 'born in the purple', a title which gave legitimacy to one's lineage, and as 'having read thoroughly the treatises of Aristotle and the dialogues of Plato, and having fortified my mind with the Quadrivium of sciences'.[^10] Whilst she insists that she divulges such information 'out of compulsion', there is a clear hidden purpose: Komnene means to assert herself as deserving of the throne that she was denied. She saw herself as significantly better educated than her brother who had won the throne, and saw such intelligence as the requirement for ruling.[^11] Here, she makes her superior intellect very clear, and in doing so promotes the message that she is the rightful heir to the throne. This propaganda was intended as an attempt to legitimise her claim, so that in the event of a coup (which she did indeed attempt), she could argue that she was deserving of the throne.

Another manifestation of what Anna Komnene was trying to achieve in writing the *Alexiad* is the way in which she subtly criticises the reign of her nephew, Manuel, who she and her supporters to have a false claim to the throne - she believed that she was the best suited to rule and the natural heir to her father. Manuel was known for favouring foreign 'barbarians', a love for astrology, and his infidelity with various mistresses: these qualities, when directly contrasted with Komnene's account of her father's devotion to Christianity, serve to portray Manuel as blasphemous and thus unworthy of the throne.[^9]

It is also argued that Anna Komnene did not conceive of lone rule - rather, she envisaged a successful usurpation as establishing her husband, Nikephoros Byrennios, as the 'de jure' emperor (i.e. leading battles and acting as the face of the monarchy) and her as 'de facto' empress, making decisions and using her scholarship for the benefit of the empire.[^12] She may have thought of herself as embodying Plato's conception of a 'philosopher king'.[^13] Thus, in writing the history of her father, Komnene also seeks to legitimise her husband as deserving of the throne and the associated power, describing him as 'very intelligent, and truly superior to his contemporaries', and affording him the title of 'Caesar', a title which Alexios had originally bestowed upon him. Such reaffirmation of her husband's right to rule comes across as an attempt to legitimise both her husband, and by extension, herself.

The *Alexiad* was written as a propaganda document, in an attempt to glorify and endorse Anna Komnene (and her husband), despite Komnene's own protestations about this being the purpose. In extolling Alexios Komnenos and herself, she portrayed her opponents as underserving of the throne, in the hopes that it would present her in a more appealing light when it inevitably came to her attempted usurpation. Whilst this purpose was clearly not realised to the extent that she might haev wi
