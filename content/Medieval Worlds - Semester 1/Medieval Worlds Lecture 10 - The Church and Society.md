# Medieval Worlds Lecture 10 - The Church and Society


- 'Stereotypical' medieval church is rooted in truth, largely because of the protestant reformation
- There is a tendency to think about the church as a rigid and immutable institution; however, there was a significant amount of change in the church throughout the period
- Also a tendency to view the church as separate from 'the many', and to view 'the many' as gullible - lack of understanding of theological complexity does not necessarily mean stupid
- The Church's power-base was rooted in the assent of society

</br>

- **Two major narratives:** 'Top-down' Gregorian reform, with an emphasis on the papacy and ecclesiastical elite; and 'Bottom up' reform, driven by laypeople rather than the elites

### 'Top-down' narrative

- In the mid-11th century, the papacy became a proactive as well as a *re*active institution
- It aimed to create a strong clerical hierarchy, centred on the pope, and entirely free from secular influence
- Aims to eliminate clerical marriage and simony (buying church office)

**Conflict between Gregory VII and Emperor Henry IV**

- 1075: Pope Gregory pontificates that only the pope is able to invest new bishops
- Henry IV ignores this and invests a new archbishop into the archbishopric of Milan
- 1076: A group of Bishops write to Gregory VII, complaining that in his ruling he has stripped them of all their power. Gregory VII excommunicates Henry IV from the church
- 1077: Henry IV begs Gregory for forgiveness, under pressure from princes. The sentence of excommunication is lifted
- 1080: Henry IV installs an 'anti-pope', Clement III
- 1085: Pope Gregory dies
- 1122: Callixtus II and Henry V agree that secular rulers can suggest appointments and bishops should swear an oath to the monarchy, but only popes can invest bishops. **Concordat of Worms**.

</br>

- This resolution centralised the papacy and gave a stronger sense of ecclesiastical hierarchy
- It reimagined the relationship between Church and State, and imposed clerical celibacy

</br>

### Bottom-up narrative

- This narrative argues that change is not purely derived from centralised ecclesiastical institutions, but reform primarily happens on a local level
- The papacy as the 'centre' of the church is consolidated by reform - it is not seen in this way before reform
- Women are important in this narrative as historical actors and as objects to 'think with'
</br>

**The Pataria of Milan**

- The Pataria were a movement consisting largely of merchants and tradespeople (laypeople) and lower-ranking clergy, in opposition to Archbishops
- The movement boycotted the services of married priests and would physically attack them
- Ariald of Carimate (1010-1066): deacon and preacher, preaching against clerical marriage and luxurious lives of the clergy; Peter Damian: picks up on the Pataria movement, and it becomes an open secret at the Papal curia that there are problems in northern Italy. Peter urges the importance of acting decisively on the matter
- Peter's urging likely leads to Pope Nicholas II 1059 decree on clerical marriage

</br>

**Why do laypeople care?**

- Laypeople are largely motivated by worries about salvation - priests take care of one's soul, and if they are not of sound religious devotion then the common man's salvation may be compromised
- Concerns about hypocrisy in the church
- The church is a central part of many people's lives - to see it break down would be a cause of great distress

</br>

**Women as laypeople**

- The beliefs of ecclesiastical elites about women both shape and are used to communicate reform
- Violation of clerical celibacy blamed on priests as much as on women, but there is major discourse on the role of women as 'pollutants'
