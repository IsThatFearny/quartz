# Medieval Worlds Lecture 2 - Which Medieval Worlds, Where?


- Does 'Medieval' hold a purely historical significance? Perhaps not a periodisation that should be argued for, just a convenient term
- Middle ages usually characterised as (roughly) the millennium between c.500 CE and c.1500 CE
- Medieval = *medium* (Latin for 'middle') + *aevum* (Latin for 'age')
- Lines are often blurred between periods - no absolute breaks in reality, historians create breaks to in order to divide history
- Definition is negative - neither ancient nor renaissance/modernity
- Conception of the 'middle ages' began with the renaissance, who defined the period that they were coming out of as medieval
- See Petrarchan conception of 'the dark ages' and 'the middle ages'

> [!NOTE] Petrarch (mid 14th c.)
> "But if, as I wish and ardently hope, you shall live on after me, a better age will come again: this ignorant stupor surely can't last forever. Perhaps when the dark clouds are lifted, our descendants might enjoy once more the radiance which the ancients knew."


#### Eurocentrism

- Medievalism is a eurocentric periodisation
- Bound up with ideas of loss of knowledge and 'civilised society', an age of ignorance, faith, violence, etc.
- Often seen as the origins of modern European nationhood and nation states, and the roots of the rise of the west to dominance
- 'The west' inherits Roman culture and intellectual knowledge, rather than that of the middle east

- The periodisation of the middle ages often changes depending on region depending on certain events, often compared to Rome's influence. Period ends when Europe becomes a dominant force, e.g. India in 1707 CE (East India Company), Africa in 1800 CE (colonisation), and Persia in 1797 CE (Influence of Napoleonic Wars)
- Story of Medieval Europe is parallel the trend of the a wider Eurasia

#### Other Medieval Stories

- Formation of Christendom
	- Defined by the way that Roman insitutions framed life, society, economics, politics, etc.
	- Those within Christendom saw themselves as still in the Roman world (e.g. Holy Roman Emperor)
- Formation of Islamacate world
	- Islamic institutions fundamental to the medieval world, i.e. translation movement in Baghdad, Toledo, etc.
- Transregional Nomadic Empire
	- Central Eurasian Steppe often said to be 'without history'
	- Mongol Empire was latest in a long series of nomadic states, connecting the far west to the far east
	- Some argue that the medieval world in this perspective began with the Seljuk Turks
	- Nomadic society one of the most important methods of integration
- Rise of Commerce
	- Networks of commercial activity stretch down to Zimbabwe and Eastern China
	- Perceived density of commerce in Europe down to concentrated research into this area
- Formation of the 'Old World'
	- Certain spheres encompassed and connected areas of the 'old world' - start of 'globalisation'

- Some argue for the concept of a 'global' middle ages rather than eurocentrism

- **Key thing that unites the medieval world is highly fragmentary evidence**
