- Anachronisms about the vikings is a medieval phenomenon to begin with, beginning with Icelandic sagas written in the 13th-century
- Many references to viking raids in early contemporary records, although often quite brief and written by those affected by raiding
- The word 'viking' comes from Old Norse; *vikingr* = 'pirate' or 'raider'
- In sources vikings are usually identified by their ethnic roots (i.e. Danish) or their religion (i.e. paganism)
- Monasteries were highly vulnerable - poor defences, unskilled inhabitants, and filled with treasured items
