- Anachronisms about the vikings is a medieval phenomenon to begin with, beginning with Icelandic sagas written in the 13th-century
- Many references to viking raids in early contemporary records, although often quite brief and written by those affected by raiding
- The word 'viking' comes from Old Norse; *vikingr* = 'pirate' or 'raider'
- In sources vikings are usually identified by their ethnic roots (i.e. Danish) or their religion (i.e. paganism)
- Monasteries were highly vulnerable - poor defences, unskilled inhabitants, and filled with treasured items

#### Causes of Viking activity

**Overpopulation in Scandinavia:** Seeking out new places to live was not a feature of early raiding

**Technological innovation:** Better, more seaworthy ships? Perhaps capable of tougher and longer/more intricate expeditions. However, technological innovations pre-date the start of raiding by a few centuries

**The marriage imperative:** Plundered items often found in women's graves. It is questioned whether raiding was a technique to improve chances of a favourable marriage by increasing wealth

- Vikings built large-scale trade networks throughout most of Europe, as well as Greenland, Iceland and North America

- Unlikely that Viking settlements were set up without some violence from the native population (e.g. Newfoundland colony was relatively short lived because of the constant threat from Native Americans; place names in Shetland and Orkney are almost entirely derived from Old Norse)
- Some contact between populations did exist in certain places. Archaeological evidence shows that certain local techniques were shared with the settlers (e.g. pottery and ceramic making)
- Iceland had no native population and was settled anew - a form of collective governance was established
