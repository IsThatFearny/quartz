- Empire built on a highly complicated taxation system
- Highly stratified society - many layers, class system
- Wealthy aristocracy generally not militarised - owning land and making profits from said land is the main source of wealth
- Large rich/poor divide
- Slavery a significant component of the empire and fundamental to society/culture
- 'Barbarians' is the term for society that did not consider themselves part of the empire

### The fall/transformation of Rome

- The Roman Empire technically doesn't 'fall' - rather, it splits into various barbarian kingdoms (e.g. goths, Franks, Vandals, etc.)
- Barbarian kingdoms originally happy with being re-settled in various parts of the empire, but eventually grew to desire ownership of land
- New identities arise as the empire breaks up
- Political economy shifts from taxation to the use of land as a commodity
