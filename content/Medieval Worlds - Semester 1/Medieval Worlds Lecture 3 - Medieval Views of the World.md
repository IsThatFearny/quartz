# Medieval Worlds Lecture 3 - Medieval Views of the World


### Hereford World Map

- Split into three continents - Europe (Bottom left), Africa (Bottom right), Asia (Top half)
- East-orientated
- Map depicts northern hemisphere only
- Southern hemisphere generally termed 'the antipodes' - believed that the equator was uninhabitable and uncrossable due to excessive heat, and that nobody lived in the Southern hemisphere because they must have a different ancestor than those in the northern hemisphere (i.e. not Adam and Eve, according to the church)
- Cartographers had awareness of the religious lens through which the world was viewed
- Manuscripts often informed geography - e.g. Alexander the Great - although were often subject to interpretation
- Monsters were a 'fact of life', able to be explained religiously
