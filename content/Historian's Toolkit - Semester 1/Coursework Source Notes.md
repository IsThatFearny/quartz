- Varlik identifies that scholarship on the plague in general has been largely eurocentric
- Plague (the second epidemic) in the Ottoman empire persisted longer than in Western Europe
- Ottoman areas largely overlooked in plague scholarship
- Evidence for plague persistence and periodisation can be vague - Enzootic forms of the virus (as opposed to epidemic and epizootic forms) do not cause mass death among the vector population; contemporary accounts very rarely account for the origins of the plague
- Plague calculated to persist for a century in a population of 60,000 rats
- Highly fragmentary nature of pre-18th century *y. pestis* specimens make it difficult to identify the age of plague foci and how long the disease persisted in these areas
- Varlik argues that an Ottoman perspective is essential in studying plague histories, even in areas where the plague has been identified as originating externally such as Europe. He also argues for a broadening of the scope when researching transmission methods. Varlik also urges that typical epidemiological boundaries be broken down and regions not be classified as 'Christian' or 'Muslim' tpo promote a global, rather than regional, plague history
