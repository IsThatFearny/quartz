## Rethinking the 'Black Death'

![[Pasted image 20240920141737.png|300x250]]

- Primarily spread from Middle East
- Pushed eastwards towards central Asia before going westwards to western Europe.
- Key moment believed to be the siege of Caffa/Kaffa - Mongol forces vs Genoese merchants in an attempt to defend grain producing areas
	- Many mongols had contracted disease - dead bodies catapulted over walls


> [!quote] Ibn Khaldun, Muqaddimah (1377)
> 'Civilisation both in the East and the West was visited by a destructive pestilence which devastated nations and caused populations to vanish. It swallowed up many of the good things of civilisation and wiped them out... Cities and building were laid waste, roads and way signs were obliterated, settlements and mansions became empty, and dynasties and tribes grew weak. The entire inhabited world changed'

- 'Black Death' consisted of epidemic outbreaks in and around Europe (1346-53)
- Later outbreaks of *Yersinia Pestis* came over the next 400 years
- Last major epidemic: Great plague of Marseille (1720-1)

#### Debate over nature of the Black Death

- Retrospective diagnosis difficult
- *Yersinia Pestis?* An Ebola-like virus? Anthrax?
- Using secondary descriptions to make diagnoses
- Modern (German diagnostic) understanding of disease premised on the model that it is caused by the reaction of our body to pathogens; this is at odds with the 'medieval' concepts of disease (bad air, etc.)
- Some felt that retrospective diagnosis is pointless as a result of this asymmetry; further, retrojecting our modern framework onto historical societies
