## Rethinking the 'Black Death'

- Primarily spread from Middle East
- Pushed eastwards towards central Asia before going westwards to western Europe.
- Key moment believed to be the siege of Caffa/Kaffa - Mongol forces vs Genoese merchants in an attempt to defend grain producing areas
	- Many mongols had contracted disease - dead bodies catapulted over walls


> [!quote] Ibn Khaldun, Muqaddimah (1377)
> 'Civilisation both in the East and the West was visited by a destructive pestilence which devastated nations and caused populations to vanish. It swallowed up many of the good things of civilisation and wiped them out... Cities and building were laid waste, roads and way signs were obliterated, settlements and mansions became empty, and dynasties and tribes grew weak. The entire inhabited world changed'

- 'Black Death' consisted of epidemic outbreaks in and around Europe (1346-53)
- Later outbreaks of *Yersinia Pestis* came over the next 400 years
- Last major epidemic: Great plague of Marseille (1720-1)

</br>

### Debate over nature of the Black Death

- Retrospective diagnosis difficult
- *Yersinia Pestis?* An Ebola-like virus? Anthrax?
- Using secondary descriptions to make diagnoses
- Modern (German diagnostic) understanding of disease premised on the model that it is caused by the reaction of our body to pathogens; this is at odds with the 'medieval' concepts of disease (bad air, etc.)
- Some felt that retrospective diagnosis is pointless as a result of this asymmetry; further, retrojecting our modern framework onto historical societies causes us to ignore their own framework for viewing disease

</br>

### New Evidence

- Ability to detect pathogens in ancient DNA samples (e.g. teeth, specifically dental pulp, can contain traces of rapidly-acting diseases such as *yersinia pestis* in blood). Suggests that *yersinia pestis* is the cause

#### Understanding *yersinia pestis*

- *Yersinia Pestis* is an **enzootic** disease (equivalent term to **endemic** for animal populations)


> [!info] Enzootic
> (of a disease) regularly affecting animals in a particular district or at a particular season.

- Rodent and other animal populations (e.g. marmots) carry fleas (vector transmitters), which in turn carry the bacteria

**Mortality:**

- Bubonic: 30-90%
- Pneumonic: 100%
- Gastrointestinal: ?%

</br>

- **Modern DNA** - *yersinia pestis* still exists, and thus it is possible to use live samples of the bacteria in research

- Using diagrams such as the one above, it is possible to cross-reference geography and evolutionary history of the bacteria
- Diagram shows 4 different strains of the bacteria, divided geographically

### Implications of new disease histories

- **Globalisation** - can reveal greater dispersion and thus improve global research; new evidence of dispersion to China, the Middle East, etc.
	- Geographical and temporal disconnection between outbreaks prevent historians from linking instances unless modern evidence connects them
	- Reveals disease as a cause of certain events (e.g. abandonment of Shanga, a trading outpost in Kenya)
- **Disease and the course of history** - developments in Black Death research show new ways of explaining significant historical processes (e.g. fall of Rome)
- **Animal histories** - changes our perspective on the spread of plague; the theory involving rats does not explain the movement of plague across vast distances; part of our explanation must involve other animal environments and hosts (e.g. marmots)
- **Revising Eurocentric histories** - global spread of plague allows us to change perspectives on the globa
