	- **T**opic: When, where, what, etc.
	- **H**istoriography: What scholarly conversation is the author engaging with? What does the work add to this dialogue?
	- **O**rganisation: What is the central organising structure? (chronological, thematic, geographic). How does said organisation advance the argument
	- **M**ethod: What sources are used? How is the evidence used and analysed
	- **A**rgument: What is the author's thesis
	- **S**o What?: What is the significance? What is important?
