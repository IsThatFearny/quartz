### Terminology

- From a British military perspective, the 1857 revolt was a mutiny - soldiers turned their guns on officers
- From a nationalist perspective, the revolt was indeed a revolt  - the term legitimised the event (the term mutiny implies illegitimacy)
- Marx terms the revolt 'The First War of Indian Independence'

</br>

### The Facts

- 100,000 Bengal army troops (17 regiments) put down their weapons and walked away from their officers
- Lasted a full year
- Led to the dissolution of the East India Company
- EIC lost Calcutta, Madras and Bombay
- India became a 'crown colony' directly ruled from London (Secretary of State for India position created)
- Represented a major threat to British domination over the empire

### Geography

- Dependent states (Princely states) were not under direct rule and were sovereign, but had deals with the EIC to provide protection in return for trade
- Most violence occurred in northern India
- Major centres of revolt included: Meerut, Delhi, Oudh, Kanpur, Jhansi, and Gwalior

</br>

### The Bengal Army

- Largely recruited from the north
- Having a position in the army afforded one a very high status
- The army had fought well and faithfully for the British, but always on their own terms - they refused to go overseas and required a very large amount of support staff
- More flexible soldiers were becoming available in Nepal and the Punjab, and the Bengal army was forced to modernise with new rifles and the requirement to travel abroad

</br>

### Pre-1857

- Company rule commercial enterprise underline by a ruthless machine
- Sepoys paid little and suffered discrimination and racism
- Highest post for an Indian in The Company was the *subedar* - still below British COs
- Petty arrogance shown towards Indian soldiers
- Cartridge in the Enfield rifle rumoured to be greased with pig/cow fat - anathema to the religious communities of India
- 9th May 1857 - 85 Indian troops court martialled for refusing to obey orders relating to the new rifle and cartridge grease
- 10th May 1857 - 3rd Light Cavalry stormed the barracks and freed their comrades
- 50 Europeans killed by Indian civilians who joined the mutinies - simmering anger towards the British erupted into widespread violence

</br>
### Annexation of Oudh
- Lord Dalhousie used the lack of a male heir in Oudh to annexe the princely state - king and courtiers dispossessed and imperial title discontinued
- Caused great consternation in other areas with regal rulers, who were wary about the same happening to their thrones
- Excessive taxation was introduced in some areas of Oudh - peasants with small holdings were disgruntled by this, as were larger landowners who were stripped of their holdings

</br>

### Resentment

- Decades of interference into Indian affairs - forced religious conversion; laws banning child marriage; Hindu deities ridicules (polytheism) and abuses of Ram and Muhammad by British officers - contributed to resentment
- Law manipulated to give Europeans little punishment (European only juries and judges) and Indians severe punishments
