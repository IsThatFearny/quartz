# Historians Toolkit Tutorial 4 Prep


### Why has the significance of the 1857 Rebellion been, in Joshi's words, "difficult to pin down"?

Hard to pin down because:

- Archives static and eurocentric
- Most sources written in the immediate aftermath, without the benefit of hindsight and with vitriol towards the enemy
- Many actions not documented, and so meaning has to be gained from context

### Why does Mukherjee think the sepoy mutinies were connected to a broader popular rebellion?

Mukherjee points out that there is clear evidence of communication along non-military lines and in public life - people were talking about and planning the uprising outside of the military context with which it is often identified. Mukherjee identifies a collectivity behind the uprising; he argues that what began as a military mutiny evolved into a peasant revolt due to a common enemy, this being the British. The sepoy mutiny catalysed the eventual peasant revolt, as the peasants were simply waiting for their signal.

### What does Dasgupta mean when he describes the sepoy mutinies as an "assertion of autonomous power" and how compatible is his characterisation of the Rebellion with Mukherjee's?



### In responding to the hypothetical essay question (Were the rebelling sepoys part of a wider people's movement?) which possible responses or positions can you identify so far on the basis of this week's reading - and which do you find most compelling right now?
