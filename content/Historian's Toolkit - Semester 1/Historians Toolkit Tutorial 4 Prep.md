# Historians Toolkit Tutorial 4 Prep


### Why has the significance of the 1857 Rebellion been, in Joshi's words, "difficult to pin down"?

Hard to pin down because:

- Archives static and eurocentric
- Most sources written in the immediate aftermath, without the benefit of hindsight and with vitriol towards the enemy
- Many actions not documented, and so meaning has to be gained from context

### Why does Mukherjee think the sepoy mutinies were connected to a broader popular rebellion?

Mukherjee points out that there is clear evidence of communication along non-military lines and in public life - people were talking about and planning the uprising outside of the military context with which it is often identified. Mukherjee identifies a collectivity behind the uprising; he argues that what began as a military mutiny evolved into a peasant revolt due to a common enemy, this being the British. The sepoy mutiny catalysed the eventual peasant revolt, as the peasants were simply waiting for their signal.

### What does Dasgupta mean when he describes the sepoy mutinies as an "assertion of autonomous power" and how compatible is his characterisation of the Rebellion with Mukherjee's?

Dasgupta's argument is that the sepoy mutiny was designed to show that the sepoys were able to wield power independently of the East India Company and of the Indian elites. The sepoys 'insisted on having the final say' and were, for a long time, able to refuse certain directions from the EIC such as travelling overseas. This characterisation is hardly compatible with Mukherjee's, who characterises the Sepoys as 'peasants in uniform'; Dasgupta portrays the Sepoys as seeking to become the new elite, and having significant power in society. He argues that they did not identify with the plight of the peasants in the way that Mukherjee suggests.

### In responding to the hypothetical essay question (Were the rebelling sepoys part of a wider people's movement?) which possible responses or positions can you identify so far on the basis of this week's reading - and which do you find most compelling right now?
