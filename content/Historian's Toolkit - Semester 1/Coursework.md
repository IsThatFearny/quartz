Varlik argues that an Ottoman experience of plague is not only valuable in our wider understanding of plague histories, but is in fact essential to scholarship on the subject. She makes the argument that considering an Ottoman perspective necessitates the abolition of epidemiological boundaries that have been formulated by previous scholars, and also posits that a more complex view of plague transmission is suggested by the Ottoman experience of plague.

Varlik focuses on plague persistence in order to support the latter argument. Ottoman cities, she argues, were repeatedly exposed to the plague during the Second Pandemic, with Istanbul experiencing an outbreak an average of every 2.2 years during this time, and she proposes that this is perhaps largely due to high levels of plague persistence in mammalian and rodent populations: in a population of 60,000 rats, *y. pestis* has been shown to be able to survive for 100 years.
