Varlik argues that an Ottoman experience of plague is not only valuable in our wider understanding of plague histories, but is in fact essential to scholarship on the subject. She makes the argument that considering a previously invisible Ottoman perspective necessitates the abolition of the "spatio-temporal epidemiological boundaries" that have been formulated by previous scholars, and also posits that a more complex view of plague transmission is suggested by the Ottoman experience of plague.

In evidencing the former argument, Varlik argues that, whilst eurocentric views of plague often periodise three distinct 'waves' of the disease, the Ottoman experience blurs the lines between these periods. She says that there is substantial evidence of plague in Ottoman cities between the Second and Third pandemics, such as the observations of Charles Maclean; thus the scholarship that argues for strict periodisation of plague infections is too limited in geographical scope, and must be revised to include the Ottoman experience.

Varlik focuses further on plague persistence in order to support the latter argument. Ottoman cities, she argues, were repeatedly exposed to the plague during the Second Pandemic, with Istanbul experiencing an outbreak an average of every 2.2 years during this time, and she proposes that this is largely due to high levels of plague persistence in mammalian and rodent populations: in a population of 60,000 rats, *y. pestis* has been shown to be able to survive for 100 years. Varlik says that this evidence suggests that the study of plague transmission would benefit from a regional and internal analysis of transmission: it was not always the case that the disease was imported. Indeed, there is evidence to show that the persistence of plague in Ottoman lands was a result of plague reservoirs in the highlands.

Varlik involves herself in the debate over globalisation of plague research. Her article challenges eurocentrism in contemporary plague scholarship, and the suggestion that the typical periodisation and spatial division which characterises much of the literature surrounding the plague is a flawed conception is of great value to the future of the field, as it seems to allow one to gain an improved and more accurate picture of plague on a global stage.

Rawcliffe argues that the records of late Medieval English 'leet courts' provide a previously highly underutilised resource when studying pre-modern European public health. She says that these records document the day-to-day bureaucracy of sanitisation in medieval cities, outside of pandemic events as well as during them. It is also pointed out that the lack of use of these records is likely the cause of the neglect of medieval public health histories.

Rawcliffe points out that, whilst leet court records could sometimes be vague or incomplete, they show that there was a system (however successful) of policing and enforcement of public health 'offences'. Rawcliffe gives the example of those who sold food to the public which posed a health risk: cooks could have their property confiscated, 'consigned to the pillory' or be forced to give up their trade for a year. Such punishments are evidence of a societal health consciousness, i.e. a collective understanding, at least at governmental level, of the dangers of certain practises. Whether or not this consciousness was reflective of widespread knowledge is another matter, but there is clear evidence of preventative action.

There is an acknowledgement that, whilst there is evidence of some level of epidemiological understanding at government level, public understanding of such preventative measures and their enforcement were not as developed as the intentions behind them. Rawcliffe provides evidence that health nuisances would often be perpetuated if fines were too low, and the penalty for causing such a nuisance could be easily negotiated. This is, perhaps, a reason for the view that epidemiological development began with the Black Death: there was little evidence of these measures working. Rawcliffe argues that the use of leet court records can rectify this gap in the literature.

The debate with which Rawcliffe's article participates revolves around the extent to which the Black Death catalysed epidemiological development. The evidence that she presents supports the view that measures to prevent the transmission of disease developed and were partially understood before the epidemics of the Black Death. This contests previous scholarship, which instead seeks to argue that the ravages of the Black Death were what caused authorities to consider how to prevent the disease. Rawcliffe's use of leet court records suggests otherwise, however.
