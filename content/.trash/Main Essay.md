# Main Essay

### ‘Lord Mansfield’s ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case of 1772 was the most important turning-point in this period, leading to the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1838. Assess the validity of this view’

</br>

Lord Mansfield’s ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case of 1772 was a key turning point in the struggle to abolish slavery in the British Empire. However, other events also served as important moments in this fight, and these must also be taken into consideration when assessing whether the ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case was the most important turning-point in the period, leading to the abolition of slavery in the British empire in 1838. Major events such as the formation of the anti-slave trade movement by the Quakers, the Slave Trade Act of 1807, the Haitian revolution (along with various other slave revolts), and [insert last LOE here] are also contenders for the ‘most important’ turning point in the lead up to the abolition of slavery. In this essay, I shall analyse these turning points and conclude whether Lord Mansfield’s ruling was indeed the most important turning point, or whether this title should go to a different turning point which is perhaps more deserving.

Lord Mansfield’s ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case of 1772 was indubitably an important moment in the process of abolishing slavery. The case set a legal precedent that a master could not remove a slave from the country without the consent of that slave, and that a slave could secure a writ of *habeus corpus* to prevent said removal.[^1]
