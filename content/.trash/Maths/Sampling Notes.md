# Sampling Notes

</br>

## Populations

The whole group of everything you want to investigate is the 'population'

Finite Population: A population which can be plausibly counted
Infinite Population: A population the size of which is impossible to know

</br>

## Censuses

A census is a survey of a whole population, carried out on an individual level.

##### Advantages

- An accurate representation of the population, as every member has been surveyed - unbiased

##### Disadvantages
- A great deal of time and effort required for large populations
- Expensive
- Difficult to survey all members - possible bias
- If items are damaged or used as a result of the census, it is impractical

</br>

## Sampling

If a census is impossible or impractical, you can examine a sample of the population instead.

To start, you must identify the members of the population that can be sampled, aka sampling units

Sampling frame: Full list of all sampling units, each assigned a unique number/name

###### Advantages
- Samples are easier to carry out, and are quicker and easier than a census
- Less expensive
- Only option when surveyed items are used or damaged

###### Disadvantages
- Variability introduced between samples
- Possibility of sampling bias

</br>

### Representative and Biased Samples

To draw accurate conclusions about a population, the sample must be representative.

If a sample is not representative, it is therefore biased, and cannot fairly represent the population. 
</br>
#### Avoiding Sampling Bias

1) Select from the correct population
2) Ensure that no member is excluded
3) Select your sample at random
4) Ensure all members respond

</br>

#### Simple Random Sampling
Simple random sampling ensures that every item or person has an equal chance of being in the sample, and that each selection is independent of others

To choose a simple random sample:

1) Give a number to each population member (taken from the full list)
2) Generate a list of random numbers and match these to the members. This is your sample

###### Advantages
- Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, making the sample unbiased
###### Disadvantages
- Can be inconvenient if population is spread over a large area

</br>

#### Systematic Sampling

You can also use a systematic sample for greater convenience and efficiency.

To choose a systematic sample:

1) Give a number to every member of the population (from the full list)
2) Calculate a regular interval to use by dividing the population size by the sample size
3) Generate a random starting point that is less than or equal to the size of the sample
4) Keep adding the interval to the starting point to select the sample

###### Advantages
- Can be used for quality control on a production line
- Should give an unbiased sample

###### Disadvantages
- The regular interval could coincide with a pattern, and therefore introduce bias
</br>

#### Stratified Sampling

If a population is divided into categories, then you can use a stratified sample - using the same proportion of each group as there is in the population

To choose a stratified sample:

1) Divide the population into categories
2) Calculate total population
3) Calculate the number needed for each category, using $$Size\:of\:Category = \frac{Size\:Of\:Category\:In\:Population}{Total\:Size\:of\:Population} \times Total\:Sample\:Size$$
4) Select the sample for each category at random

###### Advantages
- If the population has disjoint categories (no overlap) this is very likely to be representative
- Useful when results may vary depending on categories

###### Disadvantages
- Can be expensive because of extra detail involved

</br>

#### Quota Sampling

Involves dividing the population into categories, however no effort is made to select the sample at random

To choose a quota sample:

1) Divide the population into categories
2) Give each category a quota
3) Collect data until quotas are met in all categoies

###### Advantages
- It can be done when there isn't a full list of the population
- The interviewer continues to sample until quotas are met, so non-response is less of a problem

###### Disadvantages
- It can be easily biased by the interviewer

</br>

#### Opportunity Sampling

The sample is taken from a section of the population that is convenient for the sampler

###### Advantages
- Data can be gathered very easily and quickly
###### Disadvantages
- Not random, can be very biased
