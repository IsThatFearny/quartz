# Income Elasticity of Demand

</br>

- YED = % change in quantity demanded over % change in income

- YED examines the effect on demand for goods and services when consumers incomes change

- It classifies goods as :
	- Inferior goods
	- Necessity goods
	- Luxury goods

If YED > 1, then the good is a luxury good.

If 0 < YED < 1, then the good is a necessity good. As incomes rise, demand rises by a relatively small percentage, e.g. rice, bread, etc.

If YED < 0, then the good is an inferior good. As incomes rise, demand for the good falls, e.g. supermarket 'value' products.

The greater the value (or closeness for 0 for necessity goods), the stronger the relationship
