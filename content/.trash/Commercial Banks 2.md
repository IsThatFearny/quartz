# Text Elements
The Main Functions of Commercial Banks Continued ^E6Ax5C9R

Overdraft: When a current account has no deposits, consumers can still borrow money from the bank
in the form of an overdraft. These are at a high interest rate and the amount that can be
borrowed is limited.

Investment of funds: Surplus funds could be invested into securities such as government bonds and
treasury bills. These could earn a return for the bank

Agency functions: Banks represent their consumers. For example, they collect cheques and dividends, pay
bills, such as through a direct debit, they deposit interest and income tax, buy and sell securities, and
arrange the transfer of money between places for consumers. ^hrIMMhdq
