# Macroeconomic Objectives

## Low/Stable Inflation
- The UK aims for an inflation rate of 2%
- Monetary Policy is used to attempt to achieve this rate
- With low or stable inflation, money retains it's value (against international currencies)#
- Allows for better and more predictable fiscal planning for governments, businesses and individuals
- Increases investments

## Economic Growth
- The government wants economic growth to be high, as this will increase the standard of living
- Decreases unemployment
- Less Poverty
- Better education
- Better public services
- Higher life expectancy
- Higher individual and governmental income

## Low Unemployment
- The government wants to reduce unemployment, and aim towards full employment
- If more people are employed, aggregate demand increases, and the economy is more productive
- Reduces government borrowing
- Increases economic growth (More people with money)
- Minimises inequality and poverty
- Maintains a stable exchange rate

## Payment Equilibrium
- Governments want equilibrium in the balance of payments (Imports and exports costs are roughly equal)
- This is more desirable than a long-term deficit or surplus
- Equilibrium means less government borrowing, and more investing
