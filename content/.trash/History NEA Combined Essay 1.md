Lord Mansfield's ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case of 1772 was a key turning point in the struggle to abolish slavery in the British Empire. However, other events also served as important moments in this fight, and these must also be taken into consideration when assessing whether the ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case was the most important turning-point in the period leading to the abolition of slavery in the British empire in 1838. Major events such as the formation of the anti-slave trade movement by Quakers and Evangelical Christians, the Slave Trade Act of 1807, the Haitian revolution (along with various other slave revolts), and the Great Reform Act of 1832 also lay claim to the most important turning point in the lead up to the abolition of slavery. In this essay, I shall analyse these turning points, as well as supporting interpretations and primary sources, and shall conclude that the Great Reform Act of 1832 was the most important turning point in the struggle for the abolition of slavery in 1838.

Lord Mansfield's ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case of 1772 was without doubt an important moment in the process of abolishing slavery. The case set a legal precedent master could not remove a slave from the country without the consent of that slave, and that a slave could secure a writ of *habeus corpus* to prevent said removal.[^1] There had been multiple precursors to the Somerset case: Butts Vs Penny, Chamberlain Vs Harvey, Smith Vs Brown and Cooper, and R Vs Stapylton, to name but a few.[^2] The cases of Chamberlain Vs Harvey and Smith Vs Brown and Cooper were both presided over by Chief Justice Sir John Holt, and are considered to be direct predecessors to the Somerset Ruling: Holt's ruling in Smith Vs Brown and Cooper was that "as soon as a negro comes into England, he becomes free; one may be a villein in England, but not a slave".[^3] This did not abolish slavery in Britain, as Holt proceeded to establish a legal mechanism for selling slaves in Britain based upon unofficial advice to the claimant.[^4] As well as this, the judgement of the court in Chamberlain vs Harvey was that a slave could not be treated as chattel, but was instead a sort of "bound apprentice”.[^5] Therefore, whilst predecessors, these rulings did not have the same effect as *Somerset*. The reason why this was a turning point, rather than simply another ineffective ruling, was that whilst technically Mansfield only ruled on the two specific parts of the law mentioned previously, the ruling was seen by many contemporaries as effectively the abolition of slavery in Britain.[^6] Some went further, suggesting that the case could be the basis for the abolition of slavery in the British colonies too, based upon the idea that the laws of England travelled with Englishmen, and thus the law could be applied on any British settlements in the same way as in Britain.[^7] Mansfield's comments on the ruling certainly seem to imply that this was his viewpoint:

>“The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: It's so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.”

 Capel Lofft, 1772, as cited in T.B. Howell, A Complete Collection of State Trials Vol. XX, 1816. pg. 82

This extract is by all accounts a verbatim transcription of Lord Mansfield’s concluding remarks and ruling in the Somerset case.[^8] It was the case at this time that court records were not kept, and any preservation of rulings were documented by those present. This source is one such example: Capel Lofft, a lawyer and a barrister, was present at the trial, and documented Mansfield’s words. The source is contemporary to the Somerset case, and this adds value to it: the source is less likely to have been manipulated after its publication, and therefore it is more trustworthy and can be said to be generally accurate. The fact that this record is one of the sole surviving testaments to the Somerset ruling gives it intrinsic value to the historian, as without it we would not be able to corroborate the findings of the court, and thus our study of the abolition of slavery would be greatly hindered. The purpose of the source is twofold: Mansfield’s purpose is to provide his reasoning behind the verdict - this is of value to the historian because it demonstrates Mansfield’s attitude to slavery, and the reasoning behind the verdict, which is the very same reasoning that would be used in subsequent cases; Lofft’s purpose is to inform the general reader of the outcome of the Somerset case, and primarily to preserve it for posterity for use in case law. This adds significant value to the source because, in the interest of accurate preservation and information, Lofft is highly likely to have provided an accurate record of the ruling, and to have included comprehensive detail: indeed, he himself stated that "you will find the judgments exact in form, the reasons and principles entire, their force, dependence, and connexion preserved".[^9] He is, by his own admittance, perhaps prone to error, but he argues that “if he erred in reporting, it was on the side of inclusiveness rather than abbreviation; that he often tried to report verbatim in the interests of verisimilitude”.[^10] As stated previously, the intended audience is primarily those who would refer to it for use as precedent. The thrust of the source, from the perspective of Lord Mansfield, is that slavery is morally wrong, and can only be upheld by previously existing legislation, and under case law, Mansfield believes that the statute cannot be upheld. This is of large value to the historian, because Mansfield’s view on slavery would be used as precedent in future cases, and the interpretation of this thrust was the main factor in the outcome of these cases. The tone also adds value in a similar way: Mansfield’s condemnation of slavery as “odious” and his appeal to morality make his interpretation of the law very hostile to slavery, which would go on to influence future cases. Thus, we can conclude that this source is of value to the historian, due to the high likelihood of historical accuracy, and it being one of the very few primary accounts that exist of Mansfield’s ruling. It is also valuable because it relays the thoughts and attitudes of Mansfield himself, which would be used as precedent in future verdicts on similar cases. However, it does have limitations: Lofft’s interpretation cannot conclusively be said to be the correct one - it is argued that we will never truly know what Mansfield said.[^11] Additionally, the book in which the account appears was published 44 years later, and this leaves some room for bias or inaccuracy. Peer review of Howell’s work and comparison with the few other accounts of the case allow us to conclude that the source is mostly of sound accuracy, but the fact that the book was published in 1816, during a period of popular abolitionist sentiment raises doubts over whether it was doctored to pander to abolitionist sympathies. Therefore, whilst there is evidence to show that the source is largely useful to the historian, its limitations in terms of accuracy leave room for doubt over its value.

The reason that Mansfield did not declare a prohibition of chattel slavery altogether was fear of political division and distrust in the court system.[^12] Granville Sharp had intended to use it as a test case to set a precedent and to effectively outlaw slavery in Britain, and Somerset's case certainly lived up to Sharp's expectations.[^13] As the highest judge presiding at the highest common law court in the land, anything that Mansfield ruled would be set as precedent for any similar future cases. Thus, ruling that James Somerset was to go free allowed for other individuals and their representatives across the country to plead their case before the courts, citing Somerset Vs Stewart as precedent. This was very important, as the ability to cite the case was a legal framework created by Mansfield in order to do "as much damage to the legitimacy of the slaveowners” position as possible, short of an outright ruling against them.[^14] Appeals to the court continued in Britain and the United States for the next century.[^15] This was of significance to the eventual abolition of slavery in 1838 because it formed the basis for the gradual emancipation of slaves in Britain and in the colonies. *Somerset* reframed the debate on slavery in Britain. Even minimal gains of civil rights contributed to positive public opinion and a growing abolitionist movement. The importance of the Somerset case as a turning point, however, is limited, because whilst many made attempts to appeal against their status, few were successful, and slaves continued to be recaptured and transported back to British colonies from British soil without being able to appeal their case.[^16] Whilst the Somerset case certainly set an important legal basis for the foundations of the abolition of the slave trade and later slavery itself, its lack of frequent practical use and the fact that it was largely ignored by slave traders of the time causes me to conclude that it is not the most important turning point in the struggle to abolish slavery in the British empire.

The Slave Trade Act of 1807 was an act of parliament that abolished the British slave trade. Whilst it did not abolish slavery altogether, and those who were already enslaved remained so, it did serve to entirely abolish the trade of slaves. This broke the cycle of the slave trade, which was a major aspect of the British economy at the time. Previously, the British would buy slaves from Africa and ship them to the Caribbean; offload them and take loads of sugar and other important goods; sail back to Britain to sell the sugar; and then use this money to buy more slaves.[^17] This process would then be repeated and would bring major profits to the traders. The importance of sugar to the economy cannot be understated. By 1775, the share of British imports that originated in the Caribbean, the vast majority of which was sugar (making up 90% of Jamaica's exports.[^18] This had a major impact on the emancipation in 1838, as popular disapproval was a major reason for abolition.[^19] The 1807 Slave Trade Act was clearly a major catalyst in the struggle to abolish slavery altogether in the British colonies, contributing almost solely to the decline of British sugar imports, therefore significantly reducing the value of the colonies to Britain and furthering the abolition campaign. However, this economic viewpoint does have substantial limitations. Eric Williams’ position exemplifies this.

Williams, in his 1944 book *Capitalism and Slavery* posits that the most important turning point in the struggle for abolition was American independence in 1783.[^20] His interpretation is that the loss of the North American colonies following the war of independence significantly devalued the Caribbean islands for the British, and it was due to purely economic forces that the slave trade was abolished - it had simply become unprofitable. Williams argues that the slave trade was the victim of “mature industrial capitalism”.[^21]

There are certainly some merits in this interpretation. Williams is correct to say that there was an economic decline resulting from the slave trade subsequent to the loss of the 13 colonies in 1983, and this certainly played some part in the abolition of the slave trade (see above), although the effects were more delayed than he asserts.[^22] He does, however, place too much emphasis on this viewpoint, and whilst he does not ignore the humanitarian aspect of abolition altogether, the reader of *Capitalism and Slavery* feels that they only get a cursory glance at most into this multifaceted subject. Williams attempts to keep his reader convinced that the economics of the slave were the primary reason for its downfall, and in doing this limits himself to a black-and-white viewpoint.

Williams tends to make sweeping, unsubstantiated statements in order to support his view: at one point, he argues that prior to 1773, “all classes in English society presented a united front with regard to the slave trade”, and also asserts that “the ‘horrors’ of the Middle Passage have been exaggerated”.[^23] The former statement can be easily debunked: the existence of the Clapham sect, the early quaker movement, and the words of Lord Mansfield (see above) can all be used as counter-evidence; and the latter’s error is made clear through documented slave mortality rates on these voyages (whilst mortality did decrease to just over 5% in the 1790s, prior to this it had been approximately 16%) - the Middle Passage was as hellish as it comes.[^24]

Williams’ interpretation is also subject to external influences. He admitted himself that he owed much to the ideas of Lowell Ragatz, specifically his book *The Fall of the Planter class in the British Caribbean*.[^25] Further, his Oxford education was a major contributor to his viewpoint: his tutor, Sir Reginald Coupland, held markedly ‘whiggish’ views on the British empire and abolition, proposing that the entire conquest of empire was a benevolent one. Having personally experienced the consequences of slavery in his youth living in Trinidad and Tobago, a former slave colony, Williams found this view repulsive, arguing that the humanitarian aspect of abolition was "seriously misunderstood and grossly exaggerated by men who have sacrificed scholarship to sentimentality and, like the scholastics of old, placed faith before reason and evidence”.[^26] Williams’ West Indian upbringing heavily prejudiced him against many alternative theories to his own, and so his writing is not necessarily balanced.[^27] Coupland’s focus on humanitarianism (a viewpoint founded in order to support the wider whig interpretation) turned Williams away from whig history and towards his focus on economic factors, which in turn caused his narrow view of the subject. Williams was also heavily influenced by the writings of Marx, his education of Marxist views stemming from his Trinidadian teacher, and his notion that social developments are intrinsically linked to economic developments is inherently marxist.[^28] Williams is known to have reserved stinging criticism for those historians who ignored Britain’s role in perpetuating the slave trade, and free-market economists who encouraged capitalism.[^29] Such external influence which resulted in large prejudices creates an interpretation that is not entirely Williams’ own, and stemmed from a rebellion against the status quo of his contemporaries.

Williams’ interpretation of the most important turning point was largely biased by personal and political tendencies, and a relatively limited scope. This not only serves to point out flaws in Williams’ own interpretation, but significantly limits the effectiveness of the argument that the 1807 Slave Trade Act was the most important turning point in the struggle for the abolition of slavery, as it debases the argument from economic viability.

The role of religion in the anti-slavery movement cannot be understated, and a major turning point came in the founding of the first anti-slavery organisation by the Quakers. The Quaker movement had previously written an anti-slavery statement in 1688 in Germantown, Pennsylvania (based upon strong religious condemnation and ethical concerns).[^40] Records show that English quakers began to express their disapproval and promote reforms as early as 1727: a statement from the London Yearly Meeting of Quakers reads:

> “The answer given by the Correspondents here to Friends of Pensilvenia [sic] the Jerseys the 17th of the 6 month 1713 by the Yearly Meeting & their Answer to the Friends of Pensilvenia [sic] the 3rd of the 8 month 1715 both containing the Sence [sic] of this Meeting that the Importing of Negroes from their native Country and Relations is not a Commendable nor Allowed Practice which Answers and Sense is approved & the Practice censured by the Meeting & this Minute is ordered to be Sent by Benjamin Bealing to Friends In the Plantations abroad, as well as to the Several Quarterly Meetings at Home.”
>
> Minutes of the London Yearly Meeting, as transcribed from Fig. 1 (See Appendix A)

This opinion is taken from the recorded minutes of the London Yearly Meeting 1727, an annual meeting of Quakers. The meeting is responding to a correspondence from another meeting in Pennsylvania, who had formally condemned slavery.[^41] The origin of this source is of value to the historian studying turning points in the leadup to the abolition of slavery because of its relatively early date: fifty years before the Mansfield ruling, this source is the first instance of a major British religious movement formally rebuking the transatlantic slave trade. The author of this source is unknown - all that can be discovered about them is that they were an influential quaker (this can be inferred from their position in the London Yearly Meeting). This somewhat reduces credibility and value to the historian studying the religious aspect of the abolition of slavery, although knowing the religious denomination of the individual mitigates this to a certain extent. Likewise, the fact that this was published in the minutes of the meeting implies that it is the official stance of the Quaker movement, thus mitigating the otherwise dubious credibility of the source. The purpose is to inform the wider Quaker movement about the position of the Meeting. This is of value to the historian because the purpose means that the statement is likely to be well-thought out and detailed, giving the historian a better view of the position of the Meeting. The intended audience is the wider quaker movement. The intended audience and the purpose cause limitations to arise however: the limited intended transmission of this view means that there is a possibility that it is not formatted for wider consumption - i.e. it is intended to appeal solely to other Quakers rather than the general public. The thrust of the source is that the practise of slavery is “not a Commendable nor Allowed practise”. The implication that the official stance of the Quaker movement in 1727 was abolitionist is of significant value to the historian, because it demonstrates an early precedent for opposition towards slavery in religious circles - this counters the claims of some historians who seek to argue that there was no opposition in British society (See the evaluation of Eric Williams’ Capitalism and Slavery). Furthermore, the wide distribution of this condemnation and censure, as attested to by the statement that “this Minute is ordered to be sen by Benjamin Bealing to Friends in the Plantations abroad, as well as to the Several Quarterly Meetings at home”, is also of value to the historian, as it demonstrates the widespread influence of the quakers, which allows the historian to understand the influence of religion on abolition. In sum, the source is largely of value: it demonstrates the widespread influence of the Quaker movement, their official position on slavery, and that there was opposition to slavery even in the early 18th century. It is, however, limited to an extent, due to unknown precise authorship (and therefore lack of knowledge about bias or political tendencies), and due to the intended audience being limited to the Quaker movement, which means that wider influence was small.

Further resolutions followed in 1758, 1761, and 1783.[^42] This network was vital in furthering abolitionism into the public eye, circulating anti-slavery literature, promoting the sales of memorabilia (perhaps the most famous example of which is the 'Am I not a man and a brother?' medallion), organising boycotts and lectures, and crucially, gathering signatures to append to anti-slavery petitions presented to Parliament.[^43] A structured organisation system was needed, and the Society was the very thing to bring about change and to bring the abolitionist cause to light. Drawing support from all walks of life, the Society was able to gather massed public support, and present it to parliament through abolitionist elements within the Commons. The Quakers (as well as some Evangelical Christians) played an enormous part in the organisation and mobilisation of the abolitionist campaign, and thus were a cornerstone of the struggle for abolition. In addition to this, the Quaker’s enthusiasm for abolition was taken up by other religious organisations as well: the Clapham Sect (a major abolitionist movement) was founded by some of those who had founded the Society, and Methodists were also strongly in favour of abolition as a result of the influence of the Quakers: the Methodist Conference told Methodists before the 1830 General Election to use their vote to help secure abolition.[^44] The 1727 declaration was an important turning point in itself, as were the subsequent resolutions by the Quaker movement, because of the long-term changes that it brought throughout the 18th century, indirectly resulting in the abolition of slavery.

Ernest Howse’s interpretation in *Saints in Politics*, published in 1951, has a very different view of the topic to Williams. As the title suggests, Howse’s view that it was the efforts of religiously-motivated abolitionists that was the main driving force behind abolition. He specifically identifies the establishment of the Clapham Sect in 1780 as a turning point in the struggle for abolition.

Howse presents a highly plausible interpretation. The Clapham Sect’s membership included such prominent names as William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson, and Granville Sharp, among others, all of whom are known to have had a significant impact upon the abolition of slavery: Wilberforce as the parliamentarian promoter of abolition, Clarkson as a leader of the movement, Sharp as the legal tactician. Their importance is agreed upon across the field of study.[^45] This consensus gives Howse’s interpretation significant credibility.

Howse’s background was as a pastor and a minister, and later 21st moderator of the United Church of Canada.[^46] As such, his motivation for writing *Saints in Politics* comes from a place of a deep devotion to Christianity. This influenced his focus on the religious aspect of religion, and in a similar way to Williams, Howse’s interpretation is relatively narrow. This is not necessarily damning - the view retains merit as a well-researched and thorough account - but it is argued by commentators that “secularists may find less to praise in the Rev. Dr. Howse's book than those with religious sympathies”.[^47] It is, however, the opinion of certain reviewers that Howse remained unbiased during his authorship - Curtis argues that he gives the Claphamites “only the credit which they justly and rightfully deserve”.[^48] It is the opinion of this author that Howse indeed provides an unbiased and comprehensive account of the deeds of the Clapham Sect, and does not allow what may have had the potential to become a religious myopia to distract him from a truthful exposition. 

A major criticism of Howse’s view is that the Clapham Sect and the wider community of Evangelical Christians inflated the value of William Wilberforce’s contributions, and claimed that the success of leading abolitionists could be attributed to their belief in the holy trinity.[^49] Indeed, Wilberforce wrote little on abolition outside of parliamentary contribution.[^50] Howse may perhaps also be criticised for his lack of documentation and citation, however his views are mostly accurate and widely agreed upon in the general consensus. Howse’s interpretation is widely sound, relatively free of the bias that might be expected of such a devoted Christian, and agreed upon by many leading academics in the field.

Another major turning point in the abolition of slavery was the passing of the Great Reform Act (The Representation of the People Act) in 1832. It served as an attempt to enfranchise much of the population of Britain, creating 67 new constituencies and giving a significant proportion of the middle and upper classes the right to vote.[^51] Previously, voting had been limited to upper classes, and the electorate had had little independence or power over the candidates which they elected. The Great Reform Act gave both of these things to an expanded electorate, and now, more than ever, would a popular cause such as abolition be influential in the electoral system.[^52] The new House of Commons contained no less than 104 MPs who had pledged to support motions for immediate emancipation of slaves.[^53]

Parliamentary records lend strong support to this argument. The best example is a parliamentary division record from Hansard, the record-keeping system of parliament:

 
> The House divided on the original Motion: Ayes 158; Noes 151—Majority 7 *.*
>
> The House went into Committee, *pro formâ.* Resumed—Committee to sit again.

The debate which it records occurred on 24 July 1833. This is of value to the historian studying the turning points behind the abolition of slavery because of its close proximity to the abolition act of 1833 - indeed, the debate from which it is sourced is a debate on the very act which the historian is studying. The purpose of this source is to provide a voting record on the issue at hand, specifically recording the votes against the motion, namely “that the House resolve itself into Committee on the Abolition of Slavery Bill”.[^54] This is of significant value to the historian, especially when analysing the impact of the Great Reform Act of 1832, because it allows the historian to analyse the impact of newly enfranchised constituencies and the increased accountability which MPs had to their constituency. It is important here to note that this list is of the noes to the motion, which in this case is, in effect, a list of abolitionist elements in this division.[^55] Of the 151 members that voted against the motion, 73 were committed to promoting immediate abolition. They were held to this pledge by their constituents, and had increased responsibility to these electors after the Great Reform Act. As well as the effects of increased responsibility, the effects of enfranchisement can also be seen in this source: when taken with five other minority (i.e. abolitionist) lists from the debate, 80% of newly enfranchised (English and Welsh) boroughs voted in line with the abolitionists, as opposed to the 51% of ‘old’ boroughs that voted in the same way.[^56] Thus, the historian studying the abolition of the slave trade can conclude that the effect of enfranchisement and increased accountability was direct and significant. The intended audience of this source ties in with the accountability aspect of the Great Reform Act: the audience of this voting record was the constituents which these members represented, and as a publicly accessible document, available to those with newfound power to hold MPs to account, this demonstrates to the historian that the effects of the Great Reform Act were to increase accountability, and thus that it was a major factor in the abolition of slavery.

Whilst there was some stalling on the part of certain anti-emancipation campaigners and those who desired a compensatory solution to emancipation (in which Planters would be compensated for their ‘loss’), direct lobbying of ministers ensured that the government would legislate for emancipation: Lord Althorp committed to introducing emancipatory measures to the house by the 23 April 1833 (although this was postponed to 14 May).[^57] These measures would, after some debate and concessions from both sides of the argument, form the basis of the 1833 Abolition of Slavery Act. The admittance of staunch abolitionists to Parliament in the ensured that the movement was able to promote their views and force the hand of the government. It must also be considered, however, that the pressure placed on the government was not entirely from those within Parliament. There was a significant amount of external pressure placed on Members by their constituents: after 15 April, the number of petitions received by Parliament rose to, on average, 75 per day, where they had previously received no more than 150.[^58] The anti-slavery movement which existed outside of Parliament can be argued to have exerted considerably more influence on Members. This limitation is, however, mitigated, as there is a strong case for the argument that the Great Reform Act ensured that these petitions were heeded, because Members were subject to much greater accountability than previously. Even within the House of Lords, where pressure such as this did not exist, Henry Taylor’s assumption that they “Would shrink from the unpopularity which the rejection or essential modification of it would bring upon them” was correct.[^59] We may therefore conclude that the Great Reform Act was a major turning point in the struggle for the abolition of slavery, because without it, it is likely that emancipatory measures would not have been passed due to opposition within Parliament.

In conclusion, I find the 1832 Great Reform Act to be the most important turning point in the struggle for abolition. This is because, without its passage, the popular support for abolition would not have been represented in Parliament, nor would many Members have heeded it. This would have likely prevented the abolition of slavery for many years, if not decades. Whilst the influence of the Somerset vs Stewart case in setting legal precedent, the quaker-established abolition movement, and the Haitian revolution were also important turning points, none had the effect on the image of slavery that led to its abolition that the 1807 slave trade act did.

### Lord Mansfield’s ruling in the Somerset case, as reported by Capell Lofft in Lofft 1, 98 Eng. Rep. 499 (K.B. 1772), as reprinted in T.B. Howell, A Complete Collection of State Trials Vol. XX, 1816. pg. 82

“On the part of Sommersett, the case which we gave notice should be decided this day, the Court now proceeds to give its opinion. I shall recite the return to the writ of Habeas Corpus, as the ground of our determination; omitting only words of form. The captain of the ship on board of which the negro was taken, makes his return to the writ in terms signifying that there have been, and still are, slaves to a great number in Africa; and that the trade in them is authorized by the laws and opinions of Virginia and Jamaica; that they are goods and chattels; and, as such, saleable and sold. That James Sommersett is a negro of Africa, and long before the return of the king's writ was brought to be sold, and was sold to Charles Steuart, esq. then in Jamaica, and has not been manumitted since; that Mr. Steuart, having occasion to transact business, came over hither, with an intention to return; and brought Sommersett to attend and abide with him, and to carry him back as soon as the business should be transacted. That such intention has been, and still continues; and that the negro did remain till the time of his departure in the service of his master Mr. Steuart, and quitted it without his consent; and thereupon, before the return of the king's writ, the said Charles Steuart did commit the slave on board the Anne and Mary, to safe custody, to be kept till he should set sail, and then to be taken with him to Jamaica, and there sold as a slave. And this is the cause why he, captain Knowles, who was then and now is, commander of the above vessel, then and now lying in the river of Thames, did the said negro, committed to his custody, detain; and on which he now renders him to the orders of the Court. We pay all due attention to the opinion of sir Philip Yorke, and Lord chancellor Talbot, whereby they pledged themselves to the British planters, for all the legal consequences of slaves coming over to this kingdom or being baptized, recognized by Lord Hardwicke, sitting as chancellor on the 19th of October, 1749, that trover would lie: that a notion had prevailed, if a negro came over, or became a Christian, he was emancipated, but no ground in law that he and Lord Talbot, when attorney and solicitor general, were of opinion, that no such claim for freedom was valid; that though the statute of tenures had abolished villeins regardant to a manor, yet he did not conceive but that a man might still become a villein in gross, by confessing himself such in open court. We are so well agreed, that we think there is no occasion of having it argued (as I intimated an intention at first) before all the judges, as is usual, for obvious reasons, on a return to a Habeas Corpus. The only question before us is, whether the cause on the return is sufficient? If it is, the negro must be remanded; if it is not, he must be discharged. Accordingly, the return states, that the slave departed and refused to serve; whereupon he was kept, to be sold abroad. So high an act of dominion must be recognized by the law of the country where it is used. The power of a master over his slave has been extremely different, in different countries. The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory. It is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from the decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.”

### The Haitian Declaration of Independence [January 1804]

“The Commander in Chief to the People of Haiti 

Citizens:
It is not enough to have expelled the barbarians who have bloodied our land for two centuries; it is not enough to have restrained those ever-evolving factions that one after another mocked the spectre of liberty that France dangled before you. We must, with one last act of national authority, forever assure the empire of liberty in the country of our birth; we must take any hope of re-enslaving us away from the inhuman government that for so long kept us in the most humiliating torpor. In the end we must live independent or die. 

Independence or death... let these sacred words unite us and be the signal of battle and of our reunion. 

Citizens, my countrymen, on this solemn day I have brought together those courageous soldiers who, as liberty lay dying, spilled their blood to save it; these generals who have guided your efforts against tyranny have not yet done enough for your happiness; the French name still haunts our land… 

…We have dared to be free, let us be thus by ourselves and for ourselves. Let us imitate the grown child: his own weight breaks the boundary that has become an obstacle to him. What people fought for us? What people wanted to gather the fruits of our labour? And what dishonourable absurdity to conquer in order to be enslaved. Enslaved?... Let us leave this description for the French; they have conquered but are no longer free. 

Let us walk down another path; let us imitate those people who, extending their concern into the future, and dreading to leave an example of cowardice for posterity, preferred to be exterminated rather than lose their place as one of the world's free peoples. 

Let us ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy our work; let us allow our neighbours to breathe in peace; may they live quietly under the laws that they have made for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary firebrands, declare ourselves the lawgivers of the Caribbean, nor let our glory consist in troubling the peace of the neighbouring islands. Unlike that which we inhabit, theirs has not been drenched in the innocent blood of its inhabitants; they have no vengeance to claim from the authority that protects them. 

Fortunate to have never known the ideals that have destroyed us, they can only have good wishes for our prosperity.

Peace to our neighbours; but let this be our cry: "Anathema to the French name! Eternal hatred of France!" 

Natives of Haiti! My happy fate was to be one day the sentinel who would watch over the idol to which you sacrifice; I have watched, sometimes fighting alone, and if I have been so fortunate as to return to your hands the sacred trust you confided to me, know that it is now your task to preserve it. In fighting for your liberty, I was working for my own happiness. Before consolidating it with laws that will guarantee your free individuality, your leaders, who I have assembled here, and I, owe you the final proof of our devotion.

Generals and you, leaders, collected here close to me for the good of our land, the day has come, the day which must make our glory, our independence, eternal.

If there could exist among us a lukewarm heart, let him distance himself and tremble to take the oath which must unite us. Let us vow to ourselves, to posterity, to the entire universe, to forever renounce France, and to die rather than live under its domination; to fight until our last breath for the independence of our country.

And you, a people so long without good fortune, witness to the oath we take, remember that I counted on your constancy and courage when I threw myself into the career of liberty to fight the despotism and tyranny you had struggled against for 14 years. Remember that I sacrificed everything to rally to your defence; family, children, fortune, and now I am rich only with your liberty; my name has become a horror to all those who want slavery. Despots and tyrants curse the day that I was born. If ever you refused or grumbled while receiving those laws that the spirit guarding your fate dictates to me for your own good, you would deserve the fate of an ungrateful people. But I reject that awful idea; you will sustain the liberty that you cherish and support the leader who commands you. Therefore vow before me to live free and independent, and to prefer death to anything that will try to place you back in chains. Swear, finally, to pursue forever the traitors and enemies of your independence.

Done at the headquarters of Gonaives, the first day of January 1804, the first year of independence.”
