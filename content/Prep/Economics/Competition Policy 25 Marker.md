## Assess whether the government should intervene to make markets more competitive [25]

</br>

Government intervention in markets is commonplace, in order to make markets fairer and more competitive, and prevent consumer exploitation. However, certain drawbacks exist which cast doubt on the utility of said intervention. In this essay, I shall evaluate the two perspectives on the subject, through analysis of promoting competition to both prevent exploitation of consumers and prevent the loss of competition caused by adverse financial conditions, and shall conclude that the government *should* intervene to make markets more competitive.

One argument in favour of government intervention to make a market more competitive is that it can prevent exploitation of consumers. By preventing mergers to prevent high market concentration, placing price caps and windfall taxes on monopolies to stop them from raising prices, and bringing in monopoly legislation, a government can ensure that consumers are not exploited by large firms. For example, recently in the UK a merger between Asda and Sainsbury’s was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), on the grounds that the combined market share of the two would be so great that they would be able to exercise a significant amount of control over the market. This intervention served to promote competition, so that consumers would have more choice over where they went to shop, and so they would not be exploited by an oligopolistic firm. Another example is the recent prevention of the merger of US airlines JetBlue and Spirit Airlines. This was stopped due to JetBlue’s low prices and fears that by removing them from the market, consumers would have little choice in terms of budget airlines. Intervention had the same effect here too, allowing consumers to have a good choice of firms to buy from. The use of price caps is also common, as is the use of windfall taxes. Large energy firms often have price caps and windfall taxes levied on them, to prevent them from making supernormal profits through raising consumer prices. This allows consumers to pay a fair price for essential resources. Natural monopolies are often the target of these sanctions. This is demonstrated in the diagram below, in which AC increases from AC1 to AC2 (showing the effect of a windfall tax) and therefore supernormal profit decreases from P1-P* to P2-P*, demonstrating the reduction in prices for consumers.

However, there is an argument to be made against preventing exploitation of consumers. Preventing mergers such as the ones mentioned above prevents firms from gaining economies of scale, meaning that firms in a regulated market are not as efficient as they could be: lack of supernormal profit prevents dynamic efficiency from being achieved, as firms do not enough money to invest into R&D and innovation, and a lack of economies of scale prevents the firm from maximising efficiency. Further, a lack of supernormal profits reduces the incentive for new firms to join the market, and so there is stagnation present. However, overall, these drawbacks do not outweigh the positives of a lack of consumer exploitation.

Another use of government intervention to make markets more competitive is government subsidies. If a firm is facing significant financial trouble, then a government can subsidise the firm to bring their costs down and prevent them from shutting down. For example, in the late-20th century, the British government often gave subsidies to such firms, such as Rolls-Royce. This was to prevent loss of competition in the car market. A subsidy will shift supply outwards from S1 to S2, reducing costs and increasing profit, and therefore bring price down, increasing the demand from consumers. This allows the firm to remain competitive. Additionally, jobs will be saved and unemployment will not worsen.

However, there are drawbacks to this method of promoting competition. Firstly, the government’s budgetary position will worsen, as they have to spend more. This may also mean sacrificing other expenditure to prop up these firms. Additionally, as firm may become reliant upon the subsidy, especially if it is poorly managed, and thus it becomes a long-run cost for the government and the taxpayer. However, it can be concluded that the arguments for promoting competition in this way are more convincing than the counter-arguments.

From these arguments, we may conclude that it is in the best interest of all parties for the government to intervene in order to increase competition in markets. Consumers are not exploited, and firms can be supported in a financial crisis. Therefore, the view is valid.
