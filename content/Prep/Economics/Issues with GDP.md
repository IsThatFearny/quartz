# Issues with GDP

</br>

## Problems with GDP

- GDP does not reflect PPP of a country. You can buy a lot more in one country with $1000 USD than you could in another
- Official statistics may not measure black market or non-profit activity, and therefore may misreport
- Does not factor in cost of a high GDP (pollution, congestion, environmental damage, decline in living standards)
- Hours worked are not factored in. A country could force workers to work for long hours, and therefore have a higher GDP, and to the untrained eye this looks as if the country is prospering whereas in reality it is pushing its workforce harder
- Poverty is not taken into account. A country may have high GDP but also high poverty, as small numbers of people own much of the wealth and therefore bring GDP up
- Intangibles such as liberty, freedom, standard of education, etc. are not taken into account
- Unpaid work is not counted
- "GDP measures everything except that which makes life worthwile" - Sen. Robert Kennedy
- As simple as a measure of market activity, goes no deeper
- GDP per capita can increase despite worsening living conditions, e.g. three richest men in the US have more wealth than the bottom half of the population, so GDP is skewed
- Makes assumptions
- Large disconnect between GDP and societal wellbeing

## Alternatives to GDP
- Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)
	- GDP is the base
	- Takes into account other factors such as:
		- Pollution
		- Poverty rates
		- Health standards
		- Inequality Rates
		- Crime
		- Pollution cost
		- Education value
- Human Development Index (HDI)
	- Composed of:
		- Life expectancy index
		- Education index
		- Income Index (Based on GNI)
- Gross National Happiness (GNH)
	- Factors used include:
		- Psychological Wellbeing
		- Education
		- Health
		- Distribution of time
		- Cultural Diversity
		- Ecological Diversity
		- Living standards
	- Four pillars are:
		- Sustainable and equitable socio-economic development
		- Environmental Conservation
		- Preservation and promotion of culture
		- Good governance
- Green GDP
	- Takes into account cost of resource depletion and environmental damage

All of these measures take into account more than just economic activity: they also look at living standards, societal wellbeing, environmental impact, education and other important factors which are perhaps more telling of a country's performance than GDP is
