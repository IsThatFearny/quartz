# Quantity Theory of Money 9 Marker

</br>

**The Global Context Extract C** (lines 12−13) states that the Quantity Theory of Money ‘predicts a direct relationship between increases in the money supply and increases in the price level’.

Explain the term ‘price level’ **and** analyse how increases in the money supply of an economy may bring about increases in the price level in that economy.

The price level is the average price of goods and services across an economy. It is determined by the laws of demand and supply, but can also be determined by the money supply in the economy. This is the Quantity Theory of Money, which states that increases in the money supply have a proportional effect on the price level. The equation used to calculate this relationship is the ‘fisher equation’, $MV = PT$, where M represents the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P represents the 
price level, and T is the velocity of transactions. V is assumed to be constant, and T is stable in terms of M, and therefore changes in the money supply directly affect the price level. 

The reasoning behind this theory is that if there is an increase in the money supply, this will allow consumers to spend more and firms to invest more, because they have more money to spend. This would cause more aggregate demand (as consumption and investment are components of this), and the result would be an increase in the price level. The diagram below demonstrates this, showing that a shift in AD to the right from AD1 to AD2, representing an increase in aggregate demand, will result in an increase in the price level from P1 to P2.

An increase in the money supply of an economy can be brought about in different ways. Government borrowing is occasionally financed by printing more money - Dennis Healey termed it ‘confetti money’ in the 1970s. Additionally, money can flow into the economy from abroad, in the form of foreign investment, tourism, or high imports. A central bank may also adjust the money supply to respond to economic circumstances, such as deflation, which would require more money to be injected into the economy.
