# Monetary Policy 15 Marker

</br>

Since 1998, the Bank of England has had responsibility for the operation of monetary policy and maintaining price stability. In response to the financial crisis of 2007–08, the Financial Services Act 2012 gave the Bank of England overall responsibility for financial stability. This was designed to reduce systemic risk and the impact on the real economy of problems that arise in financial markets.

Explain how the monetary policy transmission mechanism works when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raises Bank Rate.

Monetary Policy is policy which aims to control the money supply, and to achieve economic growth and other macroeconomic objectives. In the UK, the Bank of England (our central bank) controls monetary policy, and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) are in charge of raising the bank rate. The Bank Rate is the main rate of interest (debt increase on a loan, or savings appreciation is a savings account) which is passed onto consumers through commercial banks. The main objective that the MPC aims towards is low inflation (2%), which is a minimal increase in the general price level in an economy.

When the MPC raises the bank rate, this passes onto commercial banks through the reserve market. Commercial banks raise their interest rates, and it becomes more expensive to take out a loan or a mortgage, but becomes more worthwhile to save money as savings appreciate more under higher interest rates. If it is more expensive to take out a loan, then less people will want them, and in turn, people will feel that they have less money to spend. This decreases Aggregate Demand, which slows the economy down and decreases inflation. In addition to this, people will be more likely to save money in order to gain a higher return from it, also decreasing Aggregate Demand as people are not consuming, but saving. This, again, decreases inflation. It can also be noted that if interest rates increase, then the amount that is needed to pay back a mortgage will also increase. This causes the housing market to decline, as fewer people are taking out mortgages, and causes homeowners to feel poorer, yet again decreasing Aggregate Demand and Inflation. The effect is similar on firms, who invest less in capital goods due to more expensive loans. All of these factors decrease AD, and therefore inflation as well.

An increase in the bank rate will also affect the exchange rate. Higher interest rates will attract more investment from abroad. This causes more money to flow into the country, and in turn this causes an increase in the currency’s value due to an increase in demand for the currency. Therefore, export value goes up.

Since 2020, interest rates have been increasing in the UK, from 0.25% in early 2020 to nearly 4% now, at the start of 2023. This has been an attempt to slow down rampant inflation, which is currently at 10.6%. However, interest rates take approximately two years to have any actual effect, and the rise in interest rates perhaps came too late to stop runaway inflation such as the rates that we are seeing right now.

The diagram below demonstrates how a decrease in Aggregate Demand will lead to a decrease in the price level and therefore inflation.
