# Multiplier 9 Marker

Extract D (lines 22−23) argues that government spending ‘can initiate a powerful stimulus to an economy through the multiplier process’. 

With the help of a diagram analyse the possible impact of the multiplier effect on an economy’s unemployment and economic growth. 

--- 

The multiplier effect can be observed when there is an injection into the economy. This injection will result in a more-than-proportional increase in national income, and this is the multiplier effect. Thus, due to a change in national income, it follows that there will also be widespread effects on unemployment and economic growth.

An increase in national income will increase the incentive to seek work (as more money is available for those in work). This means that, whilst unemployment will initially rise because of the transition period whilst people look for work, when these people find jobs, unemployment will decrease significantly. 

It follows from this decrease in unemployment and increase in national income that demand in the economy will be stimulated - people have a higher income, and the additional money will likely be spent on consumer goods and services (the extent of this is dependent on marginal propensity to save/consume). This increase in consumption (a component of aggregate demand) will cause an increase in AD from AD1 to AD3 (as shown in the diagram below) that goes beyond the initial increase from AD1 to AD2 that the initial injection caused. 

The multiplier effect is also recursive: more consumption means that supply will be increased to meet demand, and this will require more workers; thus, more jobs are created, unemployment falls, and consumption yet again increases. Increased profits for firms who’s goods are in higher demand will also cause a rise in AD, due to higher rates of investment.
