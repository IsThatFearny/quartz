Extract E (lines 4–6) states: ‘…the report suggested that significant increases in spending would be required to help improve the wellbeing of the UK population’.

Use the extracts and your knowledge of economics to assess the view that a long-term, significant increase in government spending would be beneficial for the UK economy.

Increased government spending would have many benefits to the UK economy, if the money is spent on the ‘right’ things. For example, if additional spending is given to the education sector, then labour productivity will increase as a result (after a few years, of course), causing a long-term increase in supply as firms become more efficient. Further, if spending is used for subsidies, there will be a substantial increase in aggregate demand, because firms can bring down prices, causing higher consumption. This will have the effect of an increase in the rate of economic growth (as consumption is a component of AD). Furthermore, an increase in spending on public infrastructure (e.g. the building of new roads) will create jobs, and improve the standards of living for the population of the UK. This in turn will increase consumption, thus increasing AD and the rate of economic growth as well.

On the other hand, an increase in government spending could have major negative consequences for the UK economy, specifically in terms of budget balance. If government spending exceeds revenue earned from taxation over a year, then the budget deficit will increase. This will cause government borrowing to increase as well (as it did  in 2020-21, up to £350 billion). This may require an increase in taxation in order to supplement spending, which would slow down economic growth and reduce aggregate demand (as consumers now have less with which to spend in the economy). Additionally, in certain situations, the government will attempt to pay off national debt caused by the budget deficit by printing money, which will create significant inflationary pressures. Further to this, an increased budget deficit and national debt will cause the private industry to be crowded out, as government bond increases reduce the amount of money available for investment in the private sector.
