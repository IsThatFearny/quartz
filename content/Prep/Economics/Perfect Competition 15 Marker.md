# Perfect Competition 15 Marker

</br>

### Explain how, if a firm is making supernormal profit in the short term in a perfectly competitive market, they will end up making normal profit in the long term (15)

</br>

The short-run is the situation in which one factor of production is fixed, and the long-run is where all factors of production are variable. A perfectly competitive market is a market in which firms sell homogenous goods for which there are many substitutes, there is perfect information, and no barriers to entry or exit.

In the short-run in a perfectly competitive market, firms are able to make supernormal profit (when average revenue exceeds average cost). This is because, in perfect competition, firms are price-takers, meaning they have no control over the market price. This means that average revenue is equal to marginal revenue and also equal to the market price, as represented in the diagram below (in the form of the P = D = AR = MR curve). Firms must also keep costs to a minimum to prevent themselves from being priced out of the market (this can be seen in the diagram below, where the MC curve intersects with the AC curve at its lowest point, thus minimising costs). In addition to this, a firmâ€™s output in a perfectly competitive market is determined by the point of profit maximisation, which is represented in the diagram by the intersection of the MC and the P curves. This has the potential to lead to a situation in which average revenue exceeds average cost, and so firms are able to make supernormal profit.

However, in the long-run, this will not be possible, because firms which are not currently in the market are incentivised to join the market because of the supernormal profits being made. They can do this easily, because there are no barriers to entry in perfect competition. The resultant increase in supply will drive the market price down. The diagram below demonstrates this, with the supply curve experiencing a shift outwards from S1 to S2, and therefore decreasing the market price from P1 to P2. This will also reduce average revenue due to a reduction in price that is more than the increase in output, bringing AR back into equilibrium with AC, and therefore firms can no longer make supernormal profit.

Whilst a purely perfect market only exists in theory, this point can be demonstrated by the example of the agricultural market. This market has many firms competing, selling near identical products (milk, pork, etc.) with barriers to entry very low. Information is easy to obtain and to compare at markets. If the agricultural industry is prospering in the short run, then new firms are willing and able to join the market with ease, increasing supply and driving price downwards, preventing firms from making supernormal profit.
