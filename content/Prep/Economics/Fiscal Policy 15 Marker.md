# Fiscal Policy 15 Marker

</br>

In 2013, two key aims of the UK Government were: to move the budget deficit towards a surplus over the course of the Parliament and to ensure that the main burden of deficit reduction would be through reduced government spending, rather than increased taxation.

Explain the possible demand-side consequences of an increase in taxation in the UK.

Direct taxation is the amount of revenue that is taken from the profits of a person or a company, and can have wide-ranging effects on the economy, especially on the demand side. Taxation is controlled through fiscal policy, which is the manipulation of taxation and government spending in order to achieve macroeconomic objectives. In this case, the objective that is being aimed at is the reduction of a budget deficit, which is the case in which the government is spending more than they are gaining from taxation. 

An increase in taxation levied on consumers may result in lower aggregate demand. Higher taxation means that a household has less money to spend, resulting in a higher marginal propensity to save, and a lower marginal propensity to consume. Consumption will decrease, and as consumption is a component of AD, this will also decrease. However, this effect may be balanced out. From higher taxation, the government will increase their revenue. They will therefore be able to put this extra money back into the economy in the form of public services, subsidies, etc., and due to government spending being a component of AD, aggregate demand will increase again, bringing it back closer to if not to equilibrium. 

An increase in taxation on firms will also serve to decrease aggregate demand. Increasing corporation tax will decrease the output of the firm, as they have less money to spend on production. To return output to its pre-tax level, the firm may pass on their extra costs to consumers. This will cause prices to rise, decreasing aggregate demand even further, as people are less likely to spend money (which they now have less of) on more expensive goods.

Recently in the UK, the chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced that from April 2023 corporation tax will be raised from 19% to 25%. This is likely to cause an increase in prices of goods, reducing aggregate demand, and slowing down inflation (a macroeconomic objective).

Higher taxation will reduce budget deficit, as the government will increase their revenue, while allowing their government spending to remain the same. However, it can also have negative effects on the economy, and the resulting decrease in aggregate demand is not always beneficial. Therefore, it can be better to decrease government spending rather than to reduce taxation.

The diagram below shows a left shift in AD, demonstrating how taxation will affect aggregate demand on the whole (despite increase government revenue). The price level will shift from to P1 to P2, and output will be decreased from D1 to D2.
