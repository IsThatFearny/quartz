# What is Bentham's Quantitative Utilitarianism?

</br>

## a) Introduction to Utilitarianism
</br>

### Explain the three claims that define utilitarianism in its simplest form

- What is right? Utilitarianism is based on consequentialism, and an act can be considered to be 'right' if it maximises what is considered to be 'good'
- What is good? Utilitarianism states that the only thing that can be good is happiness (pleasure and the absence of pain). this is known as 'hedonism'
- Who counts? Utilitarianism has a commitment to equality, so no one's happiness comes before another's
</br>

### What does it mean to 'maximise happiness'

Maximising happiness means that the greatest number of people are as happy as they possibly can be
</br>

### What is the 'greatest happiness'?
The greatest happiness is the criteria for an act to be right. Even if an act provides some happiness to people, if another act could have led to more happiness, then it was not the right course of action. The act that you undertake must provide the greatest happiness when compared to all other acts
</br>

### What is 'act utilitarianism'?
In act utilitarianism, the only thing that matters is happiness. It seems a clear and simple way to make decisions, by maximising happiness for the greatest number. Act utilitarianism uses consequences to guide decision making, and these consequences can be proved empirically
</br>
</br>

## (b) Bentham's quantitative utilitarianism
</br>

### Explain the principle of 'utility'
The principle of utility can be described as 'the greatest happiness for the greatest number'. It is the guiding principle of act utilitarianism, claiming that when judging actions to be morally right or wrong, we should only take into account the happiness or 'utility' that said action will bring
</br>

### Explain what Bentham means by Utility
Bentham defines utility as a 'property in any object, whereby it tens to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness, or to prevent the happening of mischief, pain, evil or unhappiness to the party who's interest is concerned'. What Bentham means by this is that Utility is a property that makes an action 'right' due to it bringing happiness or preventing unhappiness
</br>

### Explain Bentham's 'felicific calculus' (also known as 'hedonic' or 'utility' calculus) for measuring pleasure or pain
Bentham claimed that we could measure pleasure and pain on a single scale, using the process of 'felicific calculus'. Through this method, 'if a pleasure is more intense, will last longer, is more certain to occur, will happen sooner rather than later, or will produce in turn many other pleasures and few pains, it counts for more'(*Philosophy for AS and A Level, Lacewing, p. 207*). In addition, the more people that you positively affect through your actions, the better. The total amount of happiness produced is the sum total of everyone's pleasure's produced minus the sum total of everyone's pains.
</br>

### What is the 'intuitive appeal' of Bentham's utilitarianism?
Bentham's utilitarianism has 'intuitive appeal' for one main reason. Everyone cares about happiness (Bentham claims that this is in fact the sole thing that motivates people). If happiness is good, then it is perfectly reasonable to want more of it, so we should therefore maximise it. In addition, treating people as equal is an appealing method
</br>

### How might Bentham's utilitarianism be criticised as simplistic and/or narrow?
 - Happiness is *not* the only good
 - We cannot empirically investigate happiness
 - There are circumstances in which we should not maximise happiness
 - While morality may not have something to do with happiness, it is narrow-minded to confine morality to a single measure of 'good'
