# Design Arguments


</br>

### Does Paley’s argument successfully answer Hume’s objections based on drawing analogy between the universe and human artefacts?

Yes: Paley’s argument is not one from analogy. He does not argue that natural things are *like* watches, and so their causes are not *like* the causes of watches. He argues that watches have a property - i.e. the organisation of parts for a purpose - which supports the inference of a designer. Everything that has this property has a cause, including natural things. Therefore, because natural things have this same property, we can infer that they too have a designer.

### Does Paley’s argument successfully answer Hume’s objections concerning the problem of inferring that the universe is designed because it is a unique case?

Paley’s argument is that, even if we had never seen a watch being made and could not understand how it was possible, we would still be correct to conclude, upon examination, that it was designed. We have enough knowledge about the causes of the organisation of the parts to serve a purpose to be able to infer that, whenever we come across such organisation, that it has been designed. The same argument can be applied to nature: all we need to know is the organisation of parts for a purpose, because this is sufficient grounds to infer that something is designed, and that therefore a designer exists.

### Explain Paley’s defence of the claim that the best explanation of order in nature is a mind

Paley rules out alternative explanations of the order that we see in nature, as per Hume’s argument. He accepts that there is a possibility that finite matter has taken all possible combinations over infinite time. However, he argues, this is a worse explanation than the idea of a designer, because there is no evidence that either 1) matter constantly pushes into new forms, or 2) all possible combinations of matter have already been tried. Paley claims that minds supply the only explanation of design we know of, and so the existence of a designer is the best explanation of the organisation of parts for a purpose.

### What is the problem of Spatial Disorder and how does Paley respond to it?

The problem of spatial disorder is that there are vast areas of the universe that contain no organisation of parts, nor any purpose. How, therefore, can we say that these areas were designed, or at least designed by God?

Paley questions the strength of this objection: he claims that the inference from the organisation of parts for a purpose to a designer is correct, even if the watch sometimes went wrong or if some parts are unnecessary in achieving its purpose. In a similar vein, Paley argues that evidence of some imperfections and irregularities in nature does not undermine the inference that nature is designed, and we need not weigh one against the other in order to draw this conclusion.

### Explain the objection to Paley’s claim that the best explanation of order in nature is a mind based on the theory of evolution by natural selection

The objection argues that Paley was wrong in arguing that the organisation of parts for a purpose can only be the effect of a mind. If there is an argument that is better than invoking the existence of a designer, then Paley’s argument fails. 

Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection is an excellent account of how the appearance of design can arise without being the work of a designer. Darwin’s theory of evolution is simpler than the idea of a designer: there is no inference of something brand new, rather it appeals to what we already know exists.

### What is the difference between spatial and temporal order?

[[Philosophy/Glossary#Temporal order|Temporal order]] is the order in which things follow each other, e.g. if you let go of something, it will fall to earth. These temporal regularities accord to the laws of nature. [[Philosophy/Glossary#Spatial order|Spatial order]] is the order that allows matter to be organised into parts that serve a purpose.

### Outline Swinburne’s argument that science cannot explain the operation of the fundamental laws of nature

Swinburne argues that all explanations of the laws of nature presuppose other laws. Laws can be explained in terms of more general laws, but nothing else. We cannot explain the most fundamental laws of nature by science (and if we could, they would not be the most fundamental laws).

In other words, science must make an assumption about these fundamental laws if it wants to provide any explanation whatsoever.

### Explain the difference between scientific and personal explanation

Scientific explanation is a method of explaining things using a scientific method. Personal explanation is explanations in terms of a person, i.e. a rational, free agent. We can explain an object or an event in terms of a person and their purposes.

</br>

### Outline and explain Swinburne’s design argument

Swinburne argues as follows:

P1: There are some temporal regularities, e.g. related to human actions, that are explained in terms of persons.

P2: There are other temporal regularities, e.g. related to the operation of the laws of nature, that are similar to those explained in terms of persons.

C1: So we can, by analogy, explain the regularities relating to the operation of the laws of nature in terms of persons

P3: There is no scientific explanation of the operation of the laws of nature

P4: As far as we know, there are only two types of explanation - scientific and personal

C2: Therefore, there is no better explanation of the regularities relating to the operation of the laws of nature than the explanation in terms of persons. 

C3: Therefore, the regularities relating to the operation of the laws of nature are produced by a person.

C4: Therefore, such a person, who can act on the entire universe, exists.

</br>

### What is Swinburne’s defence against Hume’s criticisms and is it successful?

Swinburne argues that we choose human reason as a model for explaining the operation of the laws of nature because other causes of order in the universe are reliant on the operation of the laws of nature which they don’t themselves explain.

Further, if applying Hume’s idea of spatial order being the result of random changes in matter distribution to temporal order, we must either say that there are no laws of nature, or that the laws of nature change over time, randomly producing order or disorder. However, both of these alternatives are highly problematic: we have no reason to say that there are no laws of nature, and every reason to think that there are. Perhaps the laws of nature could change randomly over time, but given the amount of order in the universe and the universal applicability of the laws of nature, this is a poor explanation of our experience. Swinburne’s overall argument is that explaining temporal regularities in personal terms remains the best explanation.

### Explain the argument that even if the explanation in terms of a designer is technically the ‘best’ we still might not accept it if it isn’t a good explanation, and Swinburne’s response

We might object that, for the designer to be a satisfactory explanation of design in nature, we would need to explain the designer. A mind is as complex and as ordered as nature, and so if the order in nature requires an explanation, so does the order of a designer’s mind.

Swinburne argues that this misrepresents explanation. There are many examples of explanation which doesn’t assume what is assumed in the explanation. This is entirely normal, and has happened repeatedly throughout the history of science. We can therefore still say that the designer is a good explanation for the operation of scientific laws even if we can’t explain the designer.

### Outline Hume’s six objections based on the idea that the designer is more similar to human beings than God is traditionally said to be

1) The scale and quality of the design reflect the power and ability of the designer, an because the universe isn’t infinite, we cannot infer that the designer is infinite. God is thought to be infinite, and so we cannot infer that God is the designer.
2) We have no reason to say that the designer is perfect. There is much evidence of mistakes in designer. If we can prove these mistakes, then we should at the least say that the designer isn’t fully skilled. God, however, is said to be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, and so we cannot infer that the designer is God.
3) Designers are not always creators. God may have created the universe, but he logically does not have to have designed it.
4) The design may have resulted from small improvements made by many people rather than just one person, and we cannot assume that the powers to do this are united in a single being. God, however, is said to be one, and so we have no reason to believe that God is the designer over the possibility of lots of designers that are not divine.
5) Mind is always connected to body. There is no reason to think that the designer has no body, but God is only mind, and so the designer cannot be inferred to be God.
6) Designers can die as their creations continue. The designer could have designed the universe and then died, but God is everlasting and exists eternally, so we cannot infer that the designer is God.

### Outline and assess Swinburne’s response to Hume’s objections

Swinburne accepts arguments 1 and 2. He argues that arguments 3 and 4 can be knocked down by the use of Ockham’s razor: simplicity requires that we shouldn’t suppose the existence of multiple possible causes when only one is required.
