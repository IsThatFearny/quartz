# Functionalism 25 Mark Plan

</br>

### Intro

- Functionalism is the claim that Mental States can be defined in terms of functional states. In this essay, I shall argue that Functionalism does not hold

</br>

### Argument 1: Qualia

- Qualia are non-intentional, intrinsic properties of mental states, i.e. ‘what it is like to drink coffee, feel pain, etc.’. They cannot be defined in terms of causal roles. If qualia exist, then functionalism cannot hold because it maintains that mental states can be defined in terms of causal roles. Qualia exist, and therefore functionalism does not hold.
- The response to this is that this is a very big jump to make. This seems to be a valid response, the argument from qualia does not have any valid argument against the response.

### Argument 2: Block’s China thought experiment

- Block proposes a thought experiment in which the population of China controls your mental and physical states. Each Chinese person has a two way radio. In this way, they create a functional duplicate, but it would be wrong to say that there is a collective Chinese consciousness
- The response to this is that the Chinese are not identical (there is no functional duplicate), because their system can be disrupted (by bad weather, equipment failure, etc.). However, there is an argument that mitigates this: for a moment, a duplicate exists and therefore the argument can hold
- Another response is that this system is slower than the brain, but the functionalist response is that this doesn’t matter, because the same goal is achieved no matter what speed the response is.
- We conclude that Block succeeds, the thought experiment is valid and the responses to objections are strong

### Argument 3: Inverted Qualia

- Say that there are two people, who see a ripe tomato and some grass. They both say that ‘the tomato is red’ and ‘the grass is green’. However, the way that the tomato is for the first person is the way that the grass is for the second person. This means that there are different qualia, despite identical functional states.
- The response to this is that there is no evidence that identical brain function give different qualia. It is also too simple, as colours have unique similarities and differences (i.e. relations to each other).
- If we inverted the whole colour spectrum however, these relations would remain
- We can conclude that we cannot know the experiences of others, and so functionalism is false

### Conclusion

- Functionalism is defeated by though experiments, which prove that our mental states are more than simple functional states
