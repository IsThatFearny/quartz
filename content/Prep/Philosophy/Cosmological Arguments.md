# Cosmological Arguments

</br>

### What characterises cosmological arguments?

The question that characterises these arguments is ‘why does anything exist’? The argument is that unless God exists, this question remains unanswerable.

### Outline and explain the Kalam argument, with particular reference to the claim that an infinite regress of temporal phenomena is impossible

P1: The universe is composed to temporal phenomena that are preceded by other temporal phenomena that are ordered in time.

P2: An infinite regress of temporal phenomena is impossible

C1: Therefore, the universe must have a beginning

P3: Everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence

C2: Therefore, there is a cause of the existence of the universe


To conclude that *God* is the cause of the universe, we must add further premises to the argument, i.e. an argument for accepting P2. Certain paradoxes can be introduced which establish P2 and prove that an infinite regress of temporal phenomena is impossible:

The concept of infinity is not one of a number. You cannot add 1 to infinity to make infinity + 1. It is impossible for there to be an ‘actual infinity’. If we apply this to the universe, then we see a problem: if the universe is infinitely old, then it does not get any older as time passes, and to have reached the present, an infinite amount of time would need to have passed. This is not possible because there is no ‘amount’ of infinity. This is a major problem. Everything that begins to exist in the universe is caused by something preceding it. If, however, there is an infinite regress of causation, then that series never has a starting point, because ∞ + 1 = ∞. We would have never reached the point in this series that we are now at if it were infinite. These paradoxes show that an infinite regress of temporal phenomena is impossible, and so establish P2.

### Explain two differences between a temporal cause and a sustaining cause

A **temporal cause** brings about its affects afterwards, whereas a **sustaining cause** brings about its effect continuously. Likewise, a temporal cause’s effect can continue after the cause ceases, but a sustaining cause depends on the continued existence and operation of the cause.

</br>

### Outline and explain Aquinas’ second way

P1: In the world, we find sustaining causes and effects.

P2: Nothing can depend causally on itself. To do this, it would need to be able to sustain its own existence, and for this to happen it must already exist.

P3: Sustaining causes follow a logical order: the first sustains the second, the second the third, and so on.

P4: If you remove a cause, you remove its effect

C1: Therefore, if there is no first cause, there can be no other causes

P5: If there is an infinite regress of causes, there is no first cause

C2: Therefore, given that there are sustaining causes, there cannot be an infinite regress of causes

C3: Therefore, there must be a first cause which is not itself caused

P6: God is the first cause

C4: Therefore, God exists


Aquinas’ reasoning behind P6 (i.e. God is the first cause) is that our concept of natural things is that they are causally dependent, and their existence is not self-sufficient. This contrasts with our concept of God, a part of which is that god does not depend on anything for his existence. There are no (obvious) similar concepts, and so it makes sense that God is the first cause, because nothing else can be.

### Outline and explain Aquinas’ first way, with reference to Aquinas’ concept of motion and the point that Aquinas is not talking about temporal causes

Aquinas’ First way is based around ‘motion’, by which Aquinas means ‘change’, i.e. how properties change from one thing to another. He understands change in terms of ‘actuality’ and ‘potentiality’: when a change occurs, something that was potential becomes actual, e.g. when water is heated, the cold water starts with the potential to become hot under the right conditions. When heated, this changes, because its potential to be hot is replaced by the water actually being hot.

If this is what Aquinas means by ‘motion’, then a mover is what causes this change. This mover must itself be actual to bring about a change in something else from potential to actual.

Now that this is established, we can state Aquinas’ argumnent:

P1: Some things in the world undergo change

P2: Whatever changes is changed by something, i.e. change is caused. The cause must be something else. Something potential can only be made actual by something that is already actual. 

P3: If $A$ is changed by $B$, and $B$ is changed, then $B$ must have been changed by something else again

P4: If this goes on to infinity, then there is no first cause of change

P5: To remove a cause is to remove its effect

P6: Therefore, if there is no first cause, then there are no other causes - nothing changes

C1: Therefore, there must be a first cause

P7: The first cause is God

C2: Therefore, God exists


The best understanding of this argument is that Aquinas is not talking in terms of temporal causes. He isn’t concerned with these dependencies being changed from potential to actual *temporally* - rather, his thought is that whatever is only potential depends on what is actual. Each thing that changes, was, at some point, potential. As long as we explain change in terms of other things that change, the account is incomplete. To complete our account, we need to finding something that does not change, i.e. that is entirely actual. This is something that is *ontologically prior*.

### Outline and explain Descartes’ cosmological argument

P1: If I cause my own existence, I would give myself all perfections

P2: I do not have all perfections

C1: Therefore, I cannot be the cause of my own existence

P3: A lifespan is composed of independent parts, such that my existence at one time does not entail nor cause my existence in future

C2: Therefore, a cause is needed to keep me in existence, because my existence is not uncaused

P4: I do not have the power to cause my continued existence

C3: Therefore, I must depend on something else to exist

P5: I am a thinking thing and I have the idea of God

P6: There must be as much reality in the cause as in the effect

C4: Therefore, what caused me must be a thinking thing and have the idea of God

P7: Either what caused me is the cause of its own existence, or its existence is caused by another cause

P8: If this existence is caused by another cause, then its cause is either the cause of its own existence, or its existence is caused by another caused.

P9: There cannot be an infinite sequence of causes

C5: Some cause must therefore be the cause of its own existence

P10: This cause must be god

C6: God exists


Descartes supports C2 by arguing that:

P11: There cannot be an infinite chain of causes, because what caused me also causes my continued existence in the present

P12: My parents, or any other temporal cause of my existence, do not keep me in existence

P10 (Again): The only cause that could keep me in existence is God

C6: God exists

### Explain why Descartes claims that his continued existence requires a cause

Something must make it true, rather than false, that he continues to exist. Whatever his continued existence is dependent on must itself continue to exist.

</br>

### Outline two similarities between Descartes’ cosmological argument and Aquians’ second way

One similarity is the claim that the universe has a cause, and does not exist uncaused. Another is that an infinite regress of causes is impossible.
