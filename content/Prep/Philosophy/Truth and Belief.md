# Truth and Belief

## Explain why truth might be considered necessary for knowledge
Truth might be considered necessary for knowledge as a statement must be true to be knowledge. You cannot know something that is false. For example, if you believe that the earth is flat, and you can justify it (or think you can), this is not knowledge, as it is not a true fact about the world, and does not correspond with either the 'web of beliefs' held by society to be true nor the correspondence theory, which states that truth is a belief that is held in accordance with experienced reality.

## Explain why belief might not be considered necessary for knowledge

Belief might not be considered necessary for knowledge, as without justification and truth, belief in itself cannot be considered knowledge. For example, I may believe in a god, but belief alone does not mean that I *know* that there is a god. Belief is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowledge.
