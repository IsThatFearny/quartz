# What is Philosophical Behaviourism?

### What is the problem of other minds as faced by the dualist?

There can be no empirical evidence to test the existence of other minds, and therefore we cannot meaningfully say that other minds are real/exist.
</br>
### How does philosophical behaviourism explain the mind?

Philosophical behaviourism claims that the mind is simply what a person says or does (behaviours). All statements concerning mental states or processes are not concerned with a private world, rather, talk about minds is reducible to talk of behaviour.
</br>

### Explain what is meant by:

#### Analytic behaviourism

Analytic behaviourism is so named because analysis of the language of mind reveals that all can be reduced to statements about behaviour.
#### Analytic reduction.

Analytic reduction means that statements about minds mean the same as statements about behaviour in the same way that ‘mother’ means ‘female parent’.

### How does philosophical behaviourism resolve the issue of other minds?

Philosophical behaviourism argues that we can observe another person’s behaviour, and since behaviour is alike with mind, it is reasonable to believe that said person has a mind, and thus other minds exist.
</br>

### Outline the three arguments for philosophical behaviourism.

1) The dualist admits that we have access to the behaviour of others, and therefore behaviour must be the basis for all of our language about others. Theories such as Ayer’s verification principle reject the idea that other minds could be isolated from the possibility of detection. Talk of things which cannot be verified is meaningless, and the failure to recognise this means that dualists become concerned with the problem of other minds. Behaviourism eliminates this problem by equating mind with what is observable.

2) Behaviourism overcomes the interaction problem that plagues dualism. If the mind is not a distinct substance or property that is somehow linked the body, then there is no causal interaction to account for.

3) If words acquire their meaning from the context in which they are used, then it follows that there are rules which determine their proper usage. Therefore, it must be possible to determine whether they are being used correctly through comparison to what is observable. However, if mental-state terms acquire their meaning through reference to private experiences within each of our minds, it is impossible to tell whether the words are being used correctly or not (as there is no public context by which to compare them). Talk of mind would become impossible. Therefore, when we talk of minds, we *must* be talking about what is publicly observable in order to avoid confusion and retain any meaning.

### Explain how Hempel’s hard behaviourism is influenced by the work of the Vienna Circle.

The Vienna Circle promoted *logical positivism*, a form of empiricism which proposes that a meaningful proposition must have empirical content and thus make positive claims about our experience. Hempel, therefore, adhered to the verificationist account of meaning. Since other minds cannot be observed, talk about them is either meaningless or reducible to what can be observed, which for Hempel means that meaningful talk about human minds require evidence that our claims about them can be reduced to behavioural descriptions.

### Use the examples of Dolores and Paul to illustrate Hempel’s hard behaviourism.

Suppose that Dolores has trodden on a nail, and is in significant pain, swearing, shouting, and attempting to remove the nail from her foot. Hempel says that this behaviour must constitute what it means to say that she is in pain, as the pain is not a private experience which causes Dolores’ behaviour, but just is the behaviour. 

Hempel gives his own example of ‘Paul has a toothache’. He proposes multiple test sentences which would provide the circumstances in which the statement would be verified, for example: ‘Paul weeps and makes gestures of such and such kinds’, ‘At the question ‘what is the matter?’ Paul responds ‘I have a toothache’, ‘closer examination reveals a decayed tooth’, etc etc.

All of these circumstances verify the statement that ‘Paul has a toothache’.
