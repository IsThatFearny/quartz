### What do eliminative materialists claim about mental states? (3)

Eliminative Materialism claims that developments in neuroscience will eventually show some, or even all our mental concepts are incorrect or mistaken, and that some/all mental properties do not and cannot exist.

### Outline Descartes’ conceivability argument for substance dualism. (5)

Descartes’ conceivability argument for Substance Dualism is as follows: we can conceive that, for any mental state, there is someone in the world who has that mental state without having the identical brain state. Because, what is conceivable is also metaphysically possible, it is metaphysically possible that a mental state can exist in the absence of its identical brain state. If something can exist when another thing is not present, then it follows that they are not the same thing. Therefore, because it is metaphysically possible that a mental state can exist in the absence of the ‘identical’ physical state, mental states cannot possibly be physical states.

### Explain how Block’s China thought experiment can be used to argue against functionalism. (5)

Block objects to functionalism, and proposes his ‘China’ thought experiment, which is as follows: imagine that your body’s nerves are connected to electronic transmitters, which are in turn connected to the entire population of China. Each Chinese person has a two way radio, some of which are connected to the input and output nerves of the body. For a moment, the Chinese population realises the very same machine table that can describe the functions of your mental states. If functionalism is correct, then this should be defined as a mind, but even if we believe that this ‘mind’ has intentional mental states (i.e. thoughts), it is difficult to accept the existence of a collective ‘Chinese consciousness’. Whilst this set-up duplicates function, it cannot duplicate the mind. This is because some of our mental states are qualia, and the system cannot possess qualia because they are not functional states.

### Outline mind-brain type identity theory and explain how the issue of multiple realisability challenges this view. (12)

Mind-brain type identity theory claims that there is one substance and that mental properties are, in fact, physical properties. Mental properties are entirely reducible to physical ones, and there is identity between the two. In other words, two distinct mental and physical concepts relate to the same property. The theory is particularly appealing because it follows Ockham’s razor: the simplest theory is the best. It is able to explain the mind without needing to reference anything that goes beyond physical properties.

In response to type-identity theory, the argument from multiple realisability can be proposed. This argues that it is entirely possible for two different species to have the same mental property, but have different physical properties, e.g. my physical reaction to pain might be very different to that of a hedgehog. This would seem to imply that mental properties cannot be identical to physical properties, because mental states can be realised in multiple different ways depending upon the circumstances.
