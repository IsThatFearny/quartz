# Analytic and Synthetic Propositions; Necessary and Contingent Truths

</br>

##### Analytic and Synthetic Propositions

An analytic proposition is that which involves a statement that is self-evidently true or false, i.e. true or false in terms of the meanings of the words involved, e.g. 1+1 = 2; the red house is red. These are opposed to synthetic propositions, which are true or false depending on the way that the world is, e.g.  the ripe tomato is red. Synthetic propositions can differ between possible worlds, whereas analytic propositions cannot. An analytic proposition, if true, is a necessary truth.


##### Necessary and Contingent Truths

A contingent truth is a truth which could be true depending on how the world is, e.g. ‘there are more insects than animals’ may be true now, but it hasn’t always been, and may not be in future; whereas a necessary truth is one that *must* be true, no matter the circumstances, e.g. mathematical propositions such as 1+1 = 2. 1+1 will always be equal to two, and there is no way to change this.
