# Indirect Realism Summary

</br>

Direct Realism states that we perceive exactly what is. However, this can be debunked through the arguments from perceptual variation, hallucination, illusion, and time-lag. In an attempt to work around these counter-examples, Indirect Realism arises.

Indirect Realism proposes that we experience everything through 'sense-data'. Sense-data is what we experience and perceive, but is separable from what actually is, as it can be both accurate and inaccurate. Indirect Realism uses this sense-data to propose that, hence the name, we perceive reality indirectly through sense-data.

Locke goes further and proposes that physical objects have primary and secondary qualities. A primary quality is a quality that an object has regardless of any changes that it may experience, and a secondary quality is a quality that something has that is subjective to the agent that is experiencing it, and depends upon the circumstances in which it is perceived. 

In this way, indirect realism counters the original counter-examples to direct realism.
