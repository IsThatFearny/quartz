# What is Mill's Qualitative Utilitarianism?

</br>

## a) Mill's defence and clarification of Utilitarianism
</br>

### How does Mill account for the lack of agreement on the criterion for right and wrong?
Mill says that, while it is often not recognised, the concept of Utility often significantly influences the formation of moral beliefs. This means that specific criterion for 'right' and 'wrong' may not be as important in utilitarianism as they may be in other normative ethical theories.
</br>

### How does Mill reply to the following objections/misunderstandings of Utilitarianism?

#### That Utilitarianism 'ignores the value of pleasure'?
A common misunderstanding is that 'Utility' means usefulness and not pleasure, and therefore Utilitarianism ignores the value of pleasure. Mill defends this by reasserting Bentham's claims: that 'actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness'; 'by happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain and the privation of pleasure'; and 'Pleasure, and freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as ends'

#### That Utilitarianism is redundant because 'we do not need happiness'?
Mill defends this objection by stating that this is irrelevant, as the sacrifice of happiness is virtuous when done for the happiness of others. The argument used in *Philosophy for AS and A Level, pp.210, Lacewing* is that 'Many wise and noble people have lived without [happiness]'. This is followed by an explanation of how said wise and noble people have sacrificed their happiness for others, and that the aim of Utilitarianism 'remains to increase the total happiness in the world'

#### That 'Utilitarians make right or wrong depend upon the agent's happiness'?
Mill defends this by saying that the criterion of right action is the happiness of everyone, and therefore we should organise society in a way that each person feels happy when making others happy

#### That Utilitarianism is a 'godless theory'?
Mill states that Utilitarianism is not a godless theory, as it can be made compatible with religious teachings (Mill mentions only Christianity due to his social context)

#### That Utilitarianism 'will lead to people sacrificing moral principles for 'expedient' moral action'

If an action is 'expedient' (in an individual's interest or in the short-term interest) then Utilitarianism condemns it, if it sacrifices the greater happiness for immediate or self gratification.

## b) Mill's Qualitative Utilitarianism

</br>

### How does Mill understand happiness (with specific reference to the happiness pleasure relation)?

Mill agrees with Bentham that happiness is 'pleasure and the absence of pain'. However, he defines happiness in a more complex way, stating that happiness is not 'a continuity of highly pleasurable excitement, but moments of such, in a existence made up of few and transitory pains, [and] many and various plesaures'

</br>

### Is such pleasure attainable?
Mill says that yes, when happiness is understood like his, it is certainly attainable. He argues that the main obstacles are a poor education and a poor social arrangement. He states that we can't always expect pleasure and happiness, but suffering is something that we can diminish over time

</br>

### Does Utilitarianism degrade humans in valuing only pleasure?

Mill claims that this argument misunderstands what humans take pleasure in. He says that there are 'higher' and 'lower' pleasures, higher pleasures being more 'valuable' than lower ones.

</br>

### Describe Mill's distinction between higher and lower pleasures
Mill distinguishes between higher and lower pleasure using quality instead of quantity (hence 'qualitative utilitarianism')


</br>

### Explain Mill's test for higher pleasures
Mill distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures by using a test. 'If everyone who has experience of two types of pleasures prefers one to the other, then the type that they prefer is more valuable' (*Lacewing, Philosophy for AS and A-Level, pp.213*). He also adds another condition to this: 'A pleasure is higher only if people who have experience of both types of pleasure prefer one even if having that pleasure brings more pain with it, or if they would choose it over a greater quantity of the other type of pleasure.' (*Lacewing, Philosophy for AS and A-Level, pp.213*)
</br>

### How are humans different to pigs, according to Mill?
Mill states that valuing only pleasure is 'a doctrine worthy only of a swine'. By this, he means that human beings are able to experience pleasure in a much more complex way than a pig is able to. Mill also states that 'it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied', adding that this statement derives from our sense of dignity, which is an integral part of our happiness
</br>

### How does Mill reply to the criticism that humans do not reliably purse higher over lower pleasures (with reference to how we distinguish between higher and lower)?

Mill argues that there is a difference between preference and action. We can still recognise that an alternative forgone may have been the more valuable action. Mill also argues that we may seek lower pleasures because they are more readily available to us, and seeking higher pleasures is more demanding and time-consuming. In addition, Mill says that pleasures may only be defined by the thoughts and opinions of those who are 'completely acquainted' with the pleasure being defined.
