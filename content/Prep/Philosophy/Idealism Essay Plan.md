# Idealism Essay Plan


### Outline

- Asserts that all perception and reality is composed of ideas
- These ideas are said to be in the mind of god (more on that later)
- Physical objects are ‘bundles’ or ‘collections’ of ideas
- A form of immaterialism
- All physical objects are constructs of the mind, and there is no external world
- All perception is either of primary or secondary qualities
</br>

### Logical Process

- All that we perceive are primary or secondary qualities
- Secondary qualities are mind-dependent (perceptual variation). The same argument applies to primary qualities
- Because all we perceive are primary or secondary qualities, and these are both mind-dependent, all that we perceive is mind-dependent
</br>

### Material Substratum

- Mind-independent objects require ‘material substratum’ in order to exist
- We have no conception of this independent of the object’s qualities
</br>

### Master argument

We cannot conceive of anything independently our minds. If we conceive of such a thing, the act of apprehending it in our minds renders it no longer mind-independent

</br>

### The cause of perception

- Physical objects are no ore than their qualities
- These are ideas, which are passive
- Perceptions therefore cannot be caused by ideas
- There must be another mind causing our perception
- Our perception is so complex and regular that this mind can only be god’s

</br>

### God’s perception

We perceive copies of ideas that exist in God’s mind, when God wishes

</br>

### Illusion and Hallucination

- Illusion: We make false inferences about our perception
- Hallucination: Ideas that are not coherently connected with our experience

</br>

### Objections

- No distinction between reality and hallucination
- Idealism can lead to solipsism (only my mind exists): We cannot perceive minds, and therefore we have no reason to believe that any other than mine exist. Berkeley’s response is that it is ‘possible’ that other minds exist, as we have a ‘notion’ of what a mind is, being one ourselves. He goes on to repeat the conclusion of the existence of god.

### Alternatives

- Main alternative is phenomenalism
- God conclusion rendered invalid, as states that to experience something, someone simply has to be in the ‘right place at the right time’ (continuing possibilities of experience)
- Scepticism is overcome - the phenomenalist would simply state that ‘if I stand here at the right time, I will see this’ - does not assert existence of physical objects
</br>

### Conclusion

Idealism is, to an extent, a satisfactory theory of perception. Majority holds up, although some objections are responded to poorly (e.g. ‘possibility of other minds’). However, phenomenalism expands upon Idealism further and overcomes difficulties faced, and this is therefore better.
