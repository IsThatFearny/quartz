# Innatism Exam Questions

</br>

## Briefly explain the difference between intuition and deduction

Deduction means that ‘if the premise is true, the conclusion *must* be true’. Intuition is the grasping of rational truth just by thinking about it. For example, in deductive reasoning, we can ‘see’ that the conclusion is true just because the premise is true. The difference is that intuition is not only used in deductive reasoning, and is part of forming analytic truths.

## Outline Plato’s argument for innate ideas.

To argue for innate ideas, Plato uses the example of Meno’s slave. In this story, Socrates asks the slave boy of Meno a series of questions on geometry and algebra. The boy answers these questions correctly, despite never having been educated on the subjects in question, or at all for that matter. Whilst this is a theoretical scenario, it is easy to see how this can be seen in the real world. Plato argues that we have innate knowledge that is unconscious, and can be unlocked through dialogue and questioning, or experience.

## Explain the empiricist claim that all concepts are ultimately derived from sense experience

The empiricist claims that we have no innate knowledge, and that all of the concepts that we know are derived solely from sense experience. Hume argues that we may not form an idea of a particular experience without having first experienced that thing, e.g. a blind man does not understand colour. He also argues that the building blocks of thought are simple ideas/concepts, which are one uniform property throughout, such as coldness or hardness. We cannot gain these simple ideas without sense experience, and so all concepts are derived from sense-experience as they are all composed of simple ideas.

## Explain Locke’s arguments against innate knowledge

John Locke makes a series of arguments asserting that we cannot have innate knowledge. Locke states that all innate knowledge must be universal, as it is knowledge imprinted upon our soul at birth. He then states that an idea must be conscious in the mind of the individual. Innate knowledge is therefore knowledge that every human is or has been conscious of. However, Locke argues that if this is true, how can we explain children and idiots’ lack of knowledge? Any claim not understood by these groups cannot be innate. No claims are universally accepted, and so Locke says that there is no innate knowledge. In addition to this, Locke also goes on to argue that extending the definition of innate knowledge to ‘truths we discover when we gain the use of reason’ can also be discounted, as children may reason before they can understand proposed ‘innate’ truths. Further, if we are to define innate knowledge as ‘truths that are agreed to immediately after they are understood’, then Locke counters this with the argument that many claims rely on sense experience, e.g. white is not black. Locke argues that there is no satisfactory definition of innate knowledge, and so it cannot exist.

Locke also argues that there are no innate concepts. He says that to have innate knowledge, one must be aware of the concepts which make up this knowledge. Knowledge cannot be innate if we first have to acquire the concepts that it is composed of. He goes on to propose three reasons for doubting the existence of innate knowledge. The first is that we have no reason to think that newborn babies have any concepts beyond that which they experienced in the womb. The second is the rejection of God as an innate concept, which is an argument favoured by innatists. It is very easily revealed that the concept of god is taught. The third argument is that knowledge is either remembered, or is new to the mind. Innate knowledge must be neither, and therefore cannot exist.
