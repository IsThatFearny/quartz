# What is Moral Philosophy?

</br>

## (a) Introductory Questions: Your Preconceptions

</br>

### (1) In three bullet points (or so), characterise your existing understanding of 'moral philosophy'

- Moral Philosophy is the study of ethics and the moral code that we as humans adhere to
- Moral philosophy deals with societal norms and standards, as well as inner human nature
- There are many ways to approach moral philosophy, and more are created as our society progresses and new ideas must be applied
</br>

### (2) You may believe that 'good' and 'right' name the same object, and you may indeed be right. But what do you think might be at issue in insisting on a distinction between 'goodness' on the one hand and 'rightness' on the other hand?

'Good' and 'right', whilst often thought of as one singular concept, are actually quite different. While something 'good' may be something that is beneficial to as many people as possible, something that is 'right' may only be right in certain circumstances, and may not benefit the majority. A useful example is secrets. Whilst people may benefit from you telling them a secret, and this could therefore be 'good', it is not the morally correct thing to do in the eyes of society and the people around you, and therefore would not be considered to be 'right'. However, this distinction can create issues, as often people attempt to justify their actions by saying that it was not necessarily 'good', but was the right thing to do. Both concepts are similar and linked together, and while a distinction is present between the two, this distinction cannot create a large disconnect between the two when it comes to ascribing judgements towards actions.

## (b) What is Moral Philosophy?

Questions relating to Michael Lacewing, _Philosophy for AS and A level_, pp. 200-01

### (3) Explain the claim that 'Perhaps uniquely amongst animals, we humans not only act, we also consider how we _should act_.'

Whilst all animals act in order to survive, including humans, we are perhaps unique, because we are held accountable to moral and ethical codes, ingrained into all of us by the people around us and by society. We know the difference between right and wrong, even if this difference may differ across cultures and societies. We can weigh up the benefits of an action, and decide whether we should do it, based upon the benefit that it would bring to the individual or to the group.
</br>

### (4) What is 'Normative Ethics'?

Normative ethics is an approach to moral philosophy that involves attempting to answer questions 'in general', 'developing and defending theories about what people care about or what makes their lives go well' (p.200, _Philosophy for AS and A level)._ Normative ethics gives us a general idea of what is right and wrong, good and bad.
</br>

### (6) What is 'practical' or 'applied ethics'?

Applied/Practical ethics involves trying to answer specific questions about how we should live, such as when it is right to go to war, or about how we should treat others. This type of ethics applies ideas to real life, and solves moral and ethical issues in specific scenarios.
</br>

### (7) What is 'metaethics'?

Metaethics is the study of what morality actually is. We query the very questions that we are asking, the very essence of moral philosophy, instead of attempting to solve actual issues in real life. Metaethics is questioning the framework behind moral philosophy.
