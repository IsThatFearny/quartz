### What is a philosophical zombie? (3)

A philosophical zombie is a human vessel with no conscious experience - i.e. it can move for itself and act like a real human being, but it has no mind or consciousness to support decision making or awareness.

### Explain the ‘inverted qualia’ objection to functionalism. (5)

The argument from inverted qualia is an objection to functionalism, which states that to have mental state $x$ is to have functional state $x$. The argument from inverted qualia proposes a thought experiment, which runs as follows: two people are looking at ripe tomatoes and fresh grass. They describe the tomatoes as red, and the grass as green, having been taught that these are the right words to describe these objects with. Both would say that the tomatoes are red and the grass is green, but the way a ripe tomato looks to the first person may be the way grass looks to the second. Functionally, they are identical, and yet experience different colours. ‘The way grass looks to you’ and ‘The way grass looks to me’ are caused by the same inputs, and cause the same outputs, but refer to different qualia. If this is possible, then functionalism is false, because it denies the possibility of inverted qualia.

### Explain why the asymmetry between self-knowledge and knowledge of other people’s mental states is problematic for philosophical behaviourism. (5)

We are directly aware of our own mental states through introspection and similar processes, but we can only know about the mental states of other people through observance of their behaviour. Our own mental states are unmistakeable, but we can make mistakes about the mental states of others. This is the asymmetry between self-knowledge and knowledge of other people’s mental states. This causes a problem for Behaviourism, because if mental states were dispositions to behaviour, then this would not be true. Saying ‘I am in pain’ would, under behaviourism, equate to me saying ‘My behaviour shows that I am in pain’. But surely we experience our own mental states directly? Philosophical behaviourism denies this asymmetry, and so its existence poses a problem for behaviourism.

### Explain the ‘knowledge/Mary’ argument (for property dualism) and the response that Mary gains acquaintance knowledge rather than propositional knowledge. (12)


The knowledge/Mary argument is an argument which denies physicalism, and in doing so supports property dualism. The thought experiment runs as follows:

Mary lives in a black-and-white room, with no access to other colours. She has lived in this room since birth, and has only ever seen black and white. She has, however, learnt everything there is to know about human sight - about corneas, cones, colours, etc. - all without ever experiencing a colour. One day, Mary is released from this black-and-white existence into the real world, and she sees an apple hanging from a tree. She therefore experiences ‘red’. She has learnt new facts about seeing colours, and therefore it can be concluded that not all facts are physical, which debases physicalism entirely.

An objection to this argument is that Mary does not gain new propositional knowledge from the experience of seeing the red apple, but instead gains acquaintance knowledge. She has never experienced the phenomenal properties associated with red, and is effectively ‘meeting’ red for the first time. She already has all of the propositional knowledge about red from her studies, and so learns nothing new in terms of propositional knowledge, but does gain new acquaintance knowledge through her experience of the phenomenal properties associated with ‘red’.
