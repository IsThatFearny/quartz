# What is Virtue Epistemology?

</br>

### How does the third condition of the virtue epistemologist definition of knowledge differ from the reliabilist approach?

'Intellectual virtues' and a 'reliable cognitive process' are distinct concepts, as intellectual virtues focus on person and what they do in forming their beliefs, whereas a reliable cognitive process is the same for all people.
</br>

### What, according to Zagzebski, does it mean 'to know that P'?

Zagzebski states that that you know P if and only if:
- You believe that P
- Your belief that P arises from an act of intellectual virtue

</br>

### What is a virtue? Include Zagzebski's two components in your answer

A virtue is 'a state of person that is good by way of helping the person achieve some good purpose or goal' (*Lacewing, Philosophy for AS and A-Level, pp. 59*). Zagzebski says that a virtue has two components:
- A virtue motivates us to do what is good, e.g. discover the truth
- A virtue gives us the ability to be reliable in forming true beliefs

### How does virtue epistemology deal with: a) Gettier  counterexamples, b) Fake Barn County?

#### Gettier Counterexamples
Take for example the Smith and Jones Gettier case. Virtue epistemology deals with this by stating that Smith's belief would not count as knowledge in the first place, as it was not a result of any intellectual virtue, and was merely a coincidence.

##### Revised
Smith's belief does not count as knowledge because it was not formed by intellectual virtues. Gettier cases arise when beliefs are formed by chance/luck, not through use of intellectual virtues

</br>

#### Fake Barn County
In the case of Fake Barn County, Sosa proposes a type of knowledge called 'animal knowledge', knowledge which can also be possessed by non-humans. Apt belief is equated to animal knowledge. It is contrasted with the usual definition of knowledge (here called reflective knowledge) by the statement that human knowledge requires the ability to reflect on your belief. In the case of Fake Barn County, the person has 'animal knowledge' but not 'reflective knowledge' as they do not have the context required, which is in this case, the knowledge that they are in Fake Barn County

##### Revised
Henry's belief is only animal knowledge because the context means he cannot properly reflect on his true belief
</br>

### What issue might we raise with Sosa's account?

Critics say that Sosa has moved the goalposts in terms of defining knowledge. They say that Sosa seems to be exploring under what conditions a person can assert that they have knowledge, instead of asking under what conditions a person can know x or y. These are entirely separate endeavours, and it is possible that Sosa is committing the fallacy of equivocation in this case.

##### Revised
We can argue that Sosa has moved the goalposts - they have changed the debate from what it means to know to under what conditions someone can be said to form knowledge. He is focussing on the conditions of the knower, rather than knowledge itself
</br>

### Consider the assessment of Zagzebski's approach. How successfully do you think she has defined knowledge?

Zagzebski's approach avoids the gap between truth and the third condition, and therefore prevents gettier cases. However, in the case of Fake Barn County, this analysis is far too vague, as we need a deeper understanding of what is required for a belief to be true because it arises from an act of intellectual virtue. 

Another issue is how broad 'virtue' should be. For example, it is possible that the definition of virtue could restrict knowledge to only adult humans. Zagzebski herself says that, with a broad definition of 'virtue' this can be extended to unconscious, reflexive and automatic actions, allowing young children to have knowledge as soon as they can differentiate between truth and falsehood and are motivated to find the truth.

A third issue is the place of virtue within knowledge. For example, if a person is generally too lazy to perform an act of intellectual virtue, but in one certain case they do, this is out of character for them. Surely then, this would be an 'accident' of sorts, and therefore cannot be considered to be knowledge. Should we grant knowledge to only those who have intellectual virtues
In addition, motive is brought into question. Animals for example often acquire knowledge with very little motive. As long as the process is reliable, surely motive is irrelevant. This brings the necessity of virtues over reliable processes into doubt.

Zagzebski's account of knowledge is relatively well formed, and does not fall into some common pitfalls, however there are more complex issues that are raised with it. The account is decently successful, but cannot be said to have found a successful definition for knowledge.
