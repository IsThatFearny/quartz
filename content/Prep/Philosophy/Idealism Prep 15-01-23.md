## Explain Berkely's argument that everything we perceive is mind-dependent

Berkely argues that both primary and secondary qualities (which, he says, make up everything that we perceive) are both mind-dependent, and therefore it follows that everything we perceive must be mind-dependent. To argue his point about secondary qualities being mind-dependent, he uses the argument from perceptual variation, stating that if a secondary quality may be different for each person, then it cannot be mind-independent, as that would mean that it would look the same for each person that perceived it. He then goes on to argue that primary qualities are also mind-dependent, using the argument that what may look small to a human looks huge to a mouse, or that something that may look smooth might actually be jagged. These examples show that we cannot say which properties an object has. Berkely says that this is evidence that both primary and secondary qualities are mind-dependent. He then clarifies that we perceive nothing more or less than primary and secondary qualities, and therefore all objects of our perception are mind-dependent.

## Outline Berkely's argument from experience to Idealism

In Berkely's first dialogue, Hylas proposes that all objects must have a 'material substratum' and that this may exist unperceived. However, Berkely, through Philonous, argues that to exist unperceived is not possible, as an object is merely a composition of properties. You cannot imagine a table without shape or solidity, as these properties are what makes a table a table. Berkely also argues that our experience cannot verify the existence of a mind-independent external world, and that the hypothesis of physical substance is not even suggested by experience. If we therefore adhere to our experience, this supports the claim that all there is is wat we can experience. We experience ideas, and therefore experience does not support realism, but idealism instead.

## Compare and contrast Berkely's three arguments. Which do you think is the strongest and why?

I believe that Berkely's argument that Berkely's second argument on perceiving physical objects is the strongest, as it effectively disproves realism. The conclusion and the propositions that lead to said conclusion are sound and logical, and the empirical nature of our experience is good evidence and sound reasoning for the hypothesis of Idealism.

## Outline Berkely's 'Master' argument

Berkely's puts great emphasis on this argument, in which he states that it is impossible to think of an object that is neither perceived nor conceived of, as we can only think of the idea of said object. The thought of the object is subjective to the mind of the thinker, and therefore is mind-dependent.
