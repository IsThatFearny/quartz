# Behaviourism Summary

</br>

## Hard Behaviourism

Hempel argues that the verification principle can be applied to the question of what psychological language means. This is called **[[Philosophy/Glossary#Hard Behaviourism|Hard Behaviourism]]**.

### Scientific statements

Hempel’s starting point is asking what the meaning of a scientific statement is. He claims that to know the meaning of a statement, we must know the conditions under which it would be true or false, i.e. the meaning of a statement is established by the conditions of its verifications. This allows us to draw multiple conclusions: **firstly**, if we cannot say what the conditions of verification for a statement are, then that statement is meaningless. This is the [[Philosophy/Glossary#verification principle|verification principle]]; **secondly**, two statements have the same meaning if they are both true or false in the same conditions. For example, the statements ‘the temperature in the room is 21°C’ and ‘the level of mercury in the thermometer is at the mark ‘21’ on the Celsius scale’ are alike. The former statement is an abbreviation of the latter (this being a condition for verification); and **third**, we can translate a statement with the concept ‘temperature’ into a series of statements that describe the conditions of verification.

### Psychological Statements

Hempel says that we can apply these results to psychological statements:

1) Unless we can say how to check whether a statement like ‘Paul has a toothache’ is true or false, then it will be meaningless.
2) This statement’s meaning is given by its conditions of verification, e.g. ‘Paul weeps and makes gestures towards his mouth’, or ‘Paul says ‘I have a toothache’ when asked what the matter is’
3) The statement *means* these claims, and can be translated without loss of meaning into these exact claims. To talk about Paul’s mental states is to talk about his behavioural and physical states.
4) These claims only use physical concepts, i.e. concepts concerning physical behaviour and processes.

> [!tldr] TLDR - Hempel's Hard Behaviourism
> 
> Hempel advocates for applying the verification principle to understand the meaning of psychological language. This is known as Hard Behaviourism. He says that the meaning of a statement is determined by the conditions of its verification. If we cannot specify these conditions, the statement is deemed meaningless. Hempel extends this idea to psychological statements, asserting that the meaning of such statements lies in their verifiable conditions, whgich can be translated into observable behaviors. In essence, discussing mental states is equivalent to discussing behavioral and physical states, exclusively using physical concepts.

## Soft Behaviourism

Ryle argues along similar lines to Hempel, but his ‘**[[Philosophy/Glossary#soft behaviourism|soft behaviourism]]**’ has a number of differences:

> [!note] Differences
> 
> 1) Ryle does not make his argument by appealing to the verification principle, rather he presents arguments specifically concerned with mental concepts
> 
> 2) He does not claim that psychological statements can be translated or reduced without loss of meaning into behavioural descriptions
> 
> 3) His understanding of 'behaviour' is different to Hempel's - he says that the language we use to describe behaviour is our ordinary language
> 
> 4) He places explicit emphasis on the idea of *dispositions* to behave


</br>

### Dispositions

Hempel’s theory is somewhat flawed: all statements about verification conditions must describe actual behaviour. This is implausible, because 1) we can control our behaviour; 2) many mental states are dispositions rather than occurrences. Therefore, in order to make sense of behaviourism, we must understand it in terms of *dispositions*, i.e. behaviour that someone would display under different conditions. Ryle argues that talk of mental states is not only talk of actual behaviour, but also of dispositions to behave in certain ways. We can express dispositions using ‘if this, then that’ statements.

> [!note] On other minds
> 
> We do not infer that other people who display certain behaviours have a mind. The link between behaviour and minds isn't based on evidence, but is instead logical/conceptual. To understand what others say and do is to understand that they have minds. Philosophical behaviourism therefore solves the problem of other minds

</br>

### Issues

#### Dualist arguments

Philosophical behaviourism is required respond to Descartes **Indivisibility argument** and his **Conceivability argument**:

> [!note] A reminder of the Indivisbility and Conceivability arguments
> 
> **Indivisibility:** The mind cannot be the body because the mind is not spatially divisible, yet the body is.
> 
> **Conceivability:** We can conceive of the mind and the body existing as separate and distinct substances

Philosophical behaviourism responds to the **indivisibility argument** by claiming that ‘the mind’ is not spatially divisible because it is not a thing at all. To talk in this way is a category mistake.

It responds to the **conceivability argument** by arguing that beliefs such as belief in God and the soul in the afterlife don’t actually reflect how we use our concepts in everyday life. The belief in mind without body is not in everyday use, and therefore we cannot have a clear and distinct idea of ourselves as ‘minds’ only. We are mistaken if we think that we can.

</br>

### Multiple Realisability

There is an argument to say that the same mental state in different people or even different species can involve different behavioural states: I might not react to pain in the same way as others.

Hempel replies that whilst overt behaviour varies, physiology and brain processes will not. Ryle replies that the objection misunderstands behaviourism, because when we analyse the whole pattern of behaviour we will see that the same mental state involves similar dispositions in different people.

</br>

### Circularity

This argument claims that we cannot eliminate references to mental states when attempting the define them in terms of behaviour.

In response to this, Hempel completely abandons the claim that we can reduce statements about mental states to statements about behaviour. Ryle replies that his theories do not define mental states in this way: mental states cannot be eliminated because they work at a higher level of generality.

### Asymmetry between self-knowledge and knowledge of other people’s minds

We are directly aware of our own mental states through introspection and similar processes, but we can only know about the mental states of other people through observance of their behaviour. Our own mental states are unmistakeable, but we can make mistakes about the mental states of others. This is the asymmetry between self-knowledge and knowledge of other people’s mental states. This causes a problem for Behaviourism, because if mental states were dispositions to behaviour, then this would not be true. Saying ‘I am in pain’ would, under behaviourism, equate to me saying ‘My behaviour shows that I am in pain’. But surely we experience our own mental states directly? Philosophical behaviourism denies this asymmetry.

Ryle defends his theory by arguing that ‘consciousness’ and ‘introspection’ are a matter of paying attention to ourselves, especially our internalised speech. We learn about our mental states and those of other people in the same way.

The response to this is that mental states have an ‘inner’, qualitative aspect, such as how they feel, their phenomenal properties. Perhaps all mental states are distinct from behaviour, but certainly at least this aspect of consciousness cannot be completely analysed in terms of behavioural dispositions.
