### Economic

- Veshenka (supervised economic development) established December 1917
- Petrograd citizens living on 50g of bread per day
- Grain crisis Spring 1918
- Food supplies policy established May 1918
- State capitalism as an economic system - some degree of state control but private markets still involved… NEP comparison
- Industrialisation failed under control of workers: they gave themselves exorbitant pay rises and were not skilled enough to manage or use equipment
- Railways, banks, merchant fleets, power companies, and Putilov iron works were nationalised. Sugar was the first industry to be fully nationalised in May 1918. November 1920 nearly all factories/businesses nationalised
- War communism resulted in output falling to 20% of pre-war levels in 1921
- Harvest of 1921 produced only 48% of that of 1913
- Scissors crisis in 1923 - agricultural prices remained low, while industrial prices skyrocketed
- By 1926, 1913 production levels had been reached again.

### Social

- High inflation caused peasants to hoard produce - workers in the cities were supplied little food and lived on 50g of bread in February 1918
- Kulaks labelled ‘enemies of the people’
- 3 million dead in Typhus epidemic in 1920
- Population of Petrograd in 1920 was 57.5% lower than 1917
- Population of Russia decreased by 40 million
- 100,000 red army troops deployed to stop Tambov revolts in 1920
- 30,000 Kronstadt sailors revolted - most loyal supporters of the revolution. 15,000 taken prisoner

- First five year (28-32) plan aimed to: increase production by 300%; develop heavy industry'; boost electricity output by 600%; Double light industry output
- As a result, electricity output trebled, coal and iron output doubled, steel production increased by ⅓
- Second five year plan (33-37) aimed to continue heavy industry development, place new emphasis on light industry, develop communications, and boost engineering
- As a result: Moscow metro opened 1935, volga canal in 1937, Dnieprostroi Damn extended (largest dam in europe). Steel output trebled, coal production doubled

- Private agricultural market accounted for 52% of veggies, 70% of meat and 71% of Milk 

### Social

- Collectivisation began with 25% of grain-farming areas as a target in Jan 1930. By March, 58% of households had been collectivised (using force and propaganda).
