# Revolutionary Russia Figes Comprehension
</br>

### Create a timeline of Stalin’s economic policies
1922: Trade resumes quickly, food abundant

1923: Cereal production had increased by 23% compared with 1920. Prices fell. Industrial goods remained expensive.

April 1923: Industrial good prices lowered. Industry grew. NEPmen sold grain, meat, eggs, etc. making a large profit. Corruption became commonplace. Feeling that the NEP was betraying the revolution

1926-27: Exports at 33% and imports 38% of 1913 levels. Grain 3 million tons compared to 12 million tons in 1913.

1926: Unemployment at 4%

1927-28: Grain crisis, state procured grain dropped by 25%

1928-32: First Five Year Plan - Industrial production was to triple, coal and steek production to double, and pig-iron production to quadruple.

1933-37: Second Five Year Plan - Prioritised heavy industry to become one of the main steel producers in the world

### Summarise Stalin’s economic policies in 5 key features

- Collectivisation: The creation of collective farms
- Prioritisation of industry: Raw material production was prioritised in the Five Year Plans
- Grain requisition: Part of war communism; the Cheka forcibly took grain produced to a quota by peasants
- Electrification of the country
- Quota: All workers were made to follow strict quotas of production
</br>

### Summarise Stalin’s economic model in 5 key features

- De-kulakisation: The removal of the Kulak class through purges
- NEP: Elements of capitalism combined with Socialism
- Central planning: All orders came from Stalin and his government, with little to no devolution to local government
- Terror: Grain and crops would be harvested by force if necessary, specifically through the Cheka
- Propaganda: Stalin used propaganda in order to indoctrinate the population into believing that the Five year Plan followed Marxist ideology and the ideology of the revolution
</br>

### What were Stalin’s motivations behind the ‘Great Turn’?

Stalin wanted to increase the speed of industrialisation and to become a major player in world trade by increasing supplies of pig-iron, steel, coal, and the like.
</br>

### How did Stalin motivate the people to support his five year plans?

Stalin promised that the Five year Plan would create a ‘society of universal abundance for the proletariat’. He used propaganda to persuade people that their hard work would pay off in future, when they would be rewarded with the fruits of their labour.

</br>

### What were the motivations behind collectivisation?

Stalin’s motivation lay in a general mistrust of the peasantry and political gain. Stalin wanted to destroy the Kulak class, and the independence of the peasantry, in order to prevent them from holding the state to ransom.

</br>

### What impact did terror have in ‘collectivisation’?

Intimidation tactics such as using troops at town votes on collectivisation, the threatening of those who spoke out against collectivisation, and the expulsion of those who took their criticism too far, all prevented peasants from stepping out of line, and forced them to submit to collectivisation for fear of repercussion.

</br>

### How important was ideology to Stalin’s agrarian policies?

Those who enforced Stalin’s policies believed fervently in communism, and believed that their actions were helping to ‘advance to a communist society’, and that ‘any sacrifice was justified to reach that end’. Without this enforcement by enthusiastic party members, Stalin’s agrarian policies would have been difficult to implement.

</br>

### What impact did Stalin’s policy of collectivisation have on Russia?

It was disastrous for the economy. The collective farms did not have a supply of able workers due to de-kulakisation, and they were considered by many serfs as a ‘second serfdom.’ Tractors were in short supply, and were substituted for by human labour. They were poorly managed, and were under pressure to minimize costs. This meant that living conditions were poor, and production low, negatively impacting Russia’s food supply and causing famine.

</br>
### What did ‘storming’ production mean and what impact did it have on industry?

Storming production involved forcing workers to work 24/7, paying workers rates dependent on their output, and organising ‘shock brigades’ using the hardest workers on the highest rates of pay. This drove competition between factories and industries to produce more, including league tables, medals and rewards for high productivity, This gave industry a major boost, but also gave rise to a culture of accusations and unrealistic expectations.

</br>

### How did Stalin use ‘nationalism’ to fuel industrial growth?

Stalin invoked nationalism to defend the revolution and to promote industrial growth by bringing up Russia’s suffering at the hands of other nations, such as the Turkish, the French, the Polish, and many other countries. He argued that this occurred because Russia was ‘backward’, and therefore Russia ‘must no longer lag behind’. This argument for increasing industrial production, for fear of international pressure, helped to fuel industrial growth, as the workers had a sense of patriotism and nationalism instilled in them.
</br>

### What other measures did Stalin use to bring about industrialisation?

Stalin used forced labour in remote regions of Russia in order to promote industrialisation. No one would go of their own free will to Russia’s abundant areas because they were cold and far away, and so Stalin forced those arrested in de-kulakisation and those accused of being ‘enemies’ to work in these areas.

</br>

### What were the ‘gulags’ and how were they used to support economic growth?

The Gulags were the ‘Main Administration of Corrective Labour Camps and Colonies’. this was a form of Soviet prison, beginning as a way to isolate political prisoners, but turning into labour colonies, a cheap and effective way of exploiting natural resources of the remote areas of Russia. This created a slave economy, building infrastructure and exploiting resources to greater effect, 

</br>

### How important was ideology to Stalin’s economic policies?

Ideology justified Stalin’s policies of collectivisation, de-kulakisation, grain requisition, and the use of terror. He was able to argue that Kulaks were undermining the revolution, that collective farms were a form of communism, as was grain requisition. Ideology played a major part in making the masses play along with his policies,

</br>

### How important was terror to Stalin’s economic policies?

Without terror, Stalin’s economic policies would not have been achieved. The political police were a ‘driving [force] of industrialisation’, controlling labour camps across the country and providing raw materials for industrial production,. The White Sea Canal is a prime example of this.
