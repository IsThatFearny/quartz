**Post war government**

- Wartime institutions dismantled -  GKO (defence committee) dissolved on  September 1945
- Military hierarchy downgraded - Zhukov demoted to a military command post in Odessa, (losing his position on the central committee) and Stalin took the role of Minister of defence
- Major figures played off against one another - Zhdanov challenged Malenkov’s policy of moving industry eastwards, and Malenkov’s actions were condemned, causing him to lose his position as Party Secretary, being replaced by Zhdanov
- This was reversed after a foreign policy disagreement, after which Zhdanov and his supporters were demoted, and Malenkov reinstated
- Stalin largely relied on his private secretariat bypass the government and the party
- **No** party congresses were held between 1939 and 1952, and only **six** meetings of the central committee were held during this time
- Politburo reduced to an **advisory body**
- Party recruitment fell back from wartime, but remained strong: By **1952**, the party had almost **7 million** members and the Komsomol had approx. **16 million**

**Culture**

- Zhdanovschina (cultural purge) launched in 1946
- Socialist realism became the norm again - Shostakovich accused of ‘rootless cosmopolitanism’; Eisenstein criticised for portraying Tsarist bodyguards as ‘thugs’; Dostoevsky’s works removed from sale for his heroes lacking socialist qualities
- Study of Maths, Physics, and Chemistry was governed by Marxist principles
- Zhdanov’s views on Economics were published in 1952 - no-one dared challenge them for fear of retribution
- Western influence was entirely blocked - non-communist foreign newspapers were unobtainable, foreign radio transmissions were blocked, and very little western literature was allowed in

**Revival of Terror**

- Very little evidence was needed to condemn an individual for espionage or political opposition
- Beria was responsible for a vast expansion of the gulag system
- The NKVD was strengthened and reorganised - it was split into two bodies, the MVD (Internal Affairs) and the MGB (State Security)
- The terror was lesser than in the 1930s, but tens of thousands were still arrested annually
- Approx. 12 million wartime survivors were sent to the gulags
- The Leningrad Case, 1949 - Stalin purged the Leningrad Party (who had become relatively independent), and arrested high ranking officials, including Voznesenky, who was Head of Gosplan
- Anti-Semitism - Stalin was worried about Israel’s support for the US, and so stepped up anti-semitism. The director of the Jewish theatre in Moscow was killed in a mysterious car accident in 1948, and the Jewish wives of Molotv and Kalinin were arrested in 1949
- Mingrelian case, 1951-52 - Purge in Georgia in 1951 directed against Beria’s followers to weaken his authority (although with some racist overtones)
- Doctors Plot, 1952 - The accusation of nine doctors (in 1948) of failing to treat Zhdanov professionally caused their arrest in 1952. Stalin spread rumours that Jews were using their positions to harm the USSR. Hundreds of doctors were arrested and tortured, and anti-jewish hysteria was whipped up by the press. Stalin died before the end of this
