#### Alexander II deserves the title of “Tsar Liberator.” Assess the validity of this view.

Alexander II’s reforms during his reign have earned him recognition among many historians as ‘Tsar Liberator’. However, some argue that he is not deserving of this title. This essay will analyse the Tsar’s liberation of the serfs, his expansion of civil rights and his liberalisation of political institutions, and his policy of russification in order to conclude whether Alexander II is deserving of this title.

The liberation of the serfs caused the Tsar to be seen as a ‘liberator’. The emancipation edict of 1861 freed all privately owned serfs (state serfs were freed in 1867). This meant that peasants were now, in theory, free to leave the commune, trade freely, move to cities, and so on. They were also meant to have greater political freedom and greater economic power. Alexander II saw this as the only way to advance Russia’s economy and prevent their ongoing loss of status on the world stage. This is one of the main reasons that Alexander has been given the title of liberator, because the emancipation of the serfs brought to an end an oppressive regime that prevented the majority of the population from bettering themselves, and ‘freed’ them from their masters. 80% of the population were peasants, and almost all of these lived under serfdom, and so the emancipation edict was a huge step in civil rights for the peasantry. However, whilst this is certainly a major reason why the Tsar is considered to be a ‘liberator’, the judgement of historians may be erroneous. Whilst Alexander certainly emancipated the serfs, and freed them in theory, in practise the effect was much less profound. Serfs had to pay ‘redemption payments’ for 49 years, in order to compensate their former masters for loss of labour. Additionally, they had to obtain a passport to leave the commune, and their lives were still mostly dictated by the mir. Some did move to urban areas to contribute to the growing industrialisation of Russia, but most were forced to remain in the villages that they already lived in. This prevented the growth of Russian industry, and constrained the majority of the population to agriculture and cottage industry. This meant that, despite emancipation, peasants had it little better than before. Despite their liberation, they were not truly free, and in some cases peasants were actually worse off than before the emancipation edict. Additionally, the actions of the Tsar were not solely motivated by a desire to help his subjects, but were instead a result of a desire for economic progress. Freeing the serfs was the only way that he could do this, and so his motive for emancipation was corrupted. This means that the term ‘Tsar liberator’ is perhaps not fitting, as this portrays him as a ruler who wanted to help his population, instead of someone driven solely by a desire for prosperity. Thus a common misconception is shown to be false: the Tsar does not deserve the title of ‘Tsar Liberator’ for his role in emancipating the serfs, as his efforts did not go far enough to truly free the peasantry, and his actions were driven by necessity, instead of altruism.

The title of ‘liberator’ also arose from Alexander II’s expansion of civil rights and political institutions. He delegated more power to the zemstva, giving the people more power to govern themselves, and allowed the establishment of volost courts, in which trials were carried out by juries of the defendant’s peers, creating a much fairer political and judiciary system. This was liberation of sorts, as the peasantry and the lower classes now had the power to make decisions for themselves, in theory, and so they were liberated from the state government to a greater extent than previously. Additionally, Alexander II relaxed censorship significantly during the first half of his reign - 10,000 books were published in the year after the censorship laws were relaxed, a massive increase from the 2,000 that had been published the year before. This meant that the people were now free to spread their own ideas and ideologies without fear of repercussions, which gave rise to wider variety of thought, again liberating them. However, as in the case of emancipation, Alexander’s reforms were not particularly effective. The zemstva and volost courts were dominated by nobles, which meant that decisions were made based upon their needs, which were often in direct opposition to the needs of the majority, and so little changed in this aspect. Additionally, while the censorship laws were loosened in the first part of Alexander’s reign, in the latter stages they were tightened again in order to suppress disorder and expressions of discontent with the regime. This meant that the period in which the people were ‘liberated’ from controlled ideology was relatively short, and so we cannot say that they were truly liberated by the Tsar. Due to this, the Tsar’s attempts at liberation failed in practise, and so he becomes ever less deserving of the title of ‘Tsar liberator’.

## Plans

#### The reforms of Alexander II transformed Russian society between 1855 and 1881. Assess the validity of this view.

- LOE 1: Emancipation
	- 1861 Edict freed private serfs
	- In theory would liberate the peasantry and stimulate industry
	- Peasants could technically leave the commune and advance beyond cottage industry
	- Some peasants, known as Kulaks, became prosperous
	- Majority of peasants remained tied to the mir through redemption payments, for 49 years
	- A small minority moved to urban areas
	- Subsistence farming continued, and traditional farming methods prevailed - strip farming persisted on 90% of land by 1881
	- Peasants were unable to financially support themselves and so remained in the communities that they lived in
	- State serfs not freed until 1867
	- Whilst for some things did change, emancipation was hardly transformative

- LOE 2: Political and Judicial
	- Zemstva given more power over their local community - could control taxation
	- Judicial system overhauled, fairer trials by a jury of the defendant’s peers. Judges came from the community
	- Elections made fairer and more representative - people had more say in the politics of their area
	- Zemstva remained dominated by nobles, so political decisions were made in their favour
	- Courts biased against peasants and controlled by the nobility
	- Nobles maintained power and control over the peasantry, and so the old ways remained intact

- LOE 3: Other reforms
	- Conscription reduced from 25 years to 15 (with 10 years in reserve)
	- Censorship relaxed significantly - large increase in books published
	- Education made accessible to all, and extended further for a wider age range. Literacy rate increased as a result
	- These reforms went some way to transforming society, and in the short term did so

- Conclusion
	- The reforms of Alexander II did not ‘transform’ Russian society.
	- Changes were made, but the effect was minimal
	- Society remained much the same as before Alexander II’s reign

#### The political authority of the tsarist regime had been weakened by the reforms of Alexander II but was restored by his son, Alexander III. Assess the validity of this view.

- LOE 1: Reforms of Alexander II
	- Emancipation - liberation of the serfs weakened political authority, as peasants were now, to an extent, able to rebel against the regime
	- Education - More education and an increase in literacy rates allowed for the spreading of anti-autocratic ideology
	- Censorship - the relaxation of censorship allowed people to spread their ideas more freely
	- Political - the zemstva was given devolved power over taxes and what to sped said taxes on. The bodies attracted professionals such as doctors and lawyers, and so they became hubs of political debate, much to the dismay of the regime
	- Judiciary - Volost courts were established, which reduced the power that the state government had over local trials
	- All of these factors show that the political authority of the tsarist regime was weakened significantly by Alexander II’s reforms, and that it was easier to spread anti-autocratic sentiment amongst a wider audience

- LOE 2: Reaction of Alexander III
	- Russification - in order to suppress discontent, Alexander III pursued a doctrine of Russification, in which he enforced Russian language and cultural/societal norms upon ethnic minorities in national areas such as Finland, Poland, etc. This reduced opposition and increased the political authority of the regime in these areas
	- Censorship - Censorship was tightened, decreasing the legal transmission of political ideas
	- Education - decreased education and a new curriculum that taught loyalty to the Tsar. Prevented political ideologies spreading
	- Manifesto of unshakeable autocracy - a statement declaring Alexander III’s intentions, emphasising his divine right to rule and the public faith in autocratic power
	- Increased church powers - the church could control many aspects of Russian society and worked closely with the Tsar in order to maintain order
	- Reduced zemstva powers
	- Reduced volost court powers
	- These reactions had the effect of centralising power in the state government and in the throne, thus restoring political authority

- LOE 3: Opposition
	- Political authority had been weakened because opposition had been allowed to spread
	- Censorship relaxation increased it, and so Alexander III tightened censorship laws
	- Marxist thought groups were suppressed and sent to siberia in state controlled court cases
	- All threats to autocracy were exiled

- Conclusion
	- Alexander III restored political authority to the Tsarist regime
	- He ruled with an iron fist, and so made people loyal using terror tactics
	- This view is a valid one
