## The main reason for Major's surprise election victory in 1992 was the failure of the Labour Party election campaign. ATVOTV.

One can argue that Kinnock should have won the 1992 election quite comfortably and therefore it would be easy to conclude that his campaign was the key factor, having had a consistent lead of over 5% in the polls for the previous 12 months. Certainly, both Labour's errors on tax increases and Kinnock's disastrous Sheffield rally could be pinpointed. However, the stronger argument is that Labour had not gone far enough in shaking off its 'Old Labour' associations and that voters still trusted the Tories more on the economy. In this essay it will be argued that it was the leadership factor - with Major trumping Kinnock as a plausible Prime Minister - that proved decisive. I shall analyse Kinnock’s campaign failures, Labour’s association with ‘Old Labour’, and the preference for Major as the stronger leadership candidate.

The failings of the Labour Party campaign can be seen as important in such a close election. Two significant mistakes appeared to undermine Labour's six-point lead going into campaign: first, Shadow-Chancellor John Smith's announcement that voters would be prepared to accept tax increases in order to fund an improved NHS, which raised the spectre of the Old Labour of the seventies and tax and spend; it was argued at the time that just because the voters said that they would be happy to take on extra tax burden, this does not mean that they were being entirely honest, and so an increase in tax was an unpopular policy, leading voters away from the Labour party; second, Kinnock's disastrous Sheffield Rally performance a week before the election suggested that the Labour leader was taking the electorate for granted in anticipating victory. With a six-point lead at the start of the campaign, the gap narrowed in the last two weeks of the campaign, suggesting that Labour campaign mistakes were significant, contributing to a narrow Tory victory with an overall majority of just 21. The Sheffield rally demonstrated to the electorate that Labour were over-confident and arrogant, and the presidential style in which Kinnock campaigned led voters away from the Labour party due to a dislike of this arrogance.

However, one could also assert that Kinnock's failure to shake off 'Old Labour' associations were more deep-rooted and left Labour vulnerable during the campaign. Whilst Kinnock had defeated the militant tendency in 1985 and unilateralists in 1989, successfully redefining the party as a pro-European, social democratic party, he was unable to shake off his own associations with 'Old Labour' as the formerly out-spoken, left-wing son of a Welsh miner. It is highly significant that Conservative references to the Winter of Discontent appeared to strike a chord with voters when Major had, in 1991, presided over the worst recession since 1945. Middle-England, swing voters in key marginals still trusted the Tories more with the economy. This provides the context for Smith's mistake in raising the spectre of 'Tax and Spend during the campaign. It would serve to prove to the electorate that Labour were not a ‘safe pair of hands’ for the economy, and the Tory legacy of handling the economy well (even when they didn’t) still hung over the electorate. Thus, whilst Labour's poll leads closed during the first two weeks of the campaign, Major remained 10 points ahead of Kinnock in the approval ratings.

Thus, one also has to consider Major's strengths in assessing his surprise election triumph in 1992. Major had appeared to face an almost impossible task in succeeding Thatcher in November 1990. Not only was inflation at 11% and the economy entering a deep recession, but the divisive issue of Europe was bound to dominate election year with the major summit at Maastricht determining the future course of the EEC. In this context, Major's calm leadership, bringing inflation down to under 4% by the time of the election, and achieving his three key opt-outs from the Maastricht Treaty [on federalism; the social charter and the single currency] could be seen as decisive in the election victory. Furthermore, Major established a reputation for consensus which set him apart from his predecessor and allowed the Tories to challenge for the centre-ground where the Lib-Dem protest vote had previously posed a great threat. Consequently; the Lib-Dems fell back, winning two fewer seats compared to 1987 and the Conservatives were able to maintain a small overall majority.

Finally, it could be argued that it was very closeness of the election that played into Major's hands as the campaign heated up with two weeks to go. At the start of April, polls suggested that a hung parliament was the most likely result, and the Conservatives were able to use their support in the Murdoch press to highlight the possibility of a Labour coalition with the Lib-Dems and the sort of deal that might be struck. Kinnock later blamed the Murdoch press, and particularly The Sun for scaremongering and persuading voters that a hung parliament would see a coalition and constitutional reform which would result in the introduction of proportional representation. In addition, Kinnock was furious that The Sun published a highly emotive front-page on polling day, portraying Kinnock's face in a light bulb, and posing the question as to whether the last person out of the country in the event of a Labour victory could turn the lights out.

In conclusion, therefore, the flaws in the Labour campaign were important but not the root cause of the Labour defeat in the 1992 election. Rather, they were symptoms of the underlying problem facing Kinnock: that despite the recession, voters still trusted the Tories more on the economy and that Middle-England feared Kinnock as a potential PM and that he would revert to 'Old Labour' style 'Tax and Spend'. In short, Major was the safer option.
