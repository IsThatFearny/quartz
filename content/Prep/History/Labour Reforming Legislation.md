# Labour Reforming Legislation

</br>

### Which of the changes that took place under the Labour government were ahead of their time in terms of general acceptance – and met with media criticism and public hostility?

- Sexual Offences Act 1967 - Legalised homosexuality
- Abortion Act 1967 - Gave women the right to have an abortion no matter the circumstances
- Family Planning Act 1967 - Made contraception readily available through the NHS, many were hostile to the changes
- Divorce Reform Act 1969 - Removed the need for a guilty party in a divorce, allowed divorces to occur much more easily
- Race Relations Act 1968 - Made discrimination on the basis of race illegal
</br>

### What was Labour’s attitude to moral issues?

Labour did not wish to divide their party further on moral issues, and did not wish to divide the electorate either. They therefore did not publish any details of their stance on moral issues in their manifesto in any election year, in order not to put off potential voters.
</br>
### What are free votes – usually on moral issues?

Free votes are votes in which MPs are allowed to vote how they desire, without having to adhere to the party policy on the issue. Moral issues are usually voted on freely, so as to not divide the party.

### Why were the reforms brought about by private members bills in the 1960’s successful?

They were not affiliated with the government, and therefore many of them had cross-party support, meaning that they got more votes, more support, and were generally more successful than bills introduced by the government, who were often voted against by the opposition,
