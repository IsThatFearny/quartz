# Moss Comprehension 02-02-23

</br>

### 1) Why did Russia enter World War One "...with one foot in the modern world... the other imbedded in traditional Russia"?

The Tsars acknowledged the need for Russia to modernise, but were more comfortable with tradition and the class system of past years that they were reluctant to move forward significantly. They also felt that modernisation would, to an extent, undermine autocracy, and were not at all prepared for this to happen.

</br>

### 2) Account for the growth of the major cities

Factors that account for this include:

- Emancipation
- Better transport
- New opportunities in cities
- Declining urban mortality rate

All of this incentivised migration from rural areas to the cities, and are the main factors for their growth.

</br>

### 3) Moss paints a picture of Russian cities as vibrant, exciting places full of contrasts and variety. What evidence does he give to support this description?

Moss emphasises the cultural diversity of these cities. For example, he states that in Warsaw and Odessa, Jewish people made up one third of the population, and that in Riga, Latvians made up two fifths of the population, as did Russians and Germans combined. One tourist called this melting pot 'a valuable lesson in ethnography'. Moss speaks of electric trams and lighting beginning to take hold in the cities, and large shops (alongside hawkers and street vendors) also began to be established. He then says that cities were home to both the rich and poor, who lived alongside each other in (relative) harmony. The cities were home to people of great variety, and the opportunities that were available in them were very diverse.

</br>

### 4) What was the background of Russia's small entrepreneurial elite?

The background was very varied, with many entrepreneurs coming from humble backgrounds, while others came from nobility. They also had varying ethnicities, religious beliefs, etc,

</br>

### 5) Why and how was their political influence restricted?

This variation in backgrounds made it difficult for the group to 'speak with one voice'. Government actions were not strong enough to create unity, and often actually divided the elite. This lack of unity made it difficult for entrepreneurs to have any significant political influence.

</br>

### 6) What did the entrepreneurial elite do to try and correct this lack of political influence? How successful do you think they were?

The outbreak of political opposition caused many of them to greater political activity. They formed a Council of Representatives for Industry and Trade, and this council would often object to government policies, especially with regard to interference in business. In addition to this, there was an attempt to form the Progressive Party. The party advocated freedom of thought, religious belief, etc. This party was a vital part of the Duma's progressive bloc (although they were outnumbered by conservative parties). Political activism among these businessmen was relatively successful, and they were able to gain a foothold into politics.

</br>

### 7) Give 3 examples of economic growth

From 1860 - 1913:

- Pig iron increased by a factor of 14
- Coal increased by a factor of 120
- Railway track increased by a factor of 44

</br>

### 8) What '...trailed far behind that of other European powers...' in 1913? Why was this a problem?

The number of Russian corporations was few compared to the rest of Europe. This meant that they were not capable of growing their economy to the extent that other European powers could, and could not facilitate international and domestic trade as easily.

</br>

### 9) What was the significance of the Putilov company?

The Putilov company was a metalworking business based in St. Petersburg. It benefitted from state contracts and connections, and was therefore producing two-thirds of Russia's steel rails by 1870. By 1900, it ran the biggest factory in Russia, and was the most significant military supplier. It was nationalised during WWI, but before this it acted in a way that was very similar to its western counterparts.

</br>

### 10) Who owned 1/3 of the capital (investments) in Russian businesses at the start of WWI? 

Foreigners owned 1/3 of the capital in Russian Businesses, particularly the French, British, and Germans. They were especially prominent in the oil industry, and helped fund businesses operating in Russia. This led to many Russians thinking of capitalism as 'foreign' from Russia.

</br>

### 11) In 1913, how did Russia compare to other industrialised nations?

Russia still ranked far behind its western competitors. It produced 1/18 of the steel, 1/13 of the electricity, and 1/7 of the steel that was being produced by the same industries in the US. 

</br>

### 12) What do the per capita income statistics tell us about Russian economic progress by 1913?

On a GDP per capita basis, Russia ranked behind a majority of European powers, despite her immense size. Even countries such as Serbia and Bulgaria had more railway track per mile. This shows that Russian economic progress was still very limited when directly compared to other European powers in 1913.

</br>

### 13) What problems did workers face before the 1880s?

Labour legislation did not exist, and so workers could be made to work in excess of 12 hours a day. Women and children were paid less than men, and living conditions in urban factories were squalid and unhygienic. However, legislation prevented much of this from happening in later years.

</br>

### 14) How far did legislation in the 1880s improve matters?

An 1882 law prevented children aged 12-15 from working more than eight hours a day. Factory inspectors were introduced to inspect the conditions of the factory, and enforce changes if not up to standard. There was also legislation that enforced a maximum of 11.5 hours per day for all workers, and prohibited or limited night work or mining for women and adolescents. This improved things significantly.

</br>

### 15) How successful was the development of unions?

They were able to organise strikes (despite their illegality) and were an important development in worker's rights. However, they were clamped down upon and restricted, and industrial action was often illegal, so they had limited options when standing up for the rights of workers.

</br>

### 16) What impact did WWI have on the workforce?

Legislation was often ignored, with longer hours, less protection for women and children, and fewer safety measures being rolled out. Inflation was increasing faster than wages, and so workers found themselves working more for less.

</br>

### 17) Overall, can you sum up Walter Moss' views on industrial development in Russia in the period up to 1914?

When compared to other countries, Russia's development was significantly limited in terms of output (for her size), workers rights, etc. However, when put in the context of her social, economic and political issues, Russia was doing just about as well as she could, given the circumstances. However, the fact remains that her progression was far behind other powers, and this was difficult to remedy once WWI started.
