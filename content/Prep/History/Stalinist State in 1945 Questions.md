# Stalinist State in 1945 Questions


</br>

### What is the argument presented in the article about the difference in the USSR’s experience of a wartime economy?

Fitzpatrick argues that the Russian wartime economy contrasted greatly with the economies of other nations, both allies and axis. Whilst these countries increased government control and concentration of power, whilst also introducing a centralised economy during wartime, and this was considered their ‘war footing’, the argument of the article is that Soviet society was already on a ‘quasi-wartime’ footing from 1930 to the end of the Stalinist era, and so a ‘wartime economy’ was not experienced in the same way as other states.

### Why did Stalin put industrialisation on a war footing in the 1930s?

Fitzpatrick proposes that Stalin put industry on a war footing for two reasons: the first was a genuine fear of war. The Soviet Press and public were fearful of conflict, and perhaps Stalin was too. He used industrial growth as the backbone of ‘national survival’. Further, regardless of whether or not Stalin himself believed that war was imminent, placing industrialisation on a war footing allowed him to use it as a rallying point for the entire nation, in order to inspire patriotism and effort amongst the population. This especially applied to the first five year plan.

### Why did the first five year plan put industrialisation in a wartime status?

Throughout the plan, propaganda and news outlets frequently raised the alarm that war was imminent in Europe. The aims of the five year plan were considered by many to be a matter of life and death, and so rapid industrialisation was given the highest priority. New regulations were introduced in order to increase efficiency and labour productivity, enforced largely through terror and the threat of jailtime. The first five year plan used the threat of imminent war to place industrialisation at the top of the agenda in Russia.

### How did the first five year plan affect society?

The societal changes associated with the first five year plan were numerous: firstly, the dekulakisation process removed approx. 7 million Kulaks from society, deporting them to labour camps or sent to far-flung areas of the Soviet Union for resettlement. Whole categories of people suffered a similar fate. Rationing was re-introduced in 1929. Additionally, an internal passport system was reintroduced in 1933, requiring peasants to obtain permission from local authorities to leave the countryside. ‘Class enemies’ were refused permission for residence in major cities and forced to leave their homes.

### How did Labour control change in the 1930s up to 1940?

Labour control was a lot more rigorous and thorough in the early 1930s than in the latter part of tghe decade: in 1932, measures were introduced to prevent mobility of workers between jobs, in order to stop peasant influx into towns and reduce labour turnover; however, the aim of full control over labour was never achieved, because the People’s Commissariat of Labour was abolished. Labour control was relatively limited after this abolition in 1933, and most hiring was done at the factory gates on an individual basis.

### What demographic and geographical changes did WW2 cause to the Soviet workforce?

A large part of the male population were drafted into the war effort (20 million men by the end of the war). Additionally, much of the population moved around the country due to the threat of invasion and the imminent proximity of war. Perhaps as many as 17 million Soviet Citizens moved from territory occupied or threatened with occupation to a safer haven further east.

An exodus from the countryside also occurred as peasants were conscripted into military service. The collective farm population became over 11 million smaller. Women were given the responsibilities of men in their absence.

As well as this, adolescents were drafted into production and occasionally the armed forces directly from schools - 500,000 students were removed from the senior classes of high school to work in the civilian economy in the second half of 1941.
