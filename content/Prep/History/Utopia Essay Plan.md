# Utopia Essay Plan
</br>

## To what extent did the USSR of 1941 fulfil Lenin’s vision of a ‘Communist Utopia’?

</br>

### LOE 1: Did industrial prowess fulfil Lenin’s vision?

- Yes: Lenin’s vision was a fully industrialised and fully modernised state, which would come to fruition under Stalin’s  ‘Great Turn’.
	- The outcome of the first five year plan was a 300% increase in electricity production, a 200% increase in coal output, and steel production increased by one third
	- The second five year plan produced multiple infrastructure projects, e.g. the Volga Canal was finished in 1937, the Moscow Metro was opened in 1935, and the Dneiprostroi Dam became the largest dam in Europe
	- Large complexes such as Magnitogorsk exemplified a modernised Russia
- However: industry was not controlled by the workers, and utilised specialists and managers. This did not fulfil Lenin’s socialist vision.
	- The workers were not skilled enough to use industrial equipment
	- They often gave themselves large pay rises which were not proportional to their output
	- The presence of managers and specialists ensured that the workers were not able to take control, even if they were capable of doing so
- Overall, despite the lack of worker control, such rapid industrialisation and modernisation under Stalin means that it can be said that Lenin’s vision was, to a large extent, fulfilled.

### LOE 2: Did society fulfil Lenin’s vision?

- No: Lenin’s vision of a classless society was not achieved, and society failed to become more liberal by 1941
	- Divorce was discouraged, and traditional family values were promoted under Stalin (mothers with more than 6 children were given financial benefits and honours)
	- The separation of Church and state was reversed to an extent, and the church was given much more control over education and exercised more influence over the population
	- Wage differentials still existed, meaning that some got paid more than others
	- Wage discrimination existed also
	- Despite ‘dekulakisation’, some peasants were still able to engage in private enterprise and deepen class divisions
	- NEPmen held on to much of their wealth that they made during the NEP, and this allowed the middle class to thrive
- However: The purges made for a more classless society
	- Dekulakisation sent c. 10 million kulaks to Kulaks (with many being shot)
	- The upper classes were also purged
	- Those who betrayed the ideal of a ‘good citizen’ (e.g. were corrupt or made money from private industry) were shot or imprisoned
- Overall, whilst the class divides were not deepened, they were also not closed to the extent that Lenin envisioned, despite the removal of Kulaks and the upper classes.

### LOE 3: Did governance fulfil Lenin’s vision?

- No: Lenin had written about the withering of the state, but it seemed that the state was only getting stronger
	- The ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ was replaced by Stalin’s own dictatorship
	- Centralised government planning made the state stronger, and less devolved power to the soviets and to the workers prevented the state from withering away
	- Stalin’s 1936 constitution increased suffrage, but only the communist party had candidates and so it was not truly democratic
	- The central planning that the civil war required increased the dominance of the government
	- Stalin’s cabinet were largely ‘yes-men’ who were scared of Stalin and would do whatever he said. This meant that Stalin’s power over the government only increased
- Overall, the strengthening of the state meant that Lenin’s vision of a communist utopia was not fulfilled to any extent, because the government would not just ‘wither away’ as he had hoped.
