## p.317 - 319

### 1) What did the assassination of Alexander II, in 1881, reveal about the state of Russia

It revealed that the citizens of Russia were unhappy with their circumstances, and wanted change. There was significant opposition to autocracy and tsarism, and therefore it was decided that reform must be brought about to prevent further opposition.

</br>

### 2) What did Loris-Melikhov argue was needed to deal with opposition? What does this suggest about Alexander II's intentions as Tsar?

Loris-Melikhov argued that it was not possible to control the population using the police and the military, and that social and political reforms were the only way to keep the population happy. He insisted that the government must be seen to be doing things for the good of the people. This suggests that Alexander's intentions were noble, as he intended to 'attract the support of the general public' instead of turning Russia into a police state.

</br>

### 3) What measures did Loris-Melikhov propse?

He proposed measures to "strengthen society's trust in the government and induce social forces to support the administration more actively than they do now"

</br>

### 4) What were Pobedonostev's views of reform? What does his influence on Alexander III suggest about his intentions as Tsar?

He denounced reform fully (he was a devout orthodox church member, and held the title of 'Procurator of the Holy Synod'). He believed that it would pave the way to a western-style constitution, and that autocracy would be severely weakened or even destroyed. His influence on Alexander III suggests that Alexander's intention was purely to preserve autocracy in the face of opposition,

</br>

### 5) What policies did Dmitrii Tolstoy introduce as Minister of the Interior? What does this suggest about the reign of Alexander III?

Tolstoy introduced 'land commandants', who oversaw several *volosti*. They were able to overrule court and local government decisions, and were elected by the gentry of the region.  This was an attempt to re-centralise power in autocracy, and is evidence that Alexander III's reign was one of reaction.
</br>

### 6) What does Hosking argue about the state of Russia under Alexander III? Do you agree?#

Hosking argues that Russia was '[hovering] uneasily between two incompatible systems'. I agree with him, as there is evidence to show that Alexander III's reign was simply not reactionary enough to revert Russia back to it's old ways in the days before the emancipation edict. Peasant's rights contradicted and clashed with each other, and government and courts existed, but had little authority. Russia was noncommittal to either system, and therefore the country was effectively in gridlock.

</br>

## p.355-358

### 1) What were Russia's economic needs in the 19th Century?

She urgently needed to be able to mobilize resources more efficiently, raise the prosperity of the population (rise in living standards), to create funding to use in internal investment, and to stabilise the economy.

</br>

### 2) What infrastructure development was needed to develop Russia's economy? Why was this difficult to develop?

Russia needed railways to develop her economy, however this was difficult to implement for two main reasons: money and size. Russia lacked the funding to build the railways, and her incredible size made it both more expensive to build and more of a logistical challenge.

</br>

### 3) How did these economic problems link to the emancipation of the serfs? Does this influence our interpretation of Alexander II's reforms?

One of the primary causes of the issues facing the economy was the compensation of serf owners, which made balancing the budget deficit particularly tricky. To resolve this, Alexander III set about reforming the economy further, specifically in relation to the peasant class, creating the peasant land bank in 1860 and joint-stock banks subsequently in order to incentivise investment.

</br>

### 4) Was the development of the railways a success?

In relative terms, yes. Russia had done well in building them considering her size and economic situation, and they certainly improved industrial efficiency and communications.

</br>

### 5) What were the weaknesses of Russian Indiustralisation

- A vast majority of the population lived in rural areas with little industry, and therefore there was a labour shortage
- Cottage industry and heavy industry existed side by side, with nothing between them
- Living conditions were poor for urban workers

</br>

### 6) What impact did industrialisation have on peasants?

- Families were divided when men went into cities to work and were unable to take their families with them
- Living conditions were poor for peasants
- Very little disposable income, made for poor consumerism in Russia

</br>

### 7) What measures did Vyshnegradskii introduce to help Russia industrialise?

He introduced higher taxes (liquor excise for example) and imposed a high tariff on imports to stimulate the domestic market. This allowed the Ruble to stabilize and be placed on the gold standard, which significantly increased foreign confidence in the economy.

</br>

### 8) Why was there opposition to Vyshnegradskii's policies?

- Landowners complained that they were finding it more expensive to invest in industrial machinery
- It became more difficult to export grain
- Trading partners raised their own tariffs
- Policies considered 'un-Russian'

</br>

### 9) What are the two different interpretations of the impact of industrialisation on peasants?

1) Serfs were emancipated on terms which prevented them from bettering themselves; given too little land, not enough money, no access to industry
2) Recent statistics suggest that peasants were indeed able to buy land, that communes were in fact not holding them back, and that they were able to sell grain for a profit. This shows that some peasants, though certainly not all, were able to better themselves through industrialisation

</br>

### 10) How does Hosking reconcile these different interpretations?

Hosking says that a regional perspective must be taken, as industrialisation was very different in different regions across Russia. Each interpretation applied in some places, but not others, and therefore they are both accurate, just never at the same time.

</br>

### 11) What impact do you think industrialisation would have had on Tsarist Russia? In the context of the socio-economic forces of the time, would Alexander III's policies have stabilised Russia?

Industrialisation would certainly have destabilised Tsarism to an extent. The general population was given the means to better themselves, and this would have lead to an increase in education and give rise to opposition groups. This would have been a great concern for autocracy. Alexander III's policies, though repressive, were able to stabilise Russia and rid it of the opposition that he was facing. Whilst in hindsight, his reforms limited the growth and development of Russia, it was relatively stable, as was autocracy.

</br>

## p.359-361

### 1) How effective was Alexander III in suppressing opposition in the 1890s?

Alexander III was very effective in this task. He tracked down and brought to justice the central committee of Narodnya Volya (who assassinated his father), prevented any opposition groups from rising into prominence, and ensured that police (an enlarged force) attention was focused on censorship of western and revolutionary ideas.

</br>

### 2) How did opposition change in the 1890s? Does this suggest a more stable Tsarist state?

Opposition became subversive and secret. Organisations had perfected the technique of infiltration and subtlety, and it became harder for the police to discover their activity. This is certainly not indicative of a stable Tsarist state, and Alexander III's suppression of political opposition actually caused him more problems in the long run.

</br>

### 3) What did the actions of Evno Azef suggest about Tsarist Russia?

Evno Azef was a police agent who commanded the fighting detachment of the SRs. He and his detachment conspired against their own employers, and assassinated multiple members of government. This suggests that Tsarist Russia was incredibly unstable, and a place in which no one could be trusted.

</br>

### 4) What did Plekhanov argue about the state of Russia in the 1880s, in the context of Marx's communist model? Do you have any evidence to support this?

Plekhanov argued that capitalism must play out its cause, the the proletariat must become exhausted; only then can revolution take place. This was in kind with Marx's own prediction about the fall of capitalism caused *by* capitalism. 

</br>

### 5) What was the debate between 'populists' and 'marxists'? What did this suggest about the stability of Autocracy at this time?

The populists held the belief that had its own path of social evolution, whereas the marxists believed that it must follow the descent of capitalism as in other countries (although delayed due to slow industrialisation). These conflicting views suggested that Autocracy and the Tsar did not have a plan for Russia's future, and that Autocracy was becoming unstable.

</br>

## p.362-365

### 1) What social changes did the political and economic reforms of the 19th century cause in Tsarist Russia?

The entire country was moving away from a system based upon what was, in essence, slavery. For the peasants, this was a good thing, but for the Tsars, it was the beginning of the end. The half-hearted reforms and subsequent reaction caused distrust in the government, and opposition soon sprung up. Reform only served to destabilise autocracy further, culminating in the Bloody Sunday massacre, and then the 1917 revolution.

### 2) What impact did urbanisation have on the new working classes, and why was this dangerous to Tsarist Russia?

Urbanisation brought with it radicalisation, and access to education and higher thinking. In addition, it began to cause religion to decline. This again threatened autocracy, and significantly destabilised it.

</br>

### 3) Did the policies of Alexander III prepare Russia for the social changes in Russia during the late 19th century - early 20th century?

No, they did not. Even more social change was to come, in the form of strikes and revolution. Alexander III's policies were not enough to dissuade the population from their revolutionary ideas, and Russia (and autocracy) was not at all prepared for the big changes that were to come in the near future.
