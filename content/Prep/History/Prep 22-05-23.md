## What was Bloody Sunday? How did it lead to an escalation of the troubles?

Bloody Sunday, on 30th of January 1972, was a march turned massacre. NICRA organised a march to protest against internment. The British army was ordered to control the march, and to do so they used live ammunition. Twenty-six unarmed civilians were shot, and thirteen were killed on the day. This was a turning point, as it marked the moment when the British army were no longer seen as ‘protectors’ of the Catholics and Republicans, rather they were now seen as the enemy by both sides.

## What were the diplock courts?

Diplock courts were Northern Irish courts, introduced in 1973, that held trials without a jury. These trials tended to be before a single judge, and for specific serious offences, such as arson, murder, and other common crimes during the troubles. Conviction rates in these courts were significantly higher. The diplock courts are said to have undermined democracy and the idea that everyone should be tried by a jury of their peers.


## Why did the Sunningdale agreement fail?

Sunningdale proposed power-sharing, a new Northern Ireland Assembly, and a council of Ireland. However, both sides were opposed to this, denouncing it as a sell out. The UUP pulled support for the Conservative party. The Ulster Workers’ Council was established in 1974, with the primary aim of bringing down the Executive. They organised a strike for 15th May 1974, and this limited communications and power. A state of emergency was declared. Less than two weeks later, Faulkner resigned as the Chief Executive of the power-sharing Executive, and Wilson was forced to impose direct rule. This caused the collapse of the Sunningdale agreement.
