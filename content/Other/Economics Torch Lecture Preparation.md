## Introduction

Hello everybody, and welcome to tonight’s Economics torch lecture. We have before us an exciting opportunity to hear from two very knowledgeable economists about their views on various key aspects of the economics course, as well as on current affairs in the economy. There will also be time for a Q&A at the end of the discussion, so you’ll get a chance to ask our guests your questions.





To my left/right is Maxwell Marlow, and to my left/right is Theo Harris. Both work for leading think tanks,  organisations of experts who give advice on political and economic problems.

Maxwell is currently the Director of Research at the Adam Smith Institute, an organisation which promotes free-market, neo-liberal ideas. Their key policies include: low and simple taxes to stimulate growth; freedom of choice over education; a privately-provided, publicly-funded NHS; liberalisation of planning regulations; and a reformed welfare system. Maxwell is also a fellow of the Consumer Choice Center, an organisation which focuses on empowering consumers. He has written for the Times and the Telegraph, among other publications, and has made appearances on TV channels such as TalkTV and GBNews.

Theo is currently an Assistant Researcher at the New Economic Foundation, a group which focuses on promoting green and sustainable policies. Their key commitments include: a New Social Settlement to improve quality of life; a Green New Deal, which is to say the government-led investment in and promotion of environmental consciousness; and a democratic economy, including devolution of power and the transformation of economic ownership. Theo is particularly interested in inequality and environmental policy, and has recently published research which proposes a ‘green interest rate’ for net-zero investments.

Both Maxwell and Theo will have some very interesting insights into the questions we ask them this evening, so make sure that you listen carefully. Perhaps think of some questions to ask at the end? So without further ado, lets get started…
