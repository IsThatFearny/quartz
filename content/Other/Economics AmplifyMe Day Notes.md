### How the market works

- Investor likes Tesla –> decides to buy shares in Tesla –> shifts demand to the right –> price increases
- Investor dislikes Tesla prospects –> decides to sell shares in Tesla –> shifts supply to the right –> price decreases





</br>

### Internal factors which affect share price

- Profitability changes/earnings reports
- Product variety
- Productivity changes
- M&A
- Firm behaviour (e.g. scandals, restructuring)





</br>

### External factors which affect share price

- Interest rate changes - rise = decrease in price (most important)
- Competitiveness of a country
- Relative prices/adjacent markets
- Regulation changes
- Inflation - rise = decrease in price
- Unemployment - variable… high unemployment can be a signal of recession, which can cause banks to lower interest rates… but can also cause lack of business confidence
- GDP changes - variable… high levels of confidence causes share prices to rise… but there may be an inflationary risk, causing an increase in interest rates
