# The Nature of Moral Anti-Realism

</br>

### What is ‘error theory’?

Mackie argues (in agreement with Moral Realism) that we understand moral judgements to be cognitive. That is, the way we use moral language is to express beliefs about mind-independent moral properties (this is how moral language functions). Mackie is an anti-realist, arguing that all moral judgements are false: ‘killing is wrong’ is false because the property of being wrong is non-existent. This is our error: ethical language rests on a mistake: there is no moral reality.

A claim is objective if a) it can be something we know; and b) it can be true or false; c) its truth is independent of what we want/choose; d) it is about something mind-independent; e) it is about some aspect of reality. Mackie argues that moral judgements meet none of these criteria because there are no moral properties.

### Is Mackie’s error theory true?

Moral realists can reply that Mackie’s theory misunderstands what it is for a moral property to be objective: specifically, Mackie fails to recognise that moral judgements can be mind-independent (by being objectively true or false) whilst still  being dependent on minds to exist - it may be that moral judgements are about psychological properties such as happiness.

### Explain why non-cognitivist meta-ethical theories are anti-realist

Non-cognitivist theories do not claim that ethical languages seek to describe the way the world is (so ‘anti-realist’); instead moral language expresses beliefs or non-cognitive mental states (emotions/feelings) (so, non-cognitivist).

</br>

### Explain ‘speaker subjectivism’ and one objection to it

Speaker subjectivism claims that ‘the meaning of $x$ is wrong’ is equivalent to ‘I disapprove of $x$’/‘I think that $x$ is wrong’. By this thesis, moral judgements are cognitive psychological facts: i.e. they report or assert your own/another’s approval, e.g. ‘Jemima feels that killing is wrong’ Does she? Ask Jemima.

Thus, speaker subjectivism is a form of reductive moral naturalism: the facts that make moral judgements true are facts about the speaker’s mind. So, speaker subjectivism entails that we cannot be wrong about what is right or wrong: if I say ‘killing is right’, I am simply expressing approval.

However, there are criticisms raised towards speaker subjectivism. It makes a nonsense of the process of ethical debate/deliberation to discover what is right or wrong - there is no such search, ethical language merely expresses what we feel at a given moment.

</br>

### What is the difference between subjectivism and emotivism?

Emotivism claims that moral judgements express feelings of approval/disapproval (and so is non-cognitive) whereas speaker subjectivism argues that moral judgements report a kind of truth or falsity (and so is cognitive).

</br>

### Explain a) Ayer’s and b) Stevenson’s argument supporting emotivism

Ayer takes his point of departure from the verification principle; which he uses to disprove cognitivism: propositions are meaningful if and only if they are analytically or empirically verifiable. Moral propositions are neither, so do not state facts; they are merely expressions of emotions. So, moral propositions are mere expressions of emotion. The functional difference between emotivism and subjectivism is that the latter argues that moral judgements inform or report (on the nature of (subjective) reality) whereas emotivism argues that moral judgements serve the function of influencing others’ attitudes. 

One advantage of emotivism is that it easily explains how/why moral judgements are motivational: for the emotive, moral language is not simply descriptive, which brings with it the problem of how it motivates us. Emotivism avoids this problem by focusing on what we care about, connecting care, approval/disapproval with the fundamental meaning of ethical language. This is Stevenson’s basic point: moral words have emotive meanings, which are not descriptive. ‘Right’ and ‘wrong’ only express approval/disapproval; though many moral terms (‘steal’, ‘respect’, etc.) have both descriptive and emotive meanings - i.e. to be told that ‘Hector is respectful’ is to learn something about Hector. 

</br>

### According to Hare, what are the two types of prescriptive meaning?

The first type of prescriptive meaning is imperative: moral judgements that tell someone to do something. Hare argues that some moral judgements work in the same way as the command ‘shut your mouth’. Thus, ‘eating meat is wrong’ entails the imperative ‘don’t eat meat’.

The second type of prescriptive meaning is value judgements: general value terms (‘good’ and ‘bad’) are used to commend something to someone - e.g. ‘Barbie is a feminist masterpiece’ - which provides guidance for our choices/actions. N.B. these are not as explicit as commands.

</br>

### Explain the distinction between commending and describing

The distinction between commending and describing: descriptions communicate factual information, e.g. ‘strawberries are sweet and juicy’; commending expresses praise and approval, e.g. ‘sweet and juicy strawberries are the best fruit ever’.

</br>

### Explain what Hare means by ‘morally good’

What we mean by ‘morally good’ is that we are appealing to a set of moral standards that apply to someone as a person. That said, there are no facts to establish one set of moral standards as objectively correct, so we have to adopt them ourselves. 

</br>

### 10

- Emotivism: Moral judgements are non-cognitive statements that express approval/disapproval
- Prescriptivism: Moral judgements are non-cognitive but intended as instructions

Thus, for emotivism, the meaning of ‘good’ is as a means of influencing others. And this can also be said of prescriptivism. The difference, nonetheless, is for prescriptivism the good is defined in terms of a set of standards that we adopt and can discuss/challenge in terms of their coherence, with other standards in the ‘set’

</br>

### 11

By ‘universalising’ our moral judgements, Hare means that two actions in similar situations must either be right or wrong, e.g. it can’t be right for $x$ to steal from $y$, if it is wrong for $y$ to steal from $x$ - there is an inconsistency (incoherence) here that might be challenged (and thus the basis for moral discourse is restored).
