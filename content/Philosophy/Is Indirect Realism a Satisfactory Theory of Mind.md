# Is Indirect Realism a Satisfactory Theory of Mind?

</br>

## Intro

Indirect Realism is the claim that we do not perceive the external world directly, rather through sense-data, which is a mental formation of the content of physical objects and their properties. In this essay, I will argue that Indirect Realism is not satisfactory theory of mind, primarily because of the argument from the veil of perception.

</br>

## Outline (Overview of IR/5 marker explanation)

</br>

## Argument 1

- Veil of Perception leads to scepticism about the external world
</br>

## Criticism 1

- External world is best hypothesis due to coherence and involuntary nature of perception'
</br>

## Evaluation 1

- Issues of other people's perception; best hypothesis is still uncertainty. Existence of the external world to be more than a hypothesis.
</br>

## Argument 2

- Issues with sense-data as resembling the external world (Berkeley)
</br>

## Criticism 2

- Primary and Secondary qualities; correlation with our experience, rather than identity
</br>

## Evaluation 2

- Issue remains with our access to the external world - the response fails to resolve veil of perception problem.
</br>

## Conclusion

In conclusion, scepticism forces Indirect Realism to collapse as if, as the Indirect Realism claims, our perception is separated from the external world by the veil of perception, we cannot get beyond this to know about physical objects and their properties. Given that Indirect Realism needs to secure a mind-independent external world, the threat of scepticism is a significant problem.
