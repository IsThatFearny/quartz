# What does it mean to say that God exists?

- There is a being in the universe called ‘God’. This is a factual statement about something in the world.
- Express a belief in a higher being. This is a statement about one’s attitude towards/understanding of the world
- Reflects an approach to or feeling about the world. This is a spiritual, rather than a factual statement, i.e. an article of faith

There are two approaches in Philosophy of Language: Cognitivism and Non-Cognitivism

> 'God exists' is meaningful because it has truth value - it can be true or false; a factual statement which refers to something out there in the world
> 
> <h4>Non-Cognitivism</h4>
> 
> 'God exists' is a statement of attitude or perspective; its meaning lies in its impact on me, rather than any truth value (it is neither true or false)

### Arguments for taking a cognitivist approach to religious language

- ‘God exists’ is something we can prove/disprove using reason and/or empiricial evidence
- Allows us to challenge and analyse religious beliefs - if non-cognitivism is true, I cannot meaningfully discuss your belief, e.g. the flying spaghetti monster
- There is a universality to religious language, and people who use it refer to beings with ‘real existence’. Therefore it only makes sense to talk about God’s existence in a cognitivist sense.

### Arguments for taking a non-cognitivist approach to religious language

- You cannot reason to or prove God’s existence - it is a matter of faith, rather than fact
- Believers talk about faith as being meaningful to them, but are not necessarily making truth claims about the world

### Ayer’s verification principle

Ayer would argue that the statement ‘God exists’ is neither analytically true nor empirically verifiable, and therefore the statement is meaningless
