# Issues with Perception

</br>

(For context there was a pencil in a glass of water on the desk)

- Is the refracted image of the pencil an accurate representation of reality? i.e. is the pencil broken or straight
- How can we know that the pencil, or indeed the glass, is really there?
	- Could be a simulated reality
	- Could be a dream
	- Are our senses always reliable?

Perception is a concern for empiricists, since they claim that we can know about the external world through the senses

There are three main positions:

- Direct realism (na√Øve realism)
- Indirect Realism (representative realism)
- Idealism

Realism means that there is objective truth or falsehood in the world (In this case, there is an objective external world, which is true or false regardless of our perception)
</br>


## Direct Realism

Direct realism is the claim that the immediate content of my perception is mind-independent physical objects and their properties

My perception: what I immediately see, smell, hear, etc.
Mind-independent physical object: objective objects ('things') which have physical form
Properties: nature of the objects, e.g. square, brown etc.


</br>

### The Argument from Perceptual Variation

When I look at the table (Russell's example), I perceive different qualities according to light, angle, proximity, etc.

The variations happen within the object itself, e.g. colour is different in different places and between different observers, Hannah perceives a different colour to Violet

Direct realism has to say that the object's properties are constantly changing, since Direct Realism claims that we perceive what is there, e.g. dark red colour. But objects have fired properties - the table is dark red or not - so this is absurd and Direct realised fails to account for Perceptual Variation.

'There is a red pillar box that appears grey'. Russell claims that the colour of the table is separate from the reality of the table itself. But, Jackson claims that the appearance of an object belongs to the object itself. In this case, 'appearing grey' is a relational property of the red pillar box, i.e. it has the property of appearing grey in $x$ conditions.

6PhiC's concerns:

- Where do these properties exist? It is a strange kind of property which only exists in certain circumstances.
- There is a difference between objective, physical colour and the way that colour appears - Russell's focus is on our perception of the colour.

</br>

### The Argument from Illusion

In the case of the pencil in the water, I perceive a crooked pencil. The Direct Realist must conclude that the pencil is crooked (what I perceive is what is). However, we know that the pencil only appears crooked - when we take it out, it is straight.

Direct Realism replies to this by saying that the pencil has the relational property of looking crooked in water.

</br>

### The Argument from Hallucination (Disjunctive theory of Perception)

David is perceiving a giant strawberry. This is a hallucination, because David has been taking naughty things. There isn't really a giant strawberry there at all. The Direct Realist has to say that David is perceiving a giant strawberry. This is obviously absurd.

In this case, David's perception is not coherent - the rest of his senses and that of others does not confirm the existence of the strawberry. A hallucination is a different brain process to perception. David's brain is working differently from when he perceives reality.

</br>

### Argument from Time-Lag

How we perceive is not as straight forward as Direct Realism suggests. Hector's perception of the box is delayed - he sees/feels/smells the box as it was a millisecond or so ago. Therefore, we do not perceive physical objects directly. Rather, we perceive them indirectly via our senses and in the past. 

The reply to this is that this criticism is about how we perceive, rather than the content of any perception; the time lag is so miniscule that it is irrelevant.

</br>

### Openness: The appeal of Direct Realism

Direct Realism understands perception as a form of 'openness' (our direct awareness of and connection with the external world) to the world.

If we propose a medium such as sense-data, the we lose this openness - we perceive the world via another method and this seems counter-intuitive.

N.B. this will remain a problem for indirect realism and will be a problem which idealism attempts to solve.

</br>

## Indirect Realism

N.B. This is also known as 'representative realism'
</br>

The counter examples presented (illusion, hallucination, etc.) suggest that we do not perceive the world directly. Instead, the Indirect Realist wants to claim that we perceive the external world indirectly through sense-data.

So, Indirect Realism claims that the immediate content of my perception is sense data (content of our perceptual experience - mental, only exists when being perceived, private and part of the mind, represents the physical objects, can be accurate or inaccurate) which represents and is caused by physical objections and properties.

In cases such as illusion, etc. we are perceiving e.g. the crooked pencil, but this 'crooked pencil' is actually sense-data rather than the object itself.
</br>

### Issues with Perceptual Variation

For an indirect realist, the immediate content of my perception is sense-data, which resembles mind-independent physical objects and their properties.

If all we perceive is sense-data, then it seems that there is a 'veil of perception' separating us (and our perception) from the external world. So we can never know about either the native of the existence of the external world. This theory of perception is scepticism.

Locke's response to this is that we can know about primary qualities, which exist in and belong to the object.
