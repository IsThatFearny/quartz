# Is Indirect Realism satisfactory?
</br>
Indirect Realism, the claim that we can only perceive the external world through sense-data, is not a satisfactory claim, and is too open to scepticism. Responses to criticisms and defences of the theory are all too weak for it to be considered as such.

Indirect Realism claims that we can only perceive the external world through-sense data, which is the medium through which we perceive (such as vision, hearing, and other senses). However, the obvious response to this is the indirect nature of our perception does not allow us to 'know' about the existence of the external world.
