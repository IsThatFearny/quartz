# Philosophical Behaviourism

### What is the problem of other minds as faced by the dualist?

There can be no empirical evidence to test the existence of other minds, and therefore we cannot meaningfully say that other minds are real/exist.

#### Revised

Problem of other minds: we cannot know that there are other minds since we only experience ‘the mind’ privately, through introspection. I only experience other people’s behaviour so other minds are a hypothesis at best. For the dualist, this is an issue because the mind is a separate substance to the body, and so its existence can be doubted independently of scepticism about the body.
</br>
### How does philosophical behaviourism explain the mind?

Philosophical behaviourism claims that the mind is simply what a person says or does (behaviours). All statements concerning mental states or processes are not concerned with a private world, rather, talk about minds is reducible to talk of behaviour.
#### Revised

Philosophical behaviouralism claims that minds are just what people say and do - they are not private or accessed through introspection. Talk of mental states is analytically reducible (i.e. reducible without remainder) to talk about behavioural states.
</br>

### Explain what is meant by:

#### Analytic behaviourism

Analytic behaviourism is so named because analysis of the language of mind reveals that all can be reduced to statements about behaviour.

#### Analytic reduction.

Analytic reduction means that statements about minds mean the same as statements about behaviour in the same way that ‘mother’ means ‘female parent’.

##### Revised

Analysis of language of minds leads to simple statements of behaviour, e.g. pain (mental state) = screaming, crying, etc. (pain behaviour)

</br>

### How does philosophical behaviourism resolve the issue of other minds?

Philosophical behaviourism argues that we can observe another person’s behaviour, and since behaviour is alike with mind, it is reasonable to believe that said person has a mind, and thus other minds exist.

#### Revised

Philosophical behaviourism eliminates the problem of other minds because minds = behaviours; to know someone’s mental state is to observe their behaviours.
</br>

### Outline the three arguments for philosophical behaviourism.

1) The dualist admits that we have access to the behaviour of others, and therefore behaviour must be the basis for all of our language about others. Theories such as Ayer’s verification principle reject the idea that other minds could be isolated from the possibility of detection. Talk of things which cannot be verified is meaningless, and the failure to recognise this means that dualists become concerned with the problem of other minds. Behaviourism eliminates this problem by equating mind with what observable behaviour.

2) Behaviourism overcomes the interaction problem that plagues substance dualism. If the mind is not a distinct substance or property that is somehow linked to the body, then there is no causal interaction to account for.

3) If words acquire their meaning from the context in which they are used, then it follows that there are rules which determine their proper usage. Therefore, it must be possible to determine whether they are being used correctly through comparison to what is observable. However, if mental-state terms acquire their meaning through reference to private experiences within each of our minds, it is impossible to tell whether the words are being used correctly or not (as there is no public context by which to compare them). Talk of mind would become impossible. Therefore, when we talk of minds, we *must* be talking about what is publicly observable in order to avoid confusion and retain any meaning.

#### Revised

1) If, as the dualist claims, we have access to others’ behaviours, then this behaviour must be the basis of our knowledge about others. Dualism faces the problem of other minds but philosophical behaviourism focuses on what is observable, and therefore avoids the problem and meets the verification principle.
 
 2) Overcomes the interaction problem as there is no causal link between mind and body

3) There are public rules governing the use of words; if mental states are only private, we cannot talk meaning fully about them. Philosophical behaviourism means we can talk meaningfully about mental states.

### Explain how Hempel’s hard behaviourism is influenced by the work of the Vienna Circle.

The Vienna Circle promoted *logical positivism*, a form of empiricism which proposes that a meaningful proposition must have empirical content and thus make positive claims about our experience. Hempel, therefore, adhered to the verificationist account of meaning. Since other minds cannot be observed, talk about them is either meaningless or reducible to what can be observed, which for Hempel means that meaningful talk about human minds require evidence that our claims about them can be reduced to behavioural descriptions.

#### Revised

Hempel’s behaviourism adheres to the verificationist theory of meaning. 

### Use the examples of Dolores and Paul to illustrate Hempel’s hard behaviourism.

Suppose that Dolores has trodden on a nail, and is in significant pain, swearing, shouting, and attempting to remove the nail from her foot. Hempel says that this behaviour must constitute what it means to say that she is in pain, as the pain is not a private experience which causes Dolores’ behaviour, but just is the behaviour. 

Hempel gives his own example of ‘Paul has a toothache’. He proposes multiple test sentences which would provide the circumstances in which the statement would be verified, for example: ‘Paul weeps and makes gestures of such and such kinds’, ‘At the question ‘what is the matter?’ Paul responds ‘I have a toothache’, ‘closer examination reveals a decayed tooth’, etc etc.

All of these circumstances verify the statement that ‘Paul has a toothache’.

#### Revised

Paul has a toothache. We know this because: 

- We can observe neurophysiological states in his brain
- We can observe tooth decay
- He is screaming (apparently)
- He says ‘I have a toothache’
- His nervous system indicates pain, e.g. high blood pressure

This is the only way to establish Paul’s mental state (of pain) - all we have is behaviour.

## Philosophical Behaviourism Final Thoughts + Initial Issues

</br>

### Explain Ryle’s claim that there is nothing essentially private about thinking

Ryle claims that thinking to ourselves is simply *internalised speaking*. Speaking, he argues, is an overt behaviour, and we only acquire the ability to think with effort. The fact that we are speaking only with ourselves and the resulting silence is inessential to the nature of thinking. Whether the process is public or private is irrelevant to whether it is thinking. Processes that take place silently don’t define thinking any more than those that take place as publicly observable behaviours.

#### Revised

Thinking is often not a separate process from ‘doing’ - it is linked with actions and behaviours, e.g. Mrs Fairley is annoyed with Will (thought) –> Mrs Fairley has an angry tone and a disappointed face (action). Thoughts without actions are not essentially private, since they can be publicly available - they do not belong in the head or have real existence.

</br>

### Explain, with reference to category mistakes, why Ryle rejects both MBTIT and Eliminative Materialism

Analysis of our mental concepts demonstrates that they do not work in the same way as our physical concepts - physical explanations use categorical concepts, whereas mental concepts are dispositional. Thus, Ryle argues that both MBTIT and Eliminative Materialism make category mistakes: MBTIT equates the physical with the mental (and if the two have different properties then they cannot be the identical); Eliminative Materialism does likewise.

#### Revised

Mental concepts are in a different category from physical concepts. MBTIT and Eliminative Materialism make a category mistake in treating mental concepts as physical concepts.

</br>

### Explain why philosophical behaviourism is a form of physicalism

Philosophical behaviourism is a form of physicalism because it argues that there is no distinct psychological reality. Not because the theory eliminates them, but because questions about the mind are not the same as questions about what exists - these are answered by natural science. For Ryle, dispositions aren’t additional properties, and are expressed in hypothetical statements rather than categorical ones. Therefore, saying ‘if this happens, then this will happen’ doesn't state anything about what exists, and Philosophical Behaviourism is a physicalist theory.

</br>

### Summarise philosophical behaviourism in no more than 250 words

Philosophical behaviourism is the theory that the meaning of mental concepts can be analysed in terms of ‘behaviour’. Because it rejects the notion of a distinct psychological reality, and argues that talking about mental states is not the same as talking about what exists, it is a form of physicalism. Hempel’s ‘hard’ behaviourism posits that the meaning of a statement is established by the conditions of its verification. Thus, statements using mental states can be translated into statements about the conditions of verifying such claims using behaviour. Ryle argues for a form of ‘soft’ behaviourism, arguing that mental states can be understood as behavioural dispositions (dispositions being how something will or is likely to behave under certain circumstances). Dispositions that are mental states Ryle says to be ‘infinitely heterogenous’. Statements using mental concepts work at a higher level of generality than individual statements about behaviour. Ryle also argues that thinking is either part of what it is to act thoughtfully, or alternatively internalised speech. Thinking is not necessarily private.



# Soft Behaviourism Questions
</br>

### What is a Disposition?

A disposition is how something will, or is likely to, behave under certain circumstances. For example, solubility is a disposition - sugar is soluble, but it isn’t necessarily dissolving at the present moment. Dispositions can be expressed using ‘if… then’ statements, such as ‘if I place a sugarcube in water, then it will dissolve’.

</br>

### Explain the Claim that May Mental Concepts Are Dispositional Concepts

When we talk about someone having a certain mental state, we are really talking of what they would/could do in certain circumstances or situations. E.g. in saying that someone has the mental state of pride, we are saying that they may manifest pride in certain scenarios. Some mental concepts refer to complex dispositions (indefinitely heterogenous dispositions), the example given being that pride can manifest in many various subtle ways.

</br>

## Compare and Contrast Hempel’s ‘hard’ Behaviourism and Ryle’s ‘soft’ Behaviourism

Hard behaviourism asserts that all propositions about mental states can be reduced, without loss of meaning, to propositions about behaviour and physical states. By contrast, soft behaviourism states that propositions about mental states are simply propositions about behavioural dispositions, i.e. what someone would likely do in a certain set of circumstances.

</br>

### How Does Logical Behaviourism Solve the Problem of other Minds?

To understand what others say and do (i.e. their behaviour) is to understand that they have minds. We can know this because we can know that they behave in particular ways. The link between behaviour and minds is purely logical rather than empirical.

## Is Philosophical Behaviourism a Successful Theory of Mind?

</br>

### Dualist Arguments

#### Conceivability

Mind without body is conceivable - because we can conceive of them as separate things, they cannot be the same

##### Response

- The conditions for verification are empirical or analytic truth, so only behaviour can provide explanations of mental states. Mind without body (behaviour) fails the verification principle.
- Mind does not exist in the same way that bodies exist - dualism commits a category mistake.

</br>

### Indivisibility

Mind and body have separate properties - the physical is spatially divisible, but the mind is not.

##### Response

- Mental properties are not distinct from physical/behavioural properties; category mistake

</br>

### Evaluation

Ryle’s category mistake begins from a position of physicalism and therefore assumes that there is nothing over and above the physical. In his example of the university, we might argue that he has rather missed the point and that ‘Oxford University’ is not completely defined by its content; instead, here is some thing which is Oxford University, however intangible that is.

</br>

### Other Issues
#### Multiple Realisability

Mental states can be realised in multiple ways, therefore we cannot produce a clear and finite list of behavioural (mental states).

#### Circularity

We cannot talk about conditions of verification for mental states without reference to other mental states.

</br>

#### Hempel’s Response

Brain processes remain the same, even while behavioural states differ; behavioural states can be seen as a secondary part of brain states. We should focus primarily an physiological states.

</br>

#### Ryle’s Response

Dispositional statements are ‘open’ and so cannot be completely replaced by hypothetical statements, e.g. pain could be any number of dispositions - scream, cry, run away, stoicism

##### Response to Ryle

- It is unclear whether there is any stable connection between mental and behavioural states

- Openness is too vague; if mental state x could = infinite behaviours/dispositions, it is not clear that we could establish a certain translation from mental to behaviourial states

- Liebniz’s law: if 2 things share all the same properties, they are identical, so mental states ≠ behavioural states, since the properties may vary. 

Ryle argues in response that Liebniz’s law is about metaphysical identity so does not apply to his theory, as he is providing an analysis of meaning rather than a metaphysical identity claim. There is sufficient overlap between behavioural dispositions that we have good grounds for suggesting a commonality of mental states (so not dealing with complete openness of dispositions).

We should focus more broadly on behavioural dispositions than on individual pieces of behaviour, since all behavioural states are part of a more complex web, e.g. how I react to the snake is connected to other dispositions I hold.

<br>

### What is meant by the Asymmetry between Self-knowledge and of Knowledge of other people’s Mental States?

We are directly aware of our own mental states through introspection and self-consciousness, but can only infer the mental states of others from their behaviour. We cannot make mistakes about our own mental states, but we can make mistakes about the mental states of others.

</br>

### What Problem Does This Asymmetry Raise for Philosophical Behaviourism?

If mental states were dispositions to behaviour, then this would not be true. Saying ‘I am in pain’ would, under behaviourism, equate to me saying ‘My behaviour shows that I am in pain’. But surely this isn’t right? We experience our own mental states directly. Philosophical behaviourism denies an obvious asymmetry.

</br>

### Explain how Ryle Responds to this objection, with reference to a) Consciousness as a Myth; b) Consciousness as Awareness; and c) how Consciousness Provides Knowledge of My Own and others’ Mental States

##### Consciousness as a Myth

Ryle argues that consciousness (self-knowledge through introspection) is a myth. He says that self-knowledge and our knowledge of other minds are on par with each other, and therefore we can make reliable claims about our own behaviour or that of others. The difference is simply that there is more evidence available to ourselves than others.

##### Consciousness as Awareness

To be conscious, Ryle argues, is to be able and ready to say what we think or feel, and be unsurprised by the occurrence of said thought or feeling. Consciousness therefore provides the same kind of knowledge in cases of knowing our own mental states and knowing the mental states of others. The difference is that, in our own cases, we have more evidence, because we are able to use introspection, whilst we cannot use this in the case of other minds.

##### How consciousness provides knowledge of my own and others’ mental states

Knowing what you are thinking is no different in kind from knowing what another person is thinking - we can know just as directly what someone thinks when they speak, at least when they speak honestly (the most natural way to speak). When we speak like this, no matter to which audience, we are expressing our mental states. Close attention to what we say uncovers knowledge of the mind of whoever is talking. Introspection is no different, it is just the same concept applied to ourselves.

</br>

### Explain two possible objections to Ryle’s theory of consciousness

One possible objection is to ask whether thinking can be understood in terms of inner dialogue, and can that dialogue form the model for mental process in general? We are not saying anything to ourselves here.

A second possible objection is that Ryle misses out the subjective, experiential aspect of mental states and processes. Certain experiences have distinctive qualities, and these are central to our mental lives. I have an awareness of his aspect for my own mental states, but not for the mental states of others. The objection raised is that philosophical behaviourism cannot account for this aspect of self-knowledge, and the asymmetry between self-knowledge and knowledge of the mental states of others.

#### Revised

1) Understanding thinking as internalised speech does not accurately capture all types of thought, e.g. mood/feeling is not a behaviour as such - I feel happiness rather than speak it internally
2) Ryle neglects the subjective aspect of mental states, e.g. how it feels to be in pain is different from being aware of other people’s pain (this uses the verification principle - subjective experiences are meaningless since they can neither be verified empirically nor analytically) 

</br>

### Explain the claim that mental states cannot be completely capture by behaviour and behavioural dispositions

Behaviours associated with mental states don’t fully capture the mental state itself, e.g. ‘being in pain’ refers to behaviours such as wincing, crying, saying ‘I’m in pain’, etc., as well as ‘what it is like’ to feel pain (the essence of the mental state). Philosophical behaviourism fails to account for this satisfactorily.

Hempel’s response is that understanding mental states is tied up with behavioural states - we cannot talk meaningfully about mental states without reference to behaviour. However, an actor can convince us that they have one mental state whilst feeling another.

Ryle’s response consists of two arguments: 

a) we should consider physiological behaviours: brain connections and neural pathways are part of behaviour

b) Importance of dispositions: if this person was not acting, they would behave like $x$ (they are disposed to behave like this). Dispositions are relevant to specific contexts, e.g. a sugar cube has the disposition to only dissolve in water; an actor only has the disposition to feel pain in an instance when they have been physically harmed.

</br>

### 8

The counter-response to Ryle’s response is Putnam’s super-spartans - they are trained to suppress pain, so they do not express any behaviours associated with pain. Therefore there is nothing which always distinguishes certain behavioural states from others.

Hempel replies that mental states can be explained fully by a range of behaviours - only when we display *all* of them can we identify the mental state (e.g. mental illness). We therefore cannot meaningfully talk about mental states of super-spartans, since they are unable to meet all conditions for verification.
