# Substance Dualism

[[Philosophy/Glossary#Substance Dualism|Substance Dualism]] is the claim that mind and body are independent (but in this case closely linked) substances.

> [!tldr] Overview
> 
> - Mind and body exist as separate substances, mental and physical
> - Mind = *ontologically distinct* substance
> - Some empirical evidence, e.g. out of body experiences
> - Importance of the Cogito - mind without body is conceivable
> - Body = extension, is unthinking; mind = no extension, thinking

### The argument from indivisibility

1) The mind is something which cannot be divided into separate parts - it is on,e indivisible whole
2) The body is something which can be divided into separate parts
3) If two things share all the same properties, they must actually be one thing (this is Leibniz’s Law)
4) Mind and body do not share all the same properties
5) If one of the two things has any property that the other lacks, they must be distinct things (again, Leibniz's law)
6) The body has the property of divisibility, which the mind lacks
7) Mind and body must, therefore, be distinct things

> [!note] Leibniz's Law 
> 
> If A & B have all the same properties, then A = B. If A & B have any different properties, then A ≠ B
<br>

- Consciousness is singular in the individual, where the brain is not
- Consciousness (the mind) is indivisible but the brain (body) is not
- Mental states do not have extension, e.g. my belief that it is raining is triangular
- Beliefs etc. cannot be divided or referred to as physical states can
- Mental states/the mind are indivisible

#### Objections

- The mental is divisible in the same sense
- Mind is a property of the body - in that sense, they share the same properties
<br>

### The argument from conceivability

1) I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing
2) I have a clear and distinct idea of my body as a non-thinking, extended thing
3) If I can clearly and distinctly conceive of the essential nature of two things separately, it must be metaphysically possible to separate them
4) It is conceivable, and therefore possible, for the mind and body to be separated
5) Therefore the mind and body are two separate substances (if they were not, their separation would be inconceivable)

#### Objections

- What is metaphysically possible doesn’t tell us about reality. Possibility ≠ reality
- What is conceivable might not be metaphysically possible
- Too reliant on the success of clear and distinct ideas and the cogito

## Criticisms of Substance Dualism

> [!failure] Conceivability argument
> 
> #### Mind without body is not conceivable
> - It is not as clear and distinct as Descartes assumes that we can have mind without body, as Descartes recognises. It is possible to be confused or mistaken. Further, many of our mental states (e.g. fear or desire) are bound up with the physical
> <br>
> #### What is conceivable is not metaphysically possible
> - It is conceivable that water is XYZ, but not, in reality, possible since its properties would change if its chemical make up changed. 
> - *Masked Man Fallacy:* I can conceive of things which are not actually possible, e.g. i can conceive of the masked man as my father but equally know that it is not possible that he is not the masked man because he was with me at the time of the robbery. So whilst i can conceive of mind and body as separate substances, it does not follow that they are separate in reality
