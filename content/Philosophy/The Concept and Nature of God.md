# The Concept and Nature of God

</br>

### With Reference to Augustine, Outline the Two Ways that the Idea of God’s Perfection Has Been Linked to Reality

1) What is perfect is more real than what is imperfect, because imperfection involves something failing to exist in a better (i.e. more perfect) way. Hence Augustine’s understanding of the link between good and evil: evil as the lack/absence/privation of an original/perfect goodness (as darkness is the absence of light)

2) What is perfect is wholly self-sufficient: i.e. not dependent (or *contingent*) on the existence of anything else and as such it lacks nothing (its existence is necessary). God as the most perfect/self-sufficient being is thus understood as the ultimate reality

</br>

### Outline the Idea of God’s Omniscience, with Reference to Aquinas

It is important to bear in mind that if God is understood as the most perfect possible being then perhaps it is impossible for such a being to know everything (i.e. raises the question of the possible limits of God’s knowledge). For example, if humans have free will, is it possible for God to know what we will choose in the future? Thus, provisional definition: omniscience = knowing all that it is possible to know. Omniscience is not only a matter of *what* God knows but also *how* he knows it. 

For Aquinas, God’s perfection involves him knowing ‘directly’ rather than as the result of a cognitive process (i.e. God doesn’t need to work stuff out). The form of knowledge must match the object: e.g. we know visible objects best by means of sight. Moreover, direct knowledge of particulars is superior to knowledge mediated through concepts.

</br>

### Outline the Idea of God’s Omnipotence, with Reference to Aquinas

‘Power’ = ‘ability to act’, thus God’s omnipotence most obviously consists in the ability to do anything. But this requires development: as the most perfect possible being, God’s power may be limited to whatever it is possible to do. If God is thus limited, then God cannot be expected to what is logically impossible - to make 2 + 2 = 5; draw square triangles, etc.

Aquinas’ contribution to this is to insist on God’s omnipotence as being the capability to do whatever is possible. What is impossible is a contradiction in terms, and as such, meaningless. And what is self-contradictory and meaningless isn’t anything ‘real’ at all. So, the ‘limits’ of what is logically possible is not a true limitation on God’s power. 
</br>

### Outline the Idea of God’s Omnibenevolence, with Reference to the Distinction between ‘metaphysical’ and ‘moral’ Perfection

There are two ways of understanding omnibenevolence: 1) if goodness just is perfection, then to say ‘God is good’ is to say ‘God is perfectly perfect’ - i.e. the most perfect possible being. This is the metaphysical sense of goodness. 2) the moral sense of goodness: ‘God is perfectly good’ = ‘God always wills an act in accordance with moral values’. 

Plato and Augustine connect the two understandings of perfect goodness. What is perfect includes what is morally good; what is evil is associated with imperfection, with the lack/absence of goodness (Augustine: evil as the privation of good); evil as the failure to be good

The link to the metaphysical sense of goodness is that this lack of goodness in the moral sense equates to a lack of reality - goodness is more real than evil.

### What is the Difference between ‘everlasting’ and ‘eternal’?

God’s perfection implies that God is a necessary (not contingent) being and so not dependent on anything else to exist. As such, then nothing can bring God into existence or end God’s existence. Thus, God has no beginning or end. ‘Eternal’ and ‘everlasting’ express the two ways of understanding God as a being without beginning or end.

If God exists in time, i.e. God is a temporal being, then having no beginning or end, he exists throughout time.

If God exists outside of time, i.e. God is an atemporal being, then, having no beginning or end, he is timeless, specifically eternal.

N.B. this is a ‘negative’ definition in that it defines God as atemporal - i.e. not in time. It is not immediately obvious what it might mean to exist ‘outside’ of time. 
</br>

### Outline the Starting point of Stump and Kretzmann’s Discussion, Namely Boethius

‘The complete possession all at one of illimitable life’ –> i.e. life possessed in its ‘whole fullness’ –> ‘such that nothing future is absent from it and nothing past has flowed away’. Instead, God’s external nature. 

In ‘On the Trinity’, Boethius defines God’s eternity in terms of ‘now’: for an eternal being, ‘now’ remains and does not move, instead marking out the entire eternal life of the being.

The difference between a temporal sense of ‘now’ a) and the atemporal sense of ‘now’, bi) temporal = ‘now’ as the current moment marking the passage of time between past and future, bii) atemporal = ‘now’ as marking out the eternal life of God. 

</br>

### What Are the Differences between the Temporal Sense of ‘now’ and the Eternal Sense of ‘now’?

We can say that an eternal being: 

- Has ‘life’ (psychological rather than physical)
- Cannot have a beginning or end, i.e. is illimitable
- Is temporal - i.e. a unique meaning to ‘now’
- Involves a unique type of duration, as no part/aspect of it is ever absent

</br>

### Explain Boethius’ Circle as an account of God’s Eternity

We cannot show an eternal being on a linear timeline, because such a being never exists at a single point in time. Instead, Boethius suggests a circle in which the whole of time is presented by the circumference of the circle, with God as the centre point. As such, God is simultaneous with every point in time.

But what do we mean by simultaneity? Not the same as ‘Descartes, Locke, and Liebniz lived simultaneously’, since an eternal being is simultaneous with every point in time (Descartes, Locke, and Liebniz lived simultaneously for only a limited number of points in time). So, we can’t say that God exists at the same time as events $x$ and $y$ since God does not exist in time (i.e. he is atemporal). So, what does God’s simultaneity mean?

</br>

### Outline Stump and Kretzmann’s Two New Concepts of Simultaneity

1) Temporal simultaneity (T-Simultaneity) - Two things are simultaneous if they exist/occur at one and the same point in time. N.B. this presupposes that the ‘things’ exist in time.

2) Eternal simultaneity (E-Simultaneity) - God’s whole ‘life’ is present to God. Two events/beings are e-simultaneous if they exist/occur in one and the same eternal present. Any two events in God’s life are simultaneous since all events in God’s life are present in an eternal now.

N.B. These two concepts of simultaneity map onto the two concepts of ‘now’.

</br>

### Explain What, according to Stump and Kretzmann’s Account, it means to Say that You and God Exist ET-Simultaneously

Stump and Kretzmann use these two concepts of simultaneity to create a third concept to relationship of an eternal being and time: ET-simultaneity. ET-simultaneity (simultaneity between something eternal and something temporal, e.g. God and Annie-May). We cannot say that the two things exist at the same time, since God is atemporal, nor can we say they exist in an eternal present since one of them is temporal.

What does it mean to say that we (created temporal beings) and God (atemporal being) exist ‘ET-simultaneously’? Stump and Kretzmann explain: God’s knowledge is not in time - every temporal event is present to God - it is ET-simultaneous with God’s knowledge of it, as a result of which God does not know of events before they happen (instead His knowledge is ET-simultaneous with the event). 

The formal definition of ET-simultaneity is that where $x$ stands for ‘a temporal event’ and $y$ stands for ‘an eternal event’, $x$ and $y$ are ET-simultaneous if a) for an eternal being (God) $x$ and $y$ are both present, $x$ observed as temporally present and $y$ as eternally present, and b) for a temporal being, $x$ and $y$ are both present , $x$ observed as temporally present and $y$ as eternally present.

Because the former being is temporal, and God is eternal, it is mistaken to say that God and the being exist at the same time.

In short, the being and God don’t exist T-simultaneously (though two temporal beings do). Similarly, the temporal being does not exist eternally, so they and God do not exist E-simultaneously.

</br>

### Outline Stump and Kretzmann’s Idea of God’s Existence as a Special Type of Duration (atemporal duration)


Temporal duration: we only exist in a given moment (the ‘now’) while the past describes ‘now’ moments that no longer exists and the future describes ‘now’ moments that have yet to exist. So, our existence is existence in the temporal present, which is always becoming the past as it enters the future.

Atemporal duration: God’s existence, by contrast, is a type of duration in which no part of existence becomes past or has yet to come into existence - all is present: God is present to himself. This is atemporal duration as Boethius and, following him, Stump and Kretzmann understand it - all that God ‘was’ or ‘will be’, God already is.

## The Paradox of the Stone
### Outline the Paradox of the Stone

Can God, in his omnipotence, create a stone that is too heavy for him to lift? If yes, then there would appear to be a limit on his power (i.e. something he cannot do). And if there is something he cannot do, then he is not omnipotent - the reason being that omnipotence is an incoherent concept: no being could have the power to create a stone it can’t lift and to lift it.

</br>

### Explain the Reply according to Which the Paradox Fails by Presupposing the Possibility of Something Logically Impossible

The paradox presupposes the possibility of something logically impossible. The claim that X can make something too heavy for X to lift is not a self-contradiction. But it becomes self-contradictory when x is omnipotent - a stone that an omnipotent being cannot lift is incoherent because no being could have the power to create a stone it can’t lift and to lift that stone. So the paradox is resolved - God does not lack a possible power.

The reply presupposes that it is coherent to speak of an omnipotent being - the reply might be said to beg the question - the question being ‘is it coherent to talk about an omnipotent being?’ (i.e. the reply presupposes the conclusion it is trying to reach).

</br>

### Explain the Reply according to Which the Paradox Fails because there is no Stone that God can’t Create

Suppose that God *can* lift any stone but can’t *create* a stone that he cannot lift. If so, “God cannot create a stone he cannot lift” simply means “If God can create a stone then he can lift it”. So there is no stone God can create but not lift - just as He can create any stone, so He can lift any stone. In short, God lacks no power related to either the creation or lifting of stones.

</br>

## The Euthyphro Dilemma
### Explain the Difference between Claiming that God Wills what is Morally Right because it is Right and Claiming that what is Morally Right is Right because God Wills it


#### The Claim that God Wills what is Morally Right because it is Right

To be good, God’s will conforms with a standard of goodness that is independent of God. His omnipotence consists in God always adhering to this standard (i.e. by his nature).

#### The Claim that what is Morally Right is Right because God Wills it

What is good becomes good on account that it is willed by God. Morality is whatever God wills.

</br>

There are reasons to think that both statements are problematic:

1) If true, they place a constraint on God: God is restricted to willing what conforms with an independent standard of goodness; also this makes God’s goodness dependent on that standard, begging the question of the origin of this independent standard (who created it?)
2) Because God can change what is wrong to what is right by an act of willing - this seems at odds with our view of the moral good, which implies consistency. Yet this options suggests that if God commanded the killing of children, then killing children would become good.

N.B. if these are the only alternatives and if they are both seriously problematic the we have reason to consider whether our concept of God as omnibenevolent is coherent.

</br>

### Outline Euthyphro’s Struggle to Define Piety

In Plato’s dialogue (between Socrates and Euthyphro), Socrates asks: is Piety doing what the Gods demand, or do the Gods demand piety from us? Euthyphro’s first answer: the Gods love what is pious because it is pious. Socrates’ reply in effect rejects this. He says that what the Gods value is valued because they value it, it is not valued by them because the recognise an independent standard of value (not ‘loved by them because it is dear to them’).

Socrates doesn’t support this rejection with any specific arguments - Socrates rests on the basic thought that what the Gods value is valued simply because they value it.

</br>

### Explain the Debate over whether Morality Depends on what God Wills

God cannot turn good into evil or evil into good, but this is no limitation on God’s power because it is logically impossible for good to be anything other than itself. Thus, even if God commanded an immoral action, the command itself would not make the action right (because such an action cannot be right.

The problem lies with the claim of ‘logical impossibility’. There is nothing self-contradictory about statements such as ‘torturing babies is right’ (it is not analytically true/false). And so we might ask why an omnipotent being cannot make such a statement true (since it depends on the way the world is, and an omnipotent being can change the way the world is - to not be able to do so would be a limit on His power).

Nothing that exists is independent of an omnipotent creator God who creates ex nihilo (out of nothing) so God’s omnipotence requires us to reject option 1.

</br>

### Explain the Debate over whether Morality Depends on God

The initial objection is that option 2 implies that if God commanded killing babies it would become moral - but we would think that this is wrong. Further, if ‘good’ is defined as ‘whatever God wills’ then ‘God is good’ says very little about the nature of God. God’s will is ‘good’ by definition - God wills whatever God wills - a tautology because because ‘God is goodness’ is the same as ‘God wills’ - the idea of God’s goodness is drained of specific meaning. Further to this, if ‘good’ is ‘whatever God wills’, then morality becomes arbitrary - there is no moral reason guiding God’s will as he invents morality (God is a bit ‘random’).

Key point: if what is good is good because God wills it then in the example of killing babies any facts about the suffering of children are irrelevant to one act of God’s will in comparison to another. But if God has no reasons to will what He wills, then morality has no rational structure and God’s will is arbitrary. This conclusion takes us back to option 1: there must be an independent standard of morality. But we have seen that this is deeply problematic - which leaves us in a state of incoherence.

</br>

### Explain the Reply to the Dilemma according to Which although God’s Will Does not Respond to Anything Independent of It, it is not Arbitrary

Is there any escape from this incoherence? Possibly: although God’s will does not respond to anything independent of it as per option 1), it is not arbitrary (as per option 2). N.B. this response refuses the dichotomy of the original dilemma, suggesting an ‘option 3’!

This response involves reference to God’s other attributes, most obviously God’s *love*. The argument is that God’s will is structured by God’s love, and this creates morality. God wills what He wills because He loves (the ‘because’ provides the rationale).

We might yet ask: but why (i.e. for what reason?) does God love what he loves? Is what he loves arbitrary? (If there is no response to this then we once again have an arbitrary God).

One possible response: is it possible for God to love something different? If we suppose that God loves reality as a whole then there is nothing that God doesn’t love. In other words, given God’s nature (as a God of love) could God act differently? If we cannot form a clear idea of God loving differently and still being God, then the lingering objection (i.e. why does God love what he loves?) fades away.

</br>

### Explain the Development of the above Reply that Draws a Distinction between ‘concepts’ and ‘properties’, Leading to the Claim that what is Good is Identical with what God Wills, yet ‘God is good’ is not a Tautology

The development of this third option distinguishes between ‘concepts’ and ‘properties’ to explain how morality is what God wills but that ‘God is good’ is not a tautology. The key point is that ‘God’ and ‘morally good’ are different concepts: ‘goodness is what God wills’ is not an analytic truth: At the same time, ‘goodness’ *is* the same property as ‘what God wills’.

The parallel case is ‘water’ and ‘H<sup>2</sup>0’ are different concepts (before the discovery of hydrogen and oxygen humans nonetheless knew about ‘water’). Thus, ‘water is H<sup>2</sup>0’ is not analytically true. At the same time, ‘water’ and ‘H<sup>2</sup>0’ do possess the same properties - they are identical. 

Likewise, ‘good’ and ‘what God wills’ are different concepts (and as such are analytically true - people have separated the concepts of ‘God’ and ‘goodness’).

Morality is dependent on God - this is a metaphysical truth (i.e. about the nature of reality) but not a conceptual truth about morality. But: how can we provide that ‘goodness’ and ‘what God wills’ are the same thing unless we have an independent standard of goodness to ‘test’ the matter?

This is an issue, but only applies to how we know what is good, not what goodness turns out to be (‘in reality’) (in other words, epistemologically but not metaphysically).

In terms of what we can know, we may conclude that our understanding of God’s will is the best source of knowledge about what is good (in the Judaeo-Christian context this understanding will focus on God as a God of love)


</br>

## The Compatibility of God’s Omniscience and Human Free Will

### Summarise the argument that if God knows my future actions, then my actions are not free

If God knows my future actions, then those actions are not free:

P1: For an action to be free it must be an action that the agent can refrain from
P2: If God knows how the agent will act before the agent acts, then it is true that the agent will perform that act
C1: Therefore it cannot be true that god knows what the agent will do before the agent does it and be true that the agent doesn’t commit the action (i..e the two are mutually exclusive).
P3: If true that the agent will commit the act then there is nothing the agent can do to prevent it from being the case
C2: Therefore, if God knows what the agent will do before it is done, then the agent cannot refrain from the action in the future
C3: If God knows the action before the agent commits the action, then the agent is not free

N.B. the argument does not say ‘humans are not free’, it claims that if God knows what we will do before we do it, then we are not free. We can also argue the contrary: if we *are* free, then the argument entails that God doesn’t know what we will do before we do it, and so there is something God doesn’t know, and so He isn’t omniscient (i.e. ‘human free will’ and ‘God’s omniscience’ are logically incompatible/mutually exclusive).

We might seek to resolve the contradiction by foregoing the idea of free will (whilst maintaining God’s omniscience). But the immediate problem with this is that it might be said to contradict God’s omnibenevolence - specifically, an omnibenevolent God would will that our lives are morally significant (choices, opportunities to grow spiritually, etc.) and this is only possible if we have free will (Kant would offer a version of this argument: that moral significance presupposes free will).

</br>

### Explain the response to this dilemma based on the claim that God is not eternal, but everlasting

If everlasting it is not a limitation on God’s omniscience if He does not know the future. If we have free will then our choices are futural - yet to made, and so impossible for an everlasting God to know ‘in advance’. God’s omniscience consists in knowing all that it is possible to know at a given time. 

We might object a) that this is an unsatisfactory view of God’s omniscience (it presents a God for whom the future is as unknown as it is for humans); b) that this is an unsatisfactory account of the God-time relation (see earlier notes). 

</br>

### Explain the response to this dilemma based on the claim that God’s foreknowledge is compatible with freewill

God knows what we will do in advance, but this does not preclude free will: while it is true that $x$ will commit action $y$, it does not follow that it *must* be true that $x$ will commit action $y$ (i.e. what is contingent - $x$'s choice - is not necessarily true). E.g. we know many contingent truths such as “Athens is the capital of Greece” - but just because it is true at the moment does not mean that it must be true (the capital was originally Patras).

Likewise, for God to know what i will do in the future, it only requires that I don’t do something else - it doesn’t mean that i can't (my choices are contingent). Some God can know what I will do and I can still do what I do freely, and thus God’s omniscience is compatible with free will. In short, God knows what I will freely choose.

The reply to this is that the statement ‘God knows what I will freely choose’ is problematic because if I can refrain from what God knows I will do, then I can change what God knows. Yet it seems God already knows what I will do, and so changing my mind means changing the past.

But how is it that God knows what I will do? Ordinarily, we might say that we know what Hector will do by induction: as a kind person, and because whenever in the past he has met an old lady he has helped her acorss the road, we might infer by induction that he will now help an old lady across the road, making a prediction. This is knowledge (justified, true, and a belief) but it does not preclude his free will. But we can’t suppose that God’s knowledge of what Hector will do is of a similar type: inductive knowledge is reliable, whereas God’s knowledge is infallible and complete, and such knowledge - the objection continues - implies that Hector’s choice is in some sense determined and so not free.

</br>

### Explain the response to this dilemma based on the claim that the discussion thus far has misunderstood what it is for God to be eternal, with reference to Stump and Kretzmann’s claim that God’s knowledge of what we do is ET-simultaneous with our doing it

Stump and Kretzmann’s key point is that if God’s knowledge is eternal then it is not in time. Every agent (including Hector) and every event is present to God, that is, ET-simultaneous with God’s knowledge of it, and so God does not know anything ‘before’ it happens. In talking about God knowing what we will do before we do it, P2 in the original argument (see Q.10) supposes that God’s knowledge is in tie/ But he can’t know what we will do beforehand, because God’s knowledge is not ‘before’ anything - it is atemporal: ET-simultaneous.
