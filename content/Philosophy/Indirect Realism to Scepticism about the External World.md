# Indirect Realism to Scepticism about the External World

</br>

Russel: the existence of the external world is the best hypothesis.

Locke: We cannot avoid certain sense-data, I can only choose when I experience, e.g. closing my eyes stops certain sense-data. I am currently perceiving my philosophy class and it is clear that this is involuntary - if I could choose my perceptions, I would be perceiving a tropical island in the sun.

Locke and Trotter Cockburn: Our perceptions are coherent with each other, e.g. I hear the train coming, then I see it, etc. - this coherence suggests an external source of these properties
