# Berkley's Master Argument and Criticism
</br>

## Master Argument

</br>

Hylas (Realist): 'What more easy than to conceive a tree... unperceived by any mind' (i.e. I can conceive of a tree which is independent)

However, Hylas is actually perceiving the tree by conceiving of it - so it is impossible to conceive of a mind-independent object, since all object are ideas in the mind.

Idealism = All objects are mind-dependent
+
Empiricism = We can only know what we experience

Therefore: 'I am thinking of a tree = I have the idea of a tree' = 'There is a (mind-dependent) tree'
</br>

## Russel's Criticism

Thinking is mind-dpendent, but it does not follow that the thing that is being thought about is mind-dependent

'In our mind' is an ambiguous phrase which can mean different things, e.g. memory, sympathy, what is in front of me/concentration. Berkley uses all three in his master argument, and fails to distinguish between them.
