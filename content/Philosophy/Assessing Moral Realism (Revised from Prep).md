### What is Ayer’s ‘[[Philosophy/Glossary#verification principle|verification principle]]’?

The verification principle states that a statement only has meaning if it is either analytic or empirically verifiable. If an [[Philosophy/Glossary#Analytical truth|analytic]] statement is empirically verifiable - that is, if empirical evidence would go towards establishing that the statement is true or false - then it is verifiable. A statement is verifiable as long as we *know* how to prove it - no actual proof is required. Additionally, we don’t need to be able to proof that a claim is empirically verifiable. It is enough that empirical evidence raises or reduces the probability that a statement is true. This principle can be understood as a development of Hume’s Fork.

### Explain Ayer’s objection to moral naturalism and non-naturalism

Empirical investigation cannot prove non-analytical statements such as ‘murder is wrong’ or ‘pleasure is good’ to be true or false. The open question argument shows that it is never a contradiction to say ‘$x$ would cause unhappiness, but it is right to do it nonetheless. Thus, Ayer agrees that moral naturalism is wrong.

### Explain the argument that the verification principle cannot be the right account of meaning as it is self-defeating

The verification principle undermines itself: statements are meaningful (possess truth value) only if they are analytic or empirically verifiable. And yet the verification principle is neither analytic nor empirically verifiable. 

Ayer’s reply? The verification principle is intended as a definition and not an empirical hypothesis about meaning. Is this a reasonable defence of his position? We might allow Ayer’s separation of the verification principle as a ‘definition’ (and so not self-undermining), but the problem remains that, as a definition, it is only as convincing as the other arguments used to support Ayer’s claim that it is the right definition of what is ‘meaningful’.

Notably, there are reasons to suppose that the verification principle offers a too restrictive definition of ‘meaningful’ - first, Moore would challenge it via intuitionism. Second - and more generally - there are many possible statements (‘I love you’) which are meaningful but neither analytic nor verifiable. Thus, we might argue that Ayer’s ‘definition’ is simply wrong.

### What is Hume’s Fork?

There are two types of judgements of reason/cognitive judgements: ‘relations of ideas’ (discovered by thought/reflection - analytic) and ‘matters of fact’ (claims about the external world, established by sense experiences - synthetic).

</br>

### Explain the objection to moral cognitivism based on Hume’s fork

Based on the fork, Hume makes the following criticism of moral cognitivism (and thus moral realism): as there are only two types of  judgements of reason and moral judgements belong to neither of these types, then moral judgements are not judgements of reason (instead they are non-cognitive expressions of feelings/attitudes)

To answer Hume’s criticism, the moral cognitivist/realist has to either reject Hume’s fork (i.e. the claim that there are only two types of judgements of reason) or give examples of moral judgements that are matters of fact/relations of ideas.

Moore takes option 1: he rejects the fork and argues that there is another type of judgement of reason, namely moral intuitions, which are synthetic propositions that are self-evident (and so not empirically verifiable in the normal way).
</br>

### Explain one theory claiming that moral judgements are judgements of reason (as a response to the challenge from Hume’s fork to moral realism) 

Mill takes option 2: Moral judgements of reason *are* matters of fact: this is effectively what the proof of utilitarianism is seeking to show: namely, that pleasure is good and pain is bad.

### Explain Hume’s argument from motivation against cognitivism 

Hume’s argument from motivation against moral cognitivism contends that: 

P1: Moral judgements can motivate actions
P2: Reason cannot motivate action
∴ : Moral judgements are not judgements of reason (so Moral Realism fails and we need to become non-cognitivists).

Thus, Hume argues that we are always motivated by emotions and desires (i.e. the source of our motivation is non-cognitive). As such, these motivations are not psychological states that can be true or false. Emotions/desires have a ‘world to mind’ direction of fit - i.e. they seek to change the world to fit the individual’s emotional desires.

### How might the moral realist respond to Hume’s argument from motivation? 

The moral realist might: 

i) criticise P1: Contest Hume’s claim that moral judgements motivate actions - by doing good actions we must also have the desire to do good. In saying that moral judgements don’t motivate us there is no reason to conclude that moral judgements aren’t judgements of reason

ii) criticise P2: There *are* some judgements of reason that can motivate us, contrary to Hume’s claim - however, it is difficult to locate examples of such judgements and so difficult to substantiate the initial criticism (since Moral Realism claims that moral judgements are matters of fact)

</br>

### Explain Hume’s claim that there is a ‘gap’ between *ought* and *is* as an objection to cognitivism

Hume argues that moral ‘ought’ statements are completely separate to factual ‘is’ statements. In other words, there is a gap between them that means it is impossible to establish any necessary link between the one and the other (i.e. between ‘is’ and ‘ought’)

Key Point: This operates as an objection to cognitivism because of what Hume is saying about how moral arguments work. Take the example “eating animals causes suffering, therefore we ought not to eat meat”. In cognitive terms, the conclusion states a moral truth that is inferred from the premise, an ‘ought’ (not to eat meat) inferred from an ‘is’ (the fact that eating meat causes animal suffering). Hume contends that this type of inference (‘is’ to ‘ought’) is invalid. If moral judgements were true or false then we would be able to infer them from ‘is’ claims. But we can’t. This is a reason to think that moral judgements aren’t truth claims and so cognitivism is false.

### Explain why moral disagreement on its own doesn't disprove moral realism

The descriptive fact that different societies have different moral codes does not in itself establish that there are no objective moral facts. It may be that there are such moral facts, and some have discovered those facts whilst others remain in error.

### Explain the objection to moral realism from moral relativity

The moral realist argues that different societies, with their different moral values and practices, are all in search of objective moral truth. By contrast, the moral relativist argues that this is not the case: rather, the moral values and practices of different societies reflect different ways of life. 

Whilst we might explain different perceptions on scientific matters in terms of access/awareness of the latest empirical evidence, this is not obviously the way to explain moral disagreements. Rather, such disagreement is better explained in terms of different ways of life giving rise to different moral belief systems. This is the moral relativist argument.

The realist reply to this is that the relativist argument exaggerates the difference between different moral value systems: rather, there are general ethical principles found at the core of all value systems, e.g. prohibitions on killing, theft, adultery, etc.

So, Mackie argues, if the difference between moral systems is evidence for the non-existence of objective moral facts, it is also evidence *for* such facts in the agreement to be seen in shared ‘general’ principles.

But Mackie thinks this defence if moral realism is ultimately weak: at best it only shows that fundamental principles are objective, but that actual principles (i.e. how the ‘general’ principles are applied) are relative to particular circumstances. Precisely which actions arouse people’s moral disapproval change from one society to another. 

### Does Mackie’s argument from relativity show that moral realism is false (with the reference to two possible responses)?

The moral realist defence against Mackie is as follows:

1) We might argue that moral realism is not seeking to explain why people have the moral values they hold - which is what sociology seeks to explain - rather it is trying to explain the nature of moral judgements themselves

	The person who would make this response to Mackie is Moore. Moore’s account of moral intuitions is not an account of ‘gut reactions’ (or such like). Instead, Moore is concerned with rational ‘self-evident’ synthetic moral propositions. Moore argues that we only have moral intuitions about fundamental moral principles, and intuitionism must not b confused with moral feelings, however strong they may be. In short, if Mackie is seeking to undermine Intuitionism with his criticism then he misunderstands intuition (i.e. Mackie treats intuitions - which are strictly cognitive - as though they were little different to strong moral feelings)

</br>

2) Mackie claims that any moral judgements that are relative are therefore not objective . The moral realist might object that this completely misunderstands the idea of ‘moral reality’. For example, “chilli plants grow well” is a relative truth (i.e. true in some contexts, untrue in others). But this does not make it any less objective. Whether or not the chilli plant will grow well is an objective mind-independent fact.

	The point is that moral realists can say the same of moral statements: some ethical practices will be legitimate in some but not other contexts. So, ‘killing is wrong’ might be true in circumstance A but not circumstance B. That does not mean they can’t both be objectively correct (just as ‘chillies don’t grow well’ is objectively true in Greenland and ‘chillies grow well’ is objectively time in Chile).

</br>

### Explain Mackie’s argument from metaphysical queerness 

This is Mackie’s most notable argument against moral realism. In short, the argument contends that the oddity (i.e. queerness) of moral properties and how we would know about them (if they existed) makes it implausible to think that there are any moral properties.

There are two aspects to this ‘queerness’: metaphysical and epistemological

Metaphysical queerness claims that moral properties possess a motivational aspect that doesn’t exist in any other natural property. Moral judgements motivate us. But if that’s so, simply knowing what is good would of itself be enough to motivate us to act in certain ways. But this is an odd idea - which is precisely Mackie’s point. How could an objective property motivate us? More specifically, how can there be a direct link between a fact about the world and our desires? Knowledge does not entail motivation: the ‘direction of fit’ is wrong. In short, the concept of objective moral properties is weird, Mackie says.

### Explain Mackie’s argument from epistemological queerness 

What is more, objective moral properties are also epistemologically queer. So, even if there were objective moral properties (i.e. even if objective moral properties weren’t metaphysically queer), there would remain the question of how we could known them (i.e. their epistemological queerness). Intuitionism thinks it has an answer to this - i.e. we know objective moral facts intuitively. But this is a terrible answer, Mackie says, because it does not tell us anything other than that we have a ‘special faculty for understanding morality’ - which is no philosophical answer at all.
</br>

### Does Mackie show that moral properties don’t exist? 

Mackie’s arguments from queerness depend on agreeing with his understanding of what moral realism claims. Mackie supposes that moral realism is committed to the thesis that moral properties are mind-independent and part of reality. 

And yet, ‘reality’ cannot simply mean ‘physical reality’ - moral properties, if they exist, aren’t going to be ‘just like’ physical properties. But - are psychological properties ‘part of reality’? They certainly ‘exist’ - whether Mrs Fairley is angry or not is a psychological fact. In one sense, this is not a mind-independent fact as it is a fact about a mind. In another sense, it is mind-independent because whether Mrs Fairley is happy does not depend on what others think.

Moral Realism argues that moral judgements are mind-independent to the extent that their truth/falsity does not depend on what we happen to think is the case. But it doesn’t have to argue that moral judgements are not about minds. So, (responding to Mackie) if moral facts are facts about our minds, perhaps they aren’t so ‘queer’ after all. Reductive non-naturalism pursues this thought further. Take the example of Utilitarianism: Mill’s point is that experience does give us evidence of what is good: the best evidence for what is desirable is that we observe people desiring if (i.e. pleasure). Once this is recognised, the reductive naturalist suggests, epistemological queerness is addressed. As to metaphysical queerness: if goodness is happiness, then there is no queerness because it is simply a natural psychological property and one that motivates (as we can observe). 

N.B. These responses (to Mackie) are driven by (reductive and non-reductive) moral naturalism, arguing that moral properties aren’t ‘queer’ because they fit with our understanding (based on observation) of human life.
