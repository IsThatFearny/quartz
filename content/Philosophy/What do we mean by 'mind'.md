# What do we mean by 'mind'?

Minds: Point of view, perspective, e.g. I can make sense of and rationalise my experiences whereas a sea cucumber does not (apparently)

Non-Minds: lacks subjectivity of experience - sense of my place in relation to the world

Pain, coffee smell, chocolate

Qualia have just a subject, not a subject and an object

Qualia are properties of consciousness, and therefore they are also properties that we are consciously aware of

Other things can have the same smell as coffee
