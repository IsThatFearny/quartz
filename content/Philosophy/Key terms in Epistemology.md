### A priori, a posteriori, analytic and synthetic statements
As we can see in the above spider diagram, statements such as 1 + 1 = 2 is 'A Priori', and can be known prior to sense experience, while the statement 'I have Arms' is 'A posteriori', and can be known after or from experience

1+1 = 2 is also an analytical truth, which is true by definition, and in all possible worlds. 'I have arms' is a Synthetic Truth, which means that it is true because of how the world is and could be different in other possible worlds

A priori and A posteriori are ways of knowledge, and analytic and synthetic are types of statement

Empiricists claim that we only know synthetic statements A posteriori
Translation: Knowledge of the world can only be gained by experience

However, rationalists would disagree with this, instead arguing that we can know some synthetic statements a priori
Translation: We can know things about the world without experience
