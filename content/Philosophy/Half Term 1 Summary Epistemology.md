# Half Term 1 Summary
</br>

## [[Key terms in Epistemology|A priori, A posteriori, analytical and synthetic truths]]
</br>
A Priori: Can be known <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">prior to sense experience</mark>, e.g. 1+1 = 2

A Posteriori: Can only be known <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">after sense experience</mark>, e.g. 'I have arms'

Analytical Statement: True by definition, and in all possible worlds

Synthetic Statement: True because of how the world is, could be different in other possible worlds

Empiricism claims that we can only know synthetic statements A Posteriori, but rationalists disagree, arguing that some synthetic statements can be known A Priori.

</br>

## [[What is Knowledge (Revised from Prep)|What is Knowledge?]]
</br>
Ability Knowledge: Something that we have <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">learnt how to do</mark>, e.g. riding a bike.. Subconscious, hard to articulate

Acquaintance Knowledge: Knowledge that is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">gained through experience</mark> and becoming acquainted to something, e.g. knowing a place or a person
</br>
Proposition: What is expressed by a declarative statement

Propositional knowledge: Knowledge that we know to be true or false, even without any prior experience for justification, e.g. mathematical knowledge
</br>
Acquaintance and ability knowledge <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">cannot be true or false</mark>, and therefore cannot involve propositions. There is no degree of truthfulness, it just *is*
</br>

Belief: Thought about the world; we do not know for sure but we persistently agree on, a claim whether true or false  

Proposition: A statement about how something in the world is; can be true or false  

Fact: Something that has been <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">proven to be true through empirical evidence</mark> and is generally indisputable; Cannot be true or false  

Truth: Alignment of facts and beliefs; <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">correct in accordance to perception of reality</mark>
</br>

## [[Are the JTB conditions jointly sufficient|Conditions]]
</br>

Conditional Statement: Relate the truth of x/y

Necessary condition: A condition which <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">must be present </mark>for a definition to be accurate

Sufficient Condition: A condition which <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">fulfils the criteria for a definition</mark> without need for further conditions

</br>

Necessary and sufficient conditions are useful for providing definitions in terms of something else, e.g. Defining a bachelor in terms of being an unmarried man
</br>

A good definition <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">should not be circular</mark> and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">should not use the concept that is being defined</mark>. If a definition can be positive, it <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">should not be negative</mark>. A good definition should also be<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> informative</mark> and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">avoid counterexamples</mark>
</br>

## [[Conditions (Truth, Justification, Belief)|JTB Conditions]]
</br>

### Truth Condition

For something to be classed as knowledge, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">it must be true</mark>. If a proposition is false, then it is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">merely a belief</mark>.

The understanding of truth is contested. Two main theories prevail: 

Correspondence Theory: Correspondence between <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">truth and objective reality
</mark>

Coherence theory: A belief is true if it is part of a '<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">web of beliefs</mark>' held by society to be true. Allows truth to be objectively false, relies upon other beliefs. Allows people in different time periods to 'know'

</br>

### Justification Condition

A claim without the ability to justify by means of evidence is simply an <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">unsubstantiated assertion</mark>. An unjustified true belief is not knowledge (e.g. racist juror). Justification criteria are required to distinguish knowledge from a guess/estimate/luck
</br>

### Belief Condition

You cannot know something without also believing it.

There is an argument to say that <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">knowledge and belief are incompatible</mark>, as knowledge is infallible and belief is fallible. However, this is based upon acquaintance knowledge, and it would seem that knowledge is unconscious - belief operates at a more conscious level.

</br>

## Gettier Cases

1.  Smith and Jones apply for the same job
2.  Smith knows that Jones has 10 coins in his pocket
3.  The boss tells Smith that Jones will get the job
4.  Smith therefore comes to the conclusion that 'the man with 10 coins in his pocket will get the job'
5.  Unbeknownst to Smith, he also has 10 coins in his pocket
6.  Smith gets the job

In this scenario, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">all conditions hold</mark>, yet Smith doesn't have knowledge.

</br>

## [[Can Gettier Cases be Overcome (Revised from Prep)|Overcoming Gettier Cases]]
</br>

### [[Can Gettier Cases be Overcome (Revised from Prep)#What is the 'no false lemmas' condition and how does it deal with Gettier's 'Smith and Jones' example?|No False Lemmas]]

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">S did not infer P from a false belief</mark>. 'Jones will get the job' is a false lemma (claim made part way through an argument. When NFL is used, the inference that Smith has made <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">no longer satisfies the conditions for knowledge.</mark>

Zagzebski raises the concern that there are Gettier Cases that satisfy the 'no false lemmas' condition without the person having knowledge, e.g. Dr Jones and the Patient. Dr Jones studies the symptoms of and runs tests on her patient, and diagnoses him with having Virus X. No other known virus produces these test results or symptoms, and therefore Dr Jones has belief and justification that her patient has Virus X. Unbeknownst to her however, the symptoms and test results are actually a result of Virus Y. However, we know that the patient has just contracted Virus X, yet no symptoms or test results show this. This example satisfies all conditions for knowledge, including no false lemmas. P is true, justified, believed, and is not inferred from a false belief. And yet <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Dr Jones does not have knowledge.
</mark>
</br>

### [[Can Gettier Cases be Overcome (Revised from Prep)#How would an infallibilist approach to knowledge avoid Gettier cases altogether?|Infallibilism]]

Gettier makes the assumption that Smith's beliefs are justified. However, it can be argued that Smith's reasons are <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">not sufficient for justification</mark>.

Infallibilism avoids Gettier Cases altogether by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">bridging the gap between truth and knowledge,</mark> making it near impossible for justification to exist without certainty or truth.

However, it is rare justification rules out any <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">possible errors</mark>, and infallibilism entails that <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">we have very little knowledge</mark>. Knowledge is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">more than just certainty</mark>. In addition, infallibilism does not seem to contrast between the statements 'S is not mistaken' and 'S cannot possibly be mistaken'. It therefore commits the<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">fallacy of equivocation</mark>.
</br>

### [[Can Gettier Cases be Overcome (Revised from Prep)#Explain the reliabilist approach to knowledge, with reference to how it deals with the problem of justification and how it attempts to overcome Gettier style counter-examples|Reliabilism]]

Reliabilism claims that S knows P IFF
- P is true
- S believes that P, and
- S's belief is produced by a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">reliable cognitive process</mark>

Reliable Cognitive Process: A cognitive process which produces a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">high percentage of true beliefs</mark>, e.g. perception or  memory.

Reliabilism attemps to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">strengthen the definition of justification</mark> (instead of making it infallible). This overcomes issues where a mistake in a cognitive process accidentally produces knowledge. It also <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">allows young children and animals to have knowledge</mark>. Whether they have justification is irrelevant, as long as they have formed their beliefs through a reliable cognitive process.

The reliabilist understands knowledge as a '<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">natural good</mark>' similar to beauty or strength, as it bestows benefits on the creature which possesses it.

However, it can be argued that Reliabilism <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">cannot respond to all gettier counterexamples</mark> - Fake barn County, Dr Jones and the virus

</br>

### [[Can Gettier Cases be Overcome (Revised from Prep)#Explain Zagzebski's argument that no analysis of knowledge that merely adds conditions to true beliefs can escape Gettier cases|Zagzebski's counter to third conditions]]

Zagzebski says that as long as the third condition (No false lemmas, reliable process, etc.) is independent of truth, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">we will always be able to construct Gettier examples</mark> that show that this definition of knowledge is incorrect. Zagzebski argues that in a 'good' definition of knowledge, we must demonstrate how truth and the third condition are connected, and not just added on to each other. This connection must have something to do with why knowledge is good in a way that true belief is not
</br>

### [[Truth Tracking]]

S knows that P IFF
- P is true
- S believes that P
- If P were not true, S would not believe that P
- If P were true, S would believe that P

The statement that 'If P were not true, S would not believe that P' is a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">counterfactual</mark>, a statement about how things would be in a different world

e.g. Dodgy Zoo vs Honest Zoo  
In this circumstance, the honest zoo has real zebras, and the dodgy zoo has one real zebra, while the rest are cleverly-disguised mules. In the dodgy zoo, the statement 'there is a zebra in front of me' is not knowledge because it could be a cleverly disguised mule. This is because if I had looked at the other zebra, I would have been looking at the other zebra, I would have been looking at a fake zebra. So my knowledge when I'm looking at the real zebra seems accidental. This picks up on our concerns about the 'context' in which knowledge is formed (e.g. Fake Barn County)

It is important that our beliefs track the truth, i.e.<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">that they change as the facts change.</mark>

#### Criticisms

- Impractical for the knower: how can David know whether he would be able to distinguish between a cat and a dog dressed as a cat?
- Truth itself is impossible to track since it is a universal, objective concept which we might not have access to
- Counter-factuals are negative and complex construct/pull apart - not a satisfactory definition 
</br>

### [[Philosophy/What is Virtue Epistemology|Virtue Epistemology]]

At first glance, Virtue Epistemology seems similar to Reliabilism, yet the two are quite distinct. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Intellectual virtues are subjective, whereas a reliable cognitive process is objective.
</mark>
Zagzebski states that you know P IFF
- You believe that P
- Your belief that P arises from an <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">act of intellectual virtue</mark>


Zagzebski states that a virtue is a state of person that is good by way of helping the person achieve some good purpose or goal'
Zagzebski goes on to define a virtue as having two components:

- A virtue <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">motivates us</mark> to do what is good
- A virtue gives us the ability to be <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">reliable in forming true beliefs</mark>

Under Virtue Epistemology, a belief must be (using the archery analogy):
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Accurate</mark>: Does it hit the target? (Truth)
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Adroit</mark>: Is the shot skilful? (Use of intellectual virtues)
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Apt</mark>: Does it hit the target because it is adroit? (Did we reach truth because of our intellectual virtues?)
</br>

Virtue Epistemology deals with Gettier counterexamples by saying that (in the case of Smith and Jones) Smith's belief <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">would not count as knowledge in the first place</mark>, as it was merely a coincidence.

It deals with the counterexample of 'Fake Barn County' through Sosa's proposal of '<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">animal knowledge</mark>', which can be possessed by non-humans. Here, apt belief is equated to animal knowledge. This contrasts with the usual definition of knowledge (reflective knowledge) by the statement that human knowledge requires the ability to reflect upon your belief.

Virtue Epistemology deals with radical scepticism by making it completely irrelevant, because it <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">only deals with the exercise of intellectual virtues in the real world.
</mark>
Sosa's approach is criticised because many belief that Sosa has <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">moved the goalposts </mark>for defining knowledge. They say that Sosa seems to be exploring under what conditions a person can assert that they have knowledge, instead of asking under what conditions a person can know x or y. These are entirely separate endeavours, and it is possible that Sosa is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">committing the fallacy of equivocation in this case.</mark>
