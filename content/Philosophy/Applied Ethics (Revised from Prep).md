## Stealing
</br>

### Introduction

#### What is stealing?

Stealing is to deprive another individual of their property without permission and/or an intention to return it. The concept of stealing presupposes a system of rights - most fundamentally, the right to private property. As such,  stealing is viewed as a matter of justice.

#### How might the Act Utilitarian argue that stealing is wrong? How might a different Act Utilitarian contest this (with reference to Mill)?

Act Utilitarian may argue that stealing in certain circumstances (e.g. the mother whose family are starving stealing the rabbit from the wealthy landowner) creates greater happiness than not stealing and so, in that circumstance, is the morally right action. On the other hand, other Act Utilitarians might argue that a society in which stealing is morally permissible whenever it increases an individual’s (family’s/group’s) happiness would lead to greater unhappiness as people would lose trust in each other. The idea of ownership/private property collapses. J.S. Mill extends this: having and respecting property rights maximises happiness overall and in the long term, leading Mill to conclude that justice is the “most sacred” part of all morality, and stealing is always wrong, as a prime example of injustice (depriving someone of what is their own).

#### How might the Rule Utilitarian treat the issue of stealing?

Like Mill (indeed, developing the implications of Mill’s arguments, Rule Utilitarians would say) Rule Utilitarianism looks to long term consequences, arguing that following a clear and simple rule - o.e. ‘do not steal’ will most likely lead to better consequences overall (and so greater happiness) than either the initial Act Utilitarianism response of a ‘soft’ rule allowing multiple exceptions, whilst the clear and simple prohibition won’t lead to the greatest happiness in ever case (e.g. the rabbit scenario). Exception clauses are dangerous, because everyone thinks that they are the exception.
</br>


### Kantian Deontology

#### Explain the argument that Kantian deontology prohibits stealing (with reference to contradiction in conception and will, and the second formulation of the categorical imperative)

Stealing would appear a good example of a contradiction in conception: if we all took what we wanted then the idea of private property/ownership would disappear altogether (stealing presupposes the concept of private property). But does this apply to all stealing? How about the maxim ‘to steal to save a life’? Such a rare circumstance does not undermine the concept of private property as a whole. Kant would most likely reject this - the act remains stealing, regardless of the purpose. But maybe the maxim is ‘to save a life, even by stealing’ (which on the face of it changes the purpose of the act, which is now to save life) Indeed, it is a contradiction in will not to help others. Yet for Kant the duties of justice are more stringent than the duties of doing good - so we should not steal. 

A further argument against stealing might be based on the second formulation of the Categorical Imperative. For $x$ to steal from $y$ is fundamentally for $x$ to deny $y$ their autonomy - specifically $y$ ‘s freedom to choose what to do with their property. In short, $x$ treats $y$ not as an autonomous end but as a mere means to an end.

#### Is it possible to make a Kantian case for the moral permissibility of stealing?

Thus, it is very difficult to make a Kantian case for stealing.
</br>

### Aristotelian virtue ethics

#### Explain how Aristotle’s theory of justice might be applied to stealing

Aristotle’s account of the virtue of justice is essentially deontological - he defines it primarily in terms of just actions. Thus, there are some acts for which there is no mean: they are always wrong, and stealing - alongside adultery, for example - is one of the acts he names. Stealing always involves depriving, another, of what is just - i.e. what is their ‘share’. But what about stealing in an unjust context (e.g. famine-stricken mother stealing rabbit from rich landowner)? There are three possible responses: a) an unjust state of affairs that is the result of an individual’s actions demands rectification - so stealing might be justifiable; b) the unjust state of affairs is the result of unjust actions. In this case, stealing might be justified in the name of rectification; c) Stealing is an inherently just act and so the mean does not apply. 

We might reply in Aristotelian terms that there is a mean in circumstances whereby an individual’s ‘due’ or ‘share’ isn’t violated - whether this is the case is precisely a matter of circumstances requiring practical wisdom.
</br>

### Conclusion 

#### Is it always wrong to steal (with reference to the notion of property rights)?

Focussing on property rights, and making the point that there are limits to ownership (i.e. the right is not absolute): e.g. we can’t set fire to a book in a cinema simply because we have a right to do what we want with our own books. In short, property rights are conditional, not absolute, so in cases (e.g. the Robin Hood scenario) in which ownership is not in accordance with just laws, we might argue that what appears (or be claimed by some) to be stolen is not theft at all. In such cases - such as the Elgin Marbles - taking back is not theft because the ‘original’ ownership was not just.

## Eating animals
</br>

### Utilitarianism

#### What are the potential implications of Bentham’s Utilitarianism for the eating of animals?

On the grounds that moral with is inextricably connected to the potential to to experience pleasure and pain, in so far as animals experience thus, they are worthy of moral consideration. This has obvious implications for whether humans should eat animals. 

#### Is eating animals always wrong from a Utilitarian point of view?

For Peter Singer the obvious implication is that all eating of animals is wrong: ‘speciesism’. However: 1) the issue of whether the introduction of farming practises to minimise animal suffering would add to human suffering (the price of meat production soars and prices out much of humanity from eating an important source of protein, etc.); 2) The Bentham point applies to suffering rather than to killing as such. Thus, might argue that so long as the animal is killed painlessly, following a life of minimal suffering, then eating animals might be justified (minimal animal suffering weighed against Bic Mac joy.
</br>

### Kantian Deontology

#### Explain Kant’s view on how animals should be treated

Singer would claim that Kant is a prime example of a ‘speciesist’ - Kant restricts the group of beings entitled to moral consideration to those possessing a rational will - i.e. humans and only humans. Thus, we can eat animals because they are not ‘ends’ (second formulation of the categorical imperative).

he Kantian may argue that the matter is more complicated: we cannot simply treat animals as means without any moral consideration. Why not? We have a duty to be virtuous to other humans. We have a duty to develop/maintain our good will (and so act on our duties). Accordingly, Kant argues, if we lack kindness towards animals, we will lack kindness to other humans. So, we should treat animals well to protect our ability to be virtuous. We have no duties to animals, though we do have duties concerning animals, indirect duties.

#### How might Kant’s views on the treatment of animals be criticised?

We might argue that Kant’s account fails to explain what is wrong about mistreating animals: he says it is because of the indirect harm done to ourselves rather than the animal, which many might find confusing. Further, babies do not have a rational will, nor do people with a mental disability (in many cases, at least). We might immediately remove babies from this list as they have the potential to develop rational wills. But this leaves the case of the disabled, and an inconsistency - why are they treated differently to animals, if what is crucial is possessing a rational will. 

</br>

### Virtue Ethics

#### What ‘flaw’ in regard to the treatment of animals does Aristotle’s theory share with Kant’s theory?

It might be argued that Virtue Ethics shares an ‘animal problem’ with Kant: only humans partake in eudaimonia and only humans possess practical wisdom - so only humans are of moral concern. In short, both Kant and Aristotle accord a unique moral status to humans.

#### Explain Diamond’s account of animals as ‘fellow creatures’, including reference to the matter of pity

Cora Diamond, a modern Virtue Ethicist, seeks to correct this humanist bias. We recognise   - via our emotional responses to animals - that they share (to an indeterminate extent) emotional lives, as we do; similarly, that their lives can be better or worse. For us not to acknowledge this is to practise the vice of callousness - and to use them simply as means is gross selfishness. At the same time, it may be permissible to eat animals if the treatment of them is undertaken for the right reason, in the right way (free range, organic, etc.) and they are killed in a way that minimises pain. Because this is often not the case, the eating of animals is not a virtuous act. In recognising animals as possessing emotional lives we recognise them as fellow creatures appealing to (and deserving) our pity - an appeal to our virtue to which we need to respond as part of the pursuit of the eudaimon life.

</br>

## Simulated Killing
</br>

#### What is simulated killing? Why is it a moral issue?

Simulated killing is the enactment of killing in a fictional context, such as in video games. (N.B. There is a difference between witnessing such a thing and enacting it as the player). 

It is a moral issue not because of the action, but because of what is being represented, that is, murder. The question that must be asked is whether it is morally acceptable to take part in this. We may also be concerned over the effects of simulated killing on the people undertaking the action, and on how they treat other people in real life.

##### Revised

Simulated killing is the dramatisation of killing within a fictional - usually virtual - context. We might question whether this is a moral concern at all - no one is actually killed; no act is performed that violates a moral duty. And yet: what is depicted - i.e. killing - might well be considered a moral concern (e.g. is simulated killing virtuous?)
</br>

### Utilitarianism

#### What are the implications of Utilitarianism for the morality of simulated killing?

Utilitarianism must take into account the risk of harmful behaviour being transferred from this virtual world into real life. We must find empirical evidence to back up any idea that harm is done. However, Garry Young argues that the evidence is not conclusive. Some studies suggest that there is an increased risk of violence after playing a violent video game, whereas others suggest that this increased risk only affects those with a violent disposition in the first place. This is in the short-term. The long-term risks are even more inconclusive, and evidence is considered too weak to make any sort of judgement.

Even if there was evidence that simulated killing had negative effects on the real world, Utilitarianism would only deem it morally wrong if the pain inflicted outweighed the pleasure gained from playing the video game. 

Mill’s higher/lower pleasures distinction comes into play as well. Mill would dismiss such ‘childish’ behaviour as video games as a lower pleasure for adults. We may therefore think worse of an adult who played video games such as these, but not condemn the activity itself.

##### Revised

If simulated killing leads to greater unhappiness then it is not a moral good. Could it lead to greater harms - increased risks - of killing; aggressive behaviour; anti-social behaviour (e.g. becoming less sensitive to others’ distress/desensitised to real violence)? The empirical evidence to support the above concerns is greatly contested - some studies suggest a short-term impact of simulated killing; but other studies suggest that the impact is restricted to violent personality types and/or boys. There are relatively few studies of long-term effects, those studies are contested and few clear conclusions can be drawn.

Even if there is an increase in aggressive behaviour as a result of simulated killing, the Utilitarian should balance this against the potential pleasure generated by playing the game. For the Utilitarian, simulated killing is only morally bad if the overall harm outweighs the overall pleasure.

Might Mill have something to say about such a simple application of the Utility principle? Perhaps we might consider the ‘secondary principles’ of common morality - but is there such a principle given that video gaming is a relatively new phenomenon? This might point to the precedent of ‘playing war’ (gendered activity for boys) considered a ‘normal’ part of child development. In terms of Mill’s higher/lower pleasures distinction, might argue that the activity of simulated killing itself is not condemnable but with the ‘normal part of child developmen’ claim in mind, might argue that simulated killing is a lower pleasure that would be best replaced with a higher pleasure: e.g. the child ‘plays war’, the adult plays chess.

### Kantian Deontology

#### What is the Kantian concern with the morality of simulated killing?

Playing these video games alone is not a violation of one’s moral duty, however, if doing so damages one’s rational will, or leads to neglecting or violating one’s duty to another, then we may object. We can argue that cultivating such cruelty may undermine our willingness and ability to obey the second formulation of the Categorical Imperative. However, as with Utilitarianism, there is insufficient empirical evidence to suggest a link between simulated killing and a neglect of moral duty.

It may also be argued that, even if we do not fail in our duties to others, we may fail in our duty to ourselves. Perhaps repeatedly engaging in this activity erodes our sense of identity. However, it is unclear whether this is true.

##### Revised

N.B. Parallel with Kantian approach to killing animals: simulated killing itself is no violation of moral duty but of it damages one’s rational will/the neglect of one’s duty to other people. So, to the extent that simulated killing cultivates cruelty/indifference to others’ suffering, may be concerned with impact on behaviour towards others in real life. Indeed, Kant notes that butchers and surgeons did not serve on English juries (he is writing at the end of the 18th century) precisely because they were hardened to suffering and death.

Again, in response to Kant we might point to the lack of clear evidence to support the claim that simulated killing leads to moral desensitisation. A Kantian might argue that the issue is less duty to others than duty to oneself as a rational being (with a duty to cultivate one’s rational will) - thus, is that will best cultivated by spending hours play ‘Call of Duty’ rather than reading, conversation, etc.? If so, this might be a reason for avoiding too much ‘call of duty’.

### Virtue Ethics

#### How can Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean be applied to simulated killing?

Aristotle might say that simulated killing is wrong if it prevents the development of virtue and so prevents the gamer from achieving eudaimonia. This is because we may become unjust by doing unjust acts, which could arise from excessive acts of simulated killing.

The doctrine of the mean is agent-specific, and so will differ depending on who it is applied to. It may be virtuous for someone who understands the difference between the content of the game and reality, because their enjoyment of the game and the adrenaline that they may get from it is a helpful and safe expression of natural human aggression. However, a different person who does not understand this difference may not be virtuous when playing the game, because they may indulge in fantasies of actual killing.

##### Revised

Killing is an unjust act (in ordinary circumstances). We might argue that the cumulative effect of games involving simulated killing is the development of a character less disposed to just actions and thereby making it harder to live a eudaimon life.

Yet we might reply that this line of argument ignores the difference between simulated and actual killing - why need the former lead to a character more disposed to the latter?

Rather than focus on the development of character, might approach the issue via the question: ‘is simulated killing the action of a virtuous person?’. If it *is* the action of a virtuous person, then there is a right place, right time, etc. - including motivation - why would someone want to simulate killing? If the answer is ‘for pleasure’ - is that virtuous?

The commercial success of video games is evidence that these games are a source of pleasure.

But what sort of pleasure? There may be morally better and morally worse ways of relating to the simulated killing taking place in the game. Likewise, there may be morally better and worse ways of understanding the relation between the game and reality (simulated killing in the game as a ‘safe’ way of working through frustrations that might otherwise manifest in ‘real world’ actions).

In short, the mean is different to different people - for example, at different stages in their moral development. These considerations aside, the fundamental question remains: is simulated killing part of the good life? Is it what a virtuous person does?
</br>

### Player and Audience

#### What is the significance of the distinction between playing the killer and acting the killer?

‘Acting the killer’ is when the person undertaking the act does so on the understanding that their actions are seen as murder. An actor does not feel murderous rage or any similar emotions, and if they did so, this would be rather disturbing. ‘Playing the killer’, however, is when the gamer may fail to distinguish themselves from their character, and this lack of separation may have moral implications for the gamer.

#### Revised

Whereas the actor understands that their actions are imitative…

#### Explain the different relations between simulated killing and morality within a work of fiction

Different relations occur between simulated killing and morality depending on the circumstances. For example, does the author intends the immoral values of murder to be moral values within their fiction, or do they genuinely wish to portray these values as correct? On one hand, there may be something not virtuous about engaging with the immoral imagination of the author, and on the other hand, one may argue that it enables us to understand morality more deeply.

#### Is there anything morally wrong with watching simulated immoral killing?

There is only something morally wrong with watching simulated killing if the viewer engages with the view that killing in real life is correct because of the author’s intentions behind the narrative.

</br>

## Lying
</br>

### Utilitarianism

#### Explain Mill’s utilitarian position on the morality of lying (with reference to rule utilitarianism)

A simplistic act-utilitarian perspective would see the morality of lying as very easy: if the utility produced by the lie outweighs the negative consequences, then it is good; if not, it is bad. However, Mill’s position is that Utilitarianism should evaluate such actions as part of the big picture. In this case, a person being honest benefits the general happiness, and being able to trust other people is the basis of social well-being and a foundation of our civilisation and of our virtues. Weakening this would be severely damaging to happiness, and so to tell a lie simply for the sake of convenience is morally wrong.

However, Mill says that lying can be morally permissible in certain circumstances. We have to evaluate these circumstances to calculate the amount of pleasure or displeasure that will be produced from the action. Mill uses Kant’s example of the would-be murderer who asks you where his victim is. The harm done by lying about the whereabouts of said victim is far outweighed by the good done by saving a life, and thus lying is morally permissible.

The rule utilitarian may argue that a rule stating ‘don’t lie’ would produce more pleasure than a rule that permitted lying. However, Mill objects to this: never lying will lead to harm in certain circumstances. A rule would have to be created that allows for exceptions, but these exceptions are quite varied, and so this rule would be difficult to formulate. It is hard to know what the right rule for lying should be.

##### Revised

We might argue on simple act utilitarian basis that a lie is morally justified if it results in the greatest happiness. Mill is uncomfortable with this - there is more to calculations of utility than immediate/short-term consequences; lying needs to be viewed in a wider context.

For Mill, the ‘wider context’ is the fundamental role that truth-telling plays in our happiness as the basis of all inter-persona relationships and thereby virtue and civilisation itself. Weakening this foundation is thus detrimental to our pursuit of happiness. 

Yet he also holds that there are circumstances in which lying proves morally permissible - not least in cases of the greatest harm, e.g. the axe-murderer example (see Kant): less harm is caused by lying to the aspirant murderer than not lying - so, the lie is permissible. 

Whilst the rule utilitarianism might argue that that we should never lie (in the long term this will lead to the greatest happiness). Mill thus makes the point that there have to exceptions. But formulating a rule to account for exceptions is a slippery slope (we might suggest that Mill’s “harm principle” is his attempt to formulate such a rule).
</br>

### Kantian Deontology

#### Explain why Kant contends that lying is wrong and how that contention might be challenged

Kant states that making a false promise is immoral, because it makes a contradiction in conception. The same is true for lying. If everyone lied, then people would stop believing each other. But you can only lie if the person believes you. Thus, the maxim cannot be universalised, and lying is immoral. However, the maxim that we act upon may be more specific than ‘lie whenever I want’. For example, it could be ‘to lie in order to save a life’. This can be universalised, because in most situations in which we lie, no lives are at stake. People would still believe each other most of the time.

##### Revised

Kant mentions truth-telling (and so, not lying as a straightforward example of a perfect duty: good example of a contradiction in conception: you can deceive someone with a lie only if they believe that you are telling the truth).

We might object to Kant’s proscription of lying - what about maxims more specific than ‘lie to get what I want’, such as ‘lie to save a life’. Is this universalisable? In most lying contexts, lives are not at stake, so universalising this specific maxim would not undermine truth-telling as such (again, axe murderer example).

Why does Kant resist such responses? He might reply that the murderer would likely know about the “to save a life” maxim and so won’t believe the answer to the question about hidden Decem conformists. Hence, the maxim ‘to save a life’ isn’t universalisable.

#### What is the further argument against lying that Kant adds in his essay on lying and how might it be challenged?

Kant also argues that we do not know the consequences that will follow from us lying. It is always possible that we are mistaken, and if so, we have failed to do our duty, achieved nothing, and we are responsible for the results. It is therefore better to do our duty. However, this can be challenged, because we are similarly responsible when we tell the truth for the consequences, however negative they may be.

##### Revised

We don’t know the consequences that will result from our lie. Consequentialist moral reasoning generates scenarios like that in which your telling the axe-murderer that she should search the empty house at no. 52 (whilst you phone the police), but your phone is dead and unknown to you, the Decem conformists have left your cellar and hidden at no. 52, where the axe-murderer now finds them. Boo hoo - they are going to die, and you (liar) are responsible.

This shows the perils of the consequentialist moral thinking - a deontological approach is preferable (N.B. Yet Kant focuses on the responsibility of the liar, not the truth-teller - similarly responsible if he tells the truth that the Decem are in his cellar and the haven’t escaped to No. 52 because they are void of initiative).

#### With reference to the second formulation of the categorical imperative, explain how lying involves treating the other as a means rather than as an end

The second formulation of the categorical imperative states that we should always treat other humans as ends in themselves, not as means to an end. Lying breaks this imperative, because they are not able to make an informed choice about what to do, and are manipulated without their knowledge. It is impossible for them to share in our ends, because they do not have the knowledge of what our ends actually are. Even if the other person’s ends are immoral, and the only way to prevent them is to lie, we still should not lie, because we would be deceiving them about our intentions to thwart their own ends.

##### Revised

Lying would seem a straightforward breach of the second formulation of the categorical imperative in as much as the lie treats the person lied to as a means to the end conceived by the liar (rather than respecting that person as a fellow rational will to whom we have a duty of respect).

Thus, it follows from Kant’s deontology that if everyone was morally good then lying would always be wrong. Yet what if lying is the only means of preserving ourselves and others (as ends with inherent moral value) from the actions of others? In other words, the lie that prevents someone else using me as a means? Kant seems to recognise this limit: “If I cannot save myself by remaining silent, then my lie is a weapon of defence”.
</br>

### Virtue Ethics

#### Summarise Aristotle’s approach to truthfulness

Aristotle approaches truthfulness and lying as two extremes, in between which there is no correct action. Lying is a vice of excess already, and so cannot be virtuous. His other interpretation is that truth is a final end, and that lying is not always wrong, because their are situations in which it is appropriate.

##### Revised

Truthfulness is the mean between the vices of boastfulness (excess) and false modesty (deficiency). Also, Aristotle speaks of truthfulness (as the opposite of falsehood) as a final end to be pursued for its own sake. Thus lying and truth-telling are understood as actions alongside theft, adultery, murder, etc. for which there is no mean, as they are intrinsically bad (there is no ‘mean’ amount of lying).

#### How might an Aristotelian virtue ethicist justify lying?

Lying might be justifiable in that we are able to use practical wisdom to determine in which circumstances we may lie. If we wish to lie, and to do it virtuously, we would have to go about it in the right way, about the right things, with the right motive, and at the right time. It may also be justified if it is the last resort after exhausting all other options. 

##### Revised

Note that the status of truthfulness as an end to be pursued for its own sake does not necessarily proscribe lying in all circumstances (pleasure too is pursued for its own sake), but is does not follow that we should always pursue what is pleasurable. Aristotle is not especially bothered about boastfulness - it is more ‘futile’ (‘hot air’) than especially evil or harmful.

We might seek to justify lying from an Aristotelian perspective by suggesting that certain contexts in which a person’s motivation is good justify a lie. In this regard, practical wisdom is key, enabling us to judge when the lie is/isn’t justified. Perhaps the virtuous person is one who exhausts all other options and only lies as a last resort.
