# Difference between Reduction and Elimination

</br>

#### Briefly explain the difference between reduction and elimination

Reduction, as used in Mind-Brain Type Identity Theory, is when one concept is ‘reduced’ to another concept - the former is identical to the latter. For example, MBTIT argues that mental states can be reduced to physical states. Elimination, by contrast, is the elimination of a concept due to its incoherence.
