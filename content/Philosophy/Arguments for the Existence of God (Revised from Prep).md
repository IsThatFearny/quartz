# Arguments for the Existence of God (Revised from Prep)

</br>





### What characterises an ‘ontological’ argument?

An ontological argument argues that we can deduce the existence of God from the concept of God. Anselm and Descartes argue that to deny God’s existence is self-contradictory - their arguments seek to conclude that God necessarily exists.





The argument does not rely on experience of the physical world (i.e. it is not *a posteriori*), but is an *a priori* argument seeking to establish God’s existence by reflecting on the a priori concept of God. 
</br>

### Why does Anselm claim that God is a being greater than which cannot be conceived?

P1 in Anselm’s argument is that the idea of God of ‘a being than which no greater being can be conceived’. Anselm defines God in this apparently convoluted way because if we were able to conceive of a being greater than the being we call God, then that being would be God (for our initial idea of God would lack something that the second idea of God does not).





This might seem to be Anselm playing with words - but it is an example of the medieval concern to treat the idea of God with humility - that is, not to be presumptions that we can ‘know’ God. Hence, the ‘negative’ definition of God as a being no greater than which we cannot conceive.

</br>

### Outline and explain in detail the stages of Anselm’s version of the ontological argument


P<sub>1</sub>: By definition, ‘God’ is a being greater than which cannot be conceived
P<sub>2</sub>: We can coherently conceive of such a being
P<sub>3</sub>: It is greater to exist in reality (in re) and in the mind (in intellect) than only        to exist in the mind
C<sub>1</sub>: Therefore, God must exist





As P<sub>1</sub> the being ‘greater than which…’ and if P<sub>3</sub> is greater to exist in reality, the C<sub>1</sub> God must exist ‘in reality’

The point of P<sub>3</sub> is that if God only exists in the mind, then we can conceive of a greater being that exists in the mind and in reality.

This conclusion does not follow from the premises. Gaunilo argues that, By Anselm’s reasoning, it is possible to prove that any being/thing which is ‘more excellent’ must exist - as a result, Anselm’s concluding inference is flawed. 

Gaunilo: I can conceive of an island that is greater than any other island. And so such an island must exist because it would be less great if it didn’t. This is an absurd conclusion, and so the reasoning on which it is based (which mirrors Anselm’s reasoning) must be flawed.

In short, Anselm’s reasoning is flawed because with it any ‘most excellent’ being can be defined into existence.

N.B. Gaunilo slips from talking about the greatest conceivable being to talking about conceiving of a being that is greater than all other beings. This enables his argument to move from ‘God’ to the example of the ‘perfect island’ 

</br>

### Outline and explain the stages of Gaunilo’s perfect island objection to Anselm

Anselm counter-argues that his reasoning only applies to God (and so the 
‘perfect island’ or indeed any ‘perfect $x$’ is not a counter-example). He also argues that Whilst there is something inherently incoherent (self-contradictory) in thinking that “the greatest conceivable being doesn’t exist”, by contrast the thought “the greatest conceivable island doesn’t exist” is coherent - i.e. it does not involve a self-contradiction.





</br>

### How does Anselm answer Gaunilo’s objection? Does he succeed?

There is nothing in the concept of a perfect island that makes it necessarily the greatest conceivable island: there are some properties that *must* belong-to any island - e.g. it must be surrounded by water. But islands aren’t necessarily great or not.





By contrast, God is necessarily the greatest conceivable being (God would not be God if there was a greater conceivable being - P<sub>1</sub>). So, being the greatest conceivable being is a necessary property of God, and because ‘existence’ in reality is greater than existence merely as an idea, then the greatest conceivable being must necessarily exist.

</br>

### Explain Descartes’ concept of a ‘clear and distinct idea’

Descartes argument is characterised by the claim that the idea of God (as the idea of perfection) is innate; and his doctrine of clear and distinct ideas. A clear and distinct idea is on that is so self-evidently true that it cannot be logically doubted (e.g. doubted without self-contradiction). 





As far as Descartes is concerned, the idea of ‘God’ is just as clear and distinct as the concept of ‘triangle’. Just as a triangle ‘has three sides’ and ‘has internal angles sum to 180 degrees’ are necessary properties of the concept of a triangle (i.e. it is self-evidently true that a triangle must have these properties) so the properties of ‘omnipotence’ and other perfection, and, crucially, the property of ‘existence’, are necessary properties of the concept of God (Thus, God must have omnipotence, and God must exist). It is clear and distinctly true (and thus indubitable and self-evident) that God exists.

</br>

### Outline and explain in detail the stages of Descartes’ ontological argument

P<sub>1</sub>: I have an idea/concept of God
P<sub>2</sub>: My idea of God is of a supremely perfect being
P<sub>3</sub>: A supremely perfect being does not lack any perfections
P<sub>4</sub>: Existence is a perfection
C<sub>1</sub>: (My idea of) God must exist





</br>

This can be restated as:

P<sub>1</sub>: I have an idea of a perfect being
P<sub>2</sub>: Existence is a perfection, and must belong to a perfect being
C<sub>1</sub>: My idea of a perfect being must exist

N.B. In regard to P4, Descartes argues that existence is a perfection because it is entailed by other perfections. God is omnipotent, and so cannot be dependent on anything else for his existence (if he did, he would not be a supremely perfect being). An omnipotent being has the power to cause its own existence, so it must exist. God is the only concept that supports this inference to its own existence (as it is the only perfect being). 

</br>

### Explain how Hume’s fork may be used to object to Descartes’ ontological argument

Empiricists argue that no truth about the nature of the external world beyond the mind can be established by a priori reasoning alone. Thus, ‘God does not exist’ is not self-contradictory. 





Hume offers a version of this line of reasoning based on his fork. Hume’s fork distinguishes ‘matters of fact’ from ‘relations of ideas’. We know matters of facts a posteriori; we can know relations of ideas a priori. 

Hume’s application of his fork to the question of God’s existence:

P<sub>1</sub>: Nothing that is clearly and distinctly conceivable implies a contradiction (including conceiving of ‘God does not exist’)
P<sub>2</sub>: Whatever we can conceive of as existing, we can also conceive of as not existing
C<sub>1</sub>: Therefore, there is no being the non-existence of which implies a contradiction

In other words, if “god does not exist” *is* a contradiction then “God exists” is a relation of ideas. But this can’t be the case because claims about what exists are matters of fact (and so require empirical verification).
</br>

### Explain how Descartes might answer Hume’s criticism. Is he successful?

Descartes might respond in two ways:





Firstly, he might argue that the statement “God exists” *is* a matter of fact, but it is a matter of fact that we can verify simply by reflecting on the concept of God. In this, the concept of God is unique. 

Or, Descartes could insist that “God exists” is a relation of ideas, but not an obvious example that requires intuition/deduction to verify it.

In short, God is an exception. If we reflect carefully, we realise that God does not fit the confines of Hume’s fork. “God exists”, whether conceived as a matter of fact or a relation of ideas, is not limited by being defined in this way as other concepts are.

</br>

### Outline and explain Kant’s objection to Descartes’ ontological argument with specific reference to the argument that ‘existence is not a perfection’

Kant reworks Hume’s objection and, to most minds, makes it much more effective. Kant objects that ontological arguments misunderstand what it means to say that something exists: things don’t ‘have’ existence in the way that they ‘have’ other properties (‘existence is not a predicate’). In other words, the ontological argument treats “apples are green” as thought it were the same type of statement as “apples exist”. But, Kant argues, apples don’t ‘have’ existence in the same way as they have the property of greenness. In claiming ‘God does not exist’ is a contradiction, Anselm and Descartes treat ‘God exists’ as an analytic statement. In effect, they argue that the predicate (‘exists’) belongs to the subject (‘God’) by definition (much as “having three sides” belongs to to the subject “triangle”).





Kant argues that this is wholly mistaken. It is to treat ‘God exists’ as an analytic statement when in truth it is a completely different type of statement. ‘God exists’ tells us nothing about the concept of God, rather it asserts that God is an object of possible experience. All such statement are synthetic rather than analytic and need to be verified empirically.

The formal version of Kant’s criticism is as follows:

P1: If ‘God does not exist’ is a contradiction, then ‘God exists’ is an analytic truth
P2: If ‘God exists’ is an analytic truth, then existence is part of the concept of God
P3: Existence is not a predicate, something that can be added on to another concept
C1: Therefore, existence is not part of the concept god, and therefore, ‘God exists’ is not an analytic truth
C2: Therefore, ‘God does not exist’ is not a contradiction
C3: Therefore, we cannot deduce the existence of God from the concept of God
C4: Therefore, ontological arguments cannot prove that God exists

</br>

### What is the relation between Malcom’s and Anselm’s arguments?

Malcolm seeks to reconceive Anselm’s argument in a version that accepts Kant’s point that ‘existence’ is a different type of predicate than others (i.e. it is synthetic rather than analytic). N.B. Thus, Malcolm’s argument is a reply to Kant’s criticism of Descartes - this is the link to make in a 25 mark answer. Malcolm agrees that Kant does not show that necessary existence is not a predicate/property of God.





</br>

### Outline and explain Malcolm’s argument that God’s existence is either necessary or impossible

So, Malcolm’s argument relies on the claim that ‘God exists contingently’, which is a completely different claim (and the one that Kant successfully criticises) to ‘God exists necessarily’. Malcolm argues that ‘God exists necessarily’ is analytically true of the concept of God, because ‘necessary existence’ has a different logic to ‘contingent existence’. Kant agrees that if God exists, then God must exist necessarily, but that this does not entail that God actually exists - we still need to go out into the world and verify it. Malcolm claims that this does not make sense: if we accept that ‘God exists necessarily’ is an analytic truth, derived from the concept of God then this rules out the only other alternative (i.e. that ‘God might not exist’). In other words, ‘God doesn’t exist’ is necessarily false. 





P1: Either God exists, or he does not
P2: God cannot pass in and out of existence
C1: If He exists, His existence is necessary
P3: If God does not exist, God cannot come into existence
C2: Therefore, if God does not exist, then his existence is impossible
C3: God’s existence is either necessary or impossible.

Malcolm adds two further premises:

P4: God’s existence is only impossible is the concept of God is self-contradictory
P5: The concept of God isn’t contradictory
C4: Therefore, God’s existence isn’t impossible
C5: God must exist necessarily (as the only other possibility)

</br>

### Explain the objection that Malcolm fails to establish that the concept of God is not self-contradictory

The criticism is that Malcolm assumes as true a highly contested claim (as we saw at the beginning of the module). In short, if the coherence of the concept of God isn’t accepted then Malcolm’s argument fails. Malcolm argues that Kant fails to establish that necessary existence isn’t a property of God (and so that ‘God does not exist’ is necessarily false). Malcolm says that the concept of necessary existence has a completely different logic to the concept of contingent existence, whereas Kant treats them as equivalent for the purposes of his argument.





Malcolm claims that only contingent existential propositions are synthetic: only such propositions require us to go out into the world to verify them - propositions concerning necessary existence require reflection. Who is right? Malcolm or Kant? Is ‘God exists necessarily’ an analytic truth (Malcolm) or is the only analytic truth ‘If God exists, then he exists necessarily’ (Kant)?

Even if we allow that the concept of God is coherent (P5), then we cannot conclude that God’s existence is not impossible. If God doesn’t exist then God’s existence is impossible. Given our concept of God, whether God’s existence is impossible depends on whether God exists!

</br>

## Teleological/Design arguments
</br>






### What characterises teleological/design arguments?

The intellectual impulse behind design/teleological arguments is the idea that complexity, order, and regularity in objects implies planned/intended creation - i.e. that the complexity and order of nature implies that nature is the result of a designer. 





Such arguments are a posteriori in that they begin with the empirical observation/experience of complexity, order, etc. and derive from that experience the existence of an (unseen) designer of that complexity/order, namely God.

N.B. Kant focuses on the Ontological Argument because it is the only argument that, if successful, proves the existence of the omni-God. He says that even if one or more of the a posteriori arguments is successful they only prove that there is a designer and/or first cause of the universe - not the omni-God.

N.B.#2. Hume’s version of this argument is conceived by Hume as a prelude to him then criticising it.

### Outline and explain Hume’s version of the design argument

P1: In the fitting of means to ends (the intricate co-ordination of parts to achieve a purpose) nature resembles the products of human design





P2: Similar effects have similar causes

P3: The cause of the product of human design is an intelligent mind

C1: The cause of nature is an intelligent mind that intended the design

</br>

### Outline and explain Hume’s objections focused on the weakness of the analogy

Hume questions the analogy between the products of human design and nature/the universe - they are unalike. Hume questions the ‘great disproportion’ between a part of the universe and the whole universe - this undermines the inference in the argument that something like human intelligence caused the universe - so we cannot reasonably infer that the cause of nature is anything like a human mind.





Hume’s point is that even if we could infer from part to whole there is no compelling reason to choose an intelligent designer to explain the whole universe: thoughts ‘move’ the bodies of humans, but why suppose on that basis that thought (intelligence) is the first cause of everything?

</br>

### Explain Hume’s objection that we cannot show that the best explanation of order in nature is the existence of a designer

Hume’s point is that even if we could strengthen the analogy, the Design Argument faces a further objection: to infer an intelligent designer of nature we have to rule out competing explanations of the organisation of parts for a purpose. If we suppose that matter is finite but that time is infinite then given that there are only a finite number of possible arrangements of matter, then in infinite time all of those possibilities would occur - including the current situation.





Is the ‘finite-infinite’ argument a better explanation than a designer? We might ask why the arrangement of parts should benefit organisms: but this does not necessarily make it a worse explanation because the design argument faces similar problems - e.g….

The point is that the designer explanation is not clearly more compelling than the alternative possibilities - and so, Hume concludes, the rational conclusion is to suspend judgement (i.e. scepticism)

Hume argues that the inference from an effect (apparent purpose in nature) to a cause (a designer) contradicts our idea of causation. The idea of causation involves ‘constant conjunction’, Hume argues: we cannot tell from a single event (effect) what its cause is. A single effect might have various causes - so we need repeated experience of cause and effect occurring together to draw a causal inference.

The objection that Hume makes is that the universe is unique - it is a unique effect (in our experience). In order to draw a justified inference from effect (universe) to cause (as designer) we would need to have experience of multiple universes and a single cause - which we do not have. And even if we could make such an inference then all it would tell us is that the cause was capable of causing universes - not necessarily the God of the omnis.

</br>

### Outline and explain Paley’s design argument with reference to his understanding of design

P1: Anything that has parts organised to serve a purpose is designed





P2: Nature contains such things

C1: Nature contains things which are designed

P3: Design can only be explained in terms of a designer

P4: A designer must have a mind that is distinct from what the mind designs

C2: Nature was designed by such a mind

C3: Such a mind (i.e. God) exists


</br>

### Does Paley’s argument successfully answer Hume’s objections based on drawing analogy between the universe and human artefacts?

Yes: Paley’s argument is not one from analogy. He does not argue that natural things are *like* watches, and so their causes are not *like* the causes of watches. He argues that watches have a property - i.e. the organisation of parts for a purpose - which supports the inference of a designer. Everything that has this property has a cause, including natural things. Therefore, because natural things have this same property, we can infer that they too have a designer.





#### Revised

Paley might claim that his argument is not an argument from analogy at all: he does not argue that natural things are analogous with things such as watches  - rather, natural things possess a property (namely, the organisation of parts for a purpose) that is also possessed by human artefacts such as watches, and which requires a designer. Thus the argument is based on an inference: as the watch requires a designer, so it is reasonable to infer that natural things require a designer.

But, if we recognise that the universe is a unique case then the inference is questionable because if we viewed a watch for the first time (i.e. as a unique case) then we would not immediately infer that it had been designed. 

</br>

### Does Paley’s argument successfully answer Hume’s objections concerning the problem of inferring that the universe is designed because it is a unique case?

Paley’s argument is that, even if we had never seen a watch being made and could not understand how it was possible, we would still be correct to conclude, upon examination, that it was designed. We have enough knowledge about the causes of the organisation of the parts to serve a purpose to be able to infer that, whenever we come across such organisation, that it has been designed. The same argument can be applied to nature: all we need to know is the organisation of parts for a purpose, because this is sufficient grounds to infer that something is designed, and that therefore a designer exists.





#### Revised

Paley contests Hume’s claim that if we saw a watch for the first time we would not necessarily infer a designer: he says that understanding that the watch possesses the ‘organisation of parts for a purpose’ property is enough on its own to allow us to infer a designer.

</br>

### Explain Paley’s defence of the claim that the best explanation of order in nature is a mind

Paley rules out alternative explanations of the order that we see in nature, as per Hume’s argument. He accepts that there is a possibility that finite matter has taken all possible combinations over infinite time. However, he argues, this is a worse explanation than the idea of a designer, because there is no evidence that either 1) matter constantly pushes into new forms, or 2) all possible combinations of matter have already been tried. Paley claims that minds supply the only explanation of design we know of, and so the existence of a designer is the best explanation of the organisation of parts for a purpose.





#### Revised

Paley claims that the best explanation of order in nature is a mind - his argument is that the alternative (i.e. that it is possible finite matter has taken all possible forms over infinite time) is less likely, undermined not least by the point that we now know that time is not infinite. Instead, Paley concludes, ‘mind’ supplies the only reasonable explanation for design.

</br>

### What is the problem of Spatial Disorder and how does Paley respond to it?

The problem of spatial disorder is that there are vast areas of the universe that contain no organisation of parts, nor any purpose. How, therefore, can we say that these areas were designed, or at least designed by God?





Paley questions the strength of this objection: he claims that the inference from the organisation of parts for a purpose to a designer is correct, even if the watch sometimes went wrong or if some parts are unnecessary in achieving its purpose. In a similar vein, Paley argues that evidence of some imperfections and irregularities in nature does not undermine the inference that nature is designed, and we need not weigh one against the other in order to draw this conclusion.

#### Revised

Paley’s argument appeals to ‘spatial order’, most obviously the parts of a watch organised to serve a purpose. However, the example of the watch is supposed to provide the basis for claims about the universe, and yet the universe contains much spatial disorder; vast areas in which there is no organisation for a purpose (just flying rocks). 

Paley might challenge the problem of Spatial Disorder with the claim that the inference (not analogy!) from parts organised for a purpose to a designer is not weakened simply because the watch sometimes malfunctions or even if there are parts that aren’t integral to the function. Similarly, evidence of imperfections and irregularities in nature does not undermine the inference of a designer. Paley’s counter-point is that the balance of spatial order vs disorder isn’t critical - i.e. there is no requirement to weigh one against the other to tell that the ‘organisation of parts for a purpose’ is evidence of a designer.

</br>

### Explain the objection to Paley’s claim that the best explanation of order in nature is a mind based on the theory of evolution by natural selection

The objection argues that Paley was wrong in arguing that the organisation of parts for a purpose can only be the effect of a mind. If there is an argument that is better than invoking the existence of a designer, then Paley’s argument fails. 





Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection is an excellent account of how the appearance of design can arise without being the work of a designer. Darwin’s theory of evolution is simpler than the idea of a designer: there is no inference of something brand new, rather it appeals to what we already know exists.

#### Revised

To this point, the discussion has proceeded on the basis that there are two possibilities: the universe is the result of design or the result of chance. The theory of evolution by natural selection adds a third possibility (that Paley’s argument does not/cannot account for).

Paley’s argument is that design (organisation of parts for a purpose) can only be explained as the effect of a mind. But this is not so: the theory of evolution by natural selection provides an explanation of how the appearance of design can arise without a designer. 

According to the theory of evolution by natural selection, millions of alterations in organisms randomly occur, one following another. Most disappear, but traits that coincidentally aid survival are reproduced and slowly spread. This leads to greater complexity; as in the example of the eye, giving the appearance of design without a designer. What is more, it explains the appearance of design in terms of what can be observed, not requiring any additional assumptions (i.e. the need for a designer).333

So, if we accept the theory of evolution by natural selection, what is left of the design argument? This is the challenge taken up by Swinburne in the 20th century.
</br>

### What is the difference between spatial and temporal order?

[[Philosophy/Glossary#Temporal order|Temporal order]] is the order in which things follow each other, e.g. if you let go of something, it will fall to earth. These temporal regularities accord to the laws of nature. [[Philosophy/Glossary#Spatial order|Spatial order]] is the order that allows matter to be organised into parts that serve a purpose.





#### Revised 

Paley’s argument (the watch) appeals to *Spatial Order*: the spatial arrangement of different parts existing together at the same time for a purpose in an ordered way, e.g. cogs, springs, balanced in a watch. 

*Temporal Order*, by contrast, appeals to the orderliness of one thing following another in a temporal succession. Such temporal regularities are described by the laws of nature - e.g. the law of gravity (two masses exerting gravitational attraction on each other).

There are two advantages of temporal order over spatial order:

1) The laws of nature appealed to by temporal order are universal - this avoids the problem inherent in spatial order that the universe also exhibits spatial disorder
2) Temporal order is more fundamental than spatial order - examples of spatial order presuppose the existence - and regularity - of temporal order - e.g. the process of evolution: the spatial order that evolution produces (the spatial complexity of the eye, apparently (but not) parts designed for a purpose) is a result of temporal order. Evolution relies on temporal order.

Thus, the central point of Swinburne’s argument is that a designer God is the best explanation of the temporal order of the laws of nature.

 Note that Swinburne’s argument seeks to address the challenge presented by the theory of evolution: whilst evolution accounts for the appearance of design at the level of spatial order, evolution itself presupposes a temporal order, that, Swinburne maintains, is best explained by a designer.

</br>

### Outline Swinburne’s argument that science cannot explain the operation of the fundamental laws of nature

Swinburne argues that all explanations of the laws of nature presuppose other laws. Laws can be explained in terms of more general laws, but nothing else. We cannot explain the most fundamental laws of nature by science (and if we could, they would not be the most fundamental laws).





In other words, science must make an assumption about these fundamental laws if it wants to provide any explanation whatsoever.

#### Revised

Swinburne argues that there is no scientific explanation for the operation of the laws of nature: science explains *why* water boils when heat is applied to it. But we can only explain the laws governing the application of heat on the properties of molecules of more general laws. The point is that these general laws will presuppose further laws, and so on. But how do the most fundamental laws work? Swinburne’s point is that the operation of the most fundamental laws can’t be explained by science (if they could then there would be more fundamental laws, which in turn…).

In short, Swinburne argues, we need to step outside of science for an ultimate explanation of temporal order.

</br>

### Explain the difference between scientific and personal explanation

Scientific explanation is a method of explaining things using a scientific method. Personal explanation is explanations in terms of a person, i.e. a rational, free agent. We can explain an object or an event in terms of a person and their purposes.





#### Revised

Personal explanation is something we use all the time in our personal lives - we explain products of human activity in terms of a rational, free and purposive agent. In sum, explanation of objects/events in terms of an agent and their ends. So, we know of regularities in succession: event $y$ caused by the actions of agent $x$.

The question arising from this distinction is: can we explain the temporal order we find in the laws of nature (including evolution) in terms of personal explanation? Swinburne says ‘Yes!’: by supposing that there is a being (an agent) that can act on the universe in a way similar to how our actions move our bodies.

This being - a designer - offers a personal explanation for the laws of nature, as so the order of the universe, in terms of temporal order. The regularities of temporal order describe the actions of a person - a designer.
</br>

### Outline and explain Swinburne’s design argument

Swinburne argues as follows:





P1: There are some temporal regularities, e.g. related to human actions, that are explained in terms of persons.

P2: There are other temporal regularities, e.g. related to the operation of the laws of nature, that are similar to those explained in terms of persons.

C1: So we can, by analogy, explain the regularities relating to the operation of the laws of nature in terms of persons

P3: There is no scientific explanation of the operation of the laws of nature

P4: As far as we know, there are only two types of explanation - scientific and personal

C2: Therefore, there is no better explanation of the regularities relating to the operation of the laws of nature than the explanation in terms of persons. 

C3: Therefore, the regularities relating to the operation of the laws of nature are produced by a person.

C4: Therefore, such a person, who can act on the entire universe, exists.

#### Revised

P1: There are some temporal regularities related to human actions

P2: There are also similar temporal regularities in the laws of nature

C1: Therefore, by analogy, we can explain the regularities in nature in terms of humans

P3: There is no scientific explanation of the laws of nature

P4: As far as we know there are only two types of explanation: personal and scientific

C2: Therefore, there is no better explanation of temporal order in nature than temporal order in terms of persons

C3: Temporal order related to nature is produced by a person

C4: Therefore, such a person who can act on the entire universe - i.e. a designer exists

</br>

### What is Swinburne’s defence against Hume’s criticisms and is it successful?

Swinburne argues that we choose human reason as a model for explaining the operation of the laws of nature because other causes of order in the universe are reliant on the operation of the laws of nature which they don’t themselves explain.





Further, if applying Hume’s idea of spatial order being the result of random changes in matter distribution to temporal order, we must either say that there are no laws of nature, or that the laws of nature change over time, randomly producing order or disorder. However, both of these alternatives are highly problematic: we have no reason to say that there are no laws of nature, and every reason to think that there are. Perhaps the laws of nature could change randomly over time, but given the amount of order in the universe and the universal applicability of the laws of nature, this is a poor explanation of our experience. Swinburne’s overall argument is that explaining temporal regularities in personal terms remains the best explanation.

#### Revised

**The problem of analogy**

Swinburne offers an argument from analogy. So, we might (with Hume’s scepticism concerning analogies in mind) ask how strong the analogy between human action and the designer’s nature (through the laws of nature) is? Swinburne concludes that Hume’s objections to analogy may be successful. However, we need to pose the question of success in the context of inference to the best explanation (in other words, Swinburne asks whether there is a better explanation).

So, why choose human reason as a mode for explaining the operation of the laws of nature instead of another option? Swinburne’s reply is that we should do so because the other causes of (spatial) order in nature rely on the operations of the laws of nature, which they do not explain themselves.

Does Swinburne overcome Hume’s suggestion that Spatial Order might be explained in terms of the random distribution of matter? Can we apply this to Temporal Order as well? No. This would only work if there are no laws of nature, or if the laws of nature can change over time. But both of these alternatives are problematic: there is good reason to suppose that there are laws of nature, and and the regularity/order of our experience would suggest that they don’t change over time. So, Swinburne would conclude, explaining temporal order in personal terms remains the best explanation.

**The Unique Case Argument**

Hume argues that design arguments fail because they consider a unique case - i.e. the design of the only universe we know. Swinburne’s reply to this is that there are many conclusions that cosmologists have drawn about the universe even though it is a unique case. ‘Uniqueness’ is relative: e.g. many of the processes involved in the universe as a whole - its expansion - can be identified in numerous other processes.

</br>

### Explain the argument that even if the explanation in terms of a designer is technically the ‘best’ we still might not accept it if it isn’t a good explanation, and Swinburne’s response

We might object that, for the designer to be a satisfactory explanation of design in nature, we would need to explain the designer. A mind is as complex and as ordered as nature, and so if the order in nature requires an explanation, so does the order of a designer’s mind.





Swinburne argues that this misrepresents explanation. There are many examples of explanation which doesn’t assume what is assumed in the explanation. This is entirely normal, and has happened repeatedly throughout the history of science. We can therefore still say that the designer is a good explanation for the operation of scientific laws even if we can’t explain the designer.

#### Revised

A further criticism of Swinburne (whose argument, so far, is standing up rather well) is that even if the argument is technically the ‘best’ (because there is no alternative), should we still reject it, because it isn’t a ‘good’ explanation? For the designer to be a satisfactory explanation of design in nature, we would need to explain the designer. Because the mind of such a designer would be of a complexity similar to the complexity of the universe, we would also need to explain the order of the designer’s mind. This isn’t an easy prospect, and so we should accept the unexplained nature of the laws of nature as ‘brute facts’.

Swinburne’s reply is that the task of philosophy is to pursue and extend explanation wherever possible/conceivable, and so it is better to extend the explanation of the laws of nature with reference to a designer even it it is subsequently difficult to explain the designer. Simply to reject the designer as a possible explanation is arbitrary.

### Outline Hume’s six objections based on the idea that the designer is more similar to human beings than God is traditionally said to be

1) The scale and quality of the design reflect the power and ability of the designer, an because the universe isn’t infinite, we cannot infer that the designer is infinite. God is thought to be infinite, and so we cannot infer that God is the designer.
2) We have no reason to say that the designer is perfect. There is much evidence of mistakes in design. If we can prove these mistakes, then we should at the least say that the designer isn’t fully skilled. God, however, is said to be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, and so we cannot infer that the designer is God.
3) Designers are not always creators. God may have created the universe, but he logically does not have to have designed it.
4) The design may have resulted from small improvements made by many people rather than just one person, and we cannot assume that the powers to do this are united in a single being. God, however, is said to be one, and so we have no reason to believe that God is the designer over the possibility of lots of designers that are not divine.
5) Mind is always connected to body. There is no reason to think that the designer has no body, but God is only mind, and so the designer cannot be inferred to be God.
6) Designers can die as their creations continue. The designer could have designed the universe and then died, but God is everlasting and exists eternally, so we cannot infer that the designer is God.





#### Revised

1) The scale and quality of the design gives us no reason to suppose that the designer is infinite
2) Spatial Disorder gives no reason to suppose a perfect designer
3) Designers aren’t always creators
4) The design may be a collective effort (i.e. God is not a god)
5) In our experience, mind and body are always connected - but God is supposed to be mind alone
6) Designers can die whilst their creations continue to exist

In short, the argument from design, even if it does not show that the designer is like the ‘God of the omnis’.

### Outline and assess Swinburne’s response to Hume’s objections

Swinburne accepts arguments 1 and 2. He argues that arguments 3 and 4 can be knocked down by the use of Ockham’s razor: simplicity requires that we shouldn’t suppose the existence of multiple possible causes when only one is required…





#### Revised

Swinburne accepts arguments 1 and 2. In reply to 3 and 4, Swinburne invokes Ockham’s razor, which insists that we ought not to suppose multiple causes when a single cause will suffice as an explanation. The uniformity of nature suggests that a single cause is the most likely explanation. In reply to 5, the reason for not thinking that the designer as a mind must be accompanied by a body is that to suppose the designer *does* have a body is to limit the designer’s capabilities (specifically, having a body would imply the designer is limited to a particular space and can only act on that space, whereas the designer, as the origin of universal laws of nature, must not be limited in this way). In reply to 6, Swinburne says that Hume’s objection only applies to Spatial Order. If the argument is recast (as his is) in terms of Temporal Order, then the objection no longer holds - because God must continue to exist so long as the laws of nature hold.
