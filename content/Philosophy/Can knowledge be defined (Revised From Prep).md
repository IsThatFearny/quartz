# Can knowledge be defined? (Revised From Prep)

</br>

## Questions

</br>

### What are conditional statements? Give an example
<aside>x/y = Any given statement/claim/object</aside>
Conditional statements relate the truth of two propositions, and take the form 'if x, then y'. For example, 'if it is raining, then I am getting wet'


</br>
  

### Look at the definitions of 'antecedent' and 'consequent' in the glossary at the back of the book. Write your own version of these definitions
<aside>Ante: Prior/before</aside>
-   Antecedent: The propositional statement that comes after 'if' in a conditional statement. Implies cause, e.g. 'if it rains'
-   Consequent: The propositional statement that comes after 'then' in a conditional statement. Implies effect/consequence, e.g. 'then I will get wet'


</br>

### What is:

#### a) A necessary condition?
<aside>Must be present for a definition to be accurate, e.g. being unmarried is a necessary condition for being a bachelor, as you cannot be a bachelor without being unmarried</aside>
A necessary condition is a condition that must be met for the conditional statement to be correct

</br>
</br>

#### b) A sufficient condition?
<aside>A condition which fulfils the criteria for a definition without need for further conditions, e.g. being unmarried and being a man are sufficient conditions for being a bachelor, as nothing else is needed to fit this definition. Simply being unmarried is not sufficient, as you could be unmarried and a woman, and therefore not a bachelor</aside>
A sufficient condition is a proposition for another when the first cannot be true while the other is false  

</br>  
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

### How are necessary and sufficient conditions useful in providing definitions?
<aside>An accurate definition must include all necessary conditions and these necessary conditions must, together, be sufficient</aside>
Necessary and sufficient conditions are useful for providing definitions in terms of something else, e.g. Defining a bachelor in terms of being an unmarried man

</br>

### Explain the claim that 'p is true' is a necessary condition for knowledge, but is not a sufficient condition
<aside><p>P is necessary, as it needs to be true to be knowledge. However it is not sufficient, as it cannot be something that is true, e.g. 'the world is spherical' (P) is true, but is this enough to say that Will (S) (who thinks the earth is flat), knows it? Probably not.</p> <p>e.g. (2) If S knows that P, then P is true, and so truth is a necessary condition for knowledge. However, truth is not a sufficient condition for knowledge, as there are other conditions necessary for S to know that P.</p></aside>
We cannot have knowledge of P if P is false, so it is a necessary condition. However, it is not enough to be a sufficient condition for knowledge, as there are many other true propositions that we do not know.

### How can we use counterexamples to test whether a definition is successful or not?

A counterexample is an instance that rules out a certain claim. If a statement has both necessary and sufficient conditions, we can use a counterexample to attempt to prove that a condition is not necessary.  

##### Revised
They are examples which challenge the necessary and sufficient conditions of a definition, to test whether a definition is accurate or not, e.g. torturing David makes us all very happy but it is not good. This suggests that happiness for the greatest number is not a necessary condition
</br>

### What makes a good definition?

A good definition should not be circular and should not use the concept that is being defined. If a definition can be positive, it should not be negative. A good definition should also be informative  

##### Revised
Not circular - Cannot rephrase or repeat the key term, e.g. a bachelor is a bachelor
Informative - Tells us what we don't know from the term alone
Uses the concepts which we understand more easily
Avoids counterexamples

</br>

## Exam Question

### Explain the method of finding necessary and sufficient conditions to define a concept

To test for sufficient conditions, you must swap the conditional around to see if it still makes sense. If it does, then the condition is sufficient. 
To test for necessary conditions, you must determine if A relies on B for it to be true. If it does, then the condition is necessary.
