# Eliminative Materialism 5 Markers (In Class)

</br>

### Outline the main claims made by eliminative materialism

Eliminative Materialism eliminates all talk of mental states, instead claiming that it is only meaningful to talk of brain states; thus all talk of mental states can be eliminated entirely (it is not just a reduction) and talk of mental states does not refer to anything in the world.

This claim is supported by neuroscientific evidence as it explains the relationship between things that happen in the brain and our experiences, e.g. to experience pain is to have certain neurons firing, which we can observe via a CT scan. Pain is not a separate state to the brain.

Eliminative materialism claims that the development of neuroscience will lead to a full physical explanation of what we now refer to as mental states, meaning we can discard mental states as a concept. For example, we used to believe that caloric fluid transferred heat between objects but now we know this is not the case and so we have eliminated all talk of caloric fluid. Similarly, we can eliminate talk of mental states once we can explain them in physical terms.

### Explain the claim that Eliminative Materialism is self-refuting

Eliminative Materialism claims that mental states do not exist and talk of them can be eliminated entirely. This includes concepts such as “belief” and intentionality. But this causes a problem for the theory. It seems that it is self-refuting. This is because the theory of eliminative materialism itself is expressed as an intentional belief - it is the belief that beliefs do not exist. Thus, if eliminative materialism is true, then the theory itself is meaningless; so are any arguments for it. Unless eliminative materialism can provide an alternative account of meaning, arguments and claims that do not rely on beliefs and intentional mental states (which it does not) it can only be articulated in terms of intentional mental states, which it claims do not exist, so the theory refutes itself.
