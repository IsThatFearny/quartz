# Soft Behaviourism Questions
</br>

## What is a Disposition?

A disposition is how something will, or is likely to, behave under certain circumstances. For example, solubility is a disposition - sugar is soluble, but it isn’t necessarily dissolving at the present moment. Dispositions can be expressed using ‘if… then’ statements, such as ‘if I place a sugarcube in water, then it will dissolve’.

## Explain the Claim that May Mental Concepts Are Dispositional Concepts

When we talk about someone having a certain mental state, we are really talking of what they would/could do in certain circumstances or situations. E.g. in saying that someone has the mental state of pride, we are saying that they may manifest pride in certain scenarios. Some mental concepts refer to complex dispositions (indefinitely heterogenous dispositions), the example given being that pride can manifest in many various subtle ways.

## Compare and Contrast Hempel’s ‘hard’ Behaviourism and Ryle’s ‘soft’ Behaviourism

Hard behaviourism asserts that all propositions about mental states can be reduced, without loss of meaning, to propositions about behaviour and physical states. By contrast, soft behaviourism states that propositions about mental states are simply propositions about behavioural dispositions, i.e. what someone would likely do in a certain set of circumstances.

## How Does Logical Behaviourism Solve the Problem of other Minds?

To understand what others say and do (i.e. their behaviour) is to understand that they have minds. We can know this because we can know that they behave in particular ways. The link between behaviour and minds is purely logical rather than empirical.
