### How does metaethics differ from normative ethics?

Whilst normative ethics discusses which normative principle we should adopt (pleasure? duty? virtue?) in making moral decisions about how to live, metaethics asks ‘what is morality?’.

### Summarise the questions posed by metaethics in a) philosophy of language; b) philosophy of mind; c) metaphysics; and d) epistemology

(N.B. questions 2, 3 and 4 enlarge on what the metaethical question ‘what is morality?’ involves)

#### a) Philosophy of language

What is the meaning of statements such as ‘killing is wrong’, ‘courage is good’, etc.? Are they statements of fact (do they have ‘truth value’ can they be true or false)? Or, are they statements (expressions) of approval/disapproval of actions or character traits

#### b) Philosophy of mind

What is involved in holding one particular moral view rather than another? That is to say, is ‘killing is wrong’ a factual statement and so a belief, or does it display an emotional attitude towards the act of killing - an expression of approval or disapproval? Or a motivation?

#### c) Metaphysics

If moral statements state truths (if they have truth value) are these truths objective? Are they moral properties of reality/the external world beyond the mind?

#### d) Epistemology

If there are moral truths then how do we discover them? If not - and they are expressions of subjective feeling - is there such a thing as moral reasoning? How are our moral claims to be justified? How do we ‘argue’ about them?

### Explain what it means to claim that moral principles originate a) in reason; b) in emotions/attitudes; and c) in society

Moral statements originate:

- In reason
	- Moral realism: The origin of moral principles re similar to the origin of scientific beliefs (empirical approach) or similar to the origin of mathematical statements (rationalist approach)
- In emotions/attitudes
	- Non-cognitivists argue that moral statements don’t have truth value. Instead they are subjective feelings/attitudes of approval about how we feel ourselves and others should act
- In society
	- Moral relativism (‘cultural relativism’). Moral principles are inter-subjective: morality arises out of due need to regulate/organise social relations

### What is the difference between cognitivism and non-cognitivism?

Cognitivists argue that moral statements are beliefs, which non-cognitivists argue that moral statements are mental states based on attitudes or feelings (emotions). 

### Explain the difference between cognitive and non-cognitive mental states in terms of the ‘direction of fit’

The idea of ‘direction of fit’ clarifies the cognitive/non-cognitive distinction: desires have a ‘world-to-mind’ direction of fit - we seek to change the world to fit our desires. By contrast, beliefs have a ‘mind-to-world’ direction of fit - we seek to change our beliefs to fit the world. So, is the statement ‘killing is wrong’ a belief about the way the world is - a moral fact that exists ‘out there’ in reality - or is it like a desire to make the world a place in which there is no killing? Cognitivists take the former approach, non-cognitivists the latter.

### What are the principle challenges facing a) cognitivism and b) non-cognitivism?

#### a) Cognitivism

Moral motivation: Non-cognitivism argues that moral judgements, like desires, are motivating. Factual beliefs this motivational quality. Because moral beliefs are motivating, they are thus attitudes rather than beliefs (N.B. This is also an argument for non-cognitivism). Some cognitivists argue that factual beliefs *are* motivating; others are content that factual beliefs don’t motivate.

#### b) Non-Cognitivism
Moral Mistakes: Cognitivists argue that morality is something that we can be right and wrong about. Whether ‘killing is wrong’ is not simply a matter of one’s feelings/inclinations/taste. Thus, non-cognitivism faces the challenge whether it reduces moral commitments to matters of taste and personal inclination - does non cognitivism thus lead to moral nihilism (i.e. nothing is morally true or false)?
