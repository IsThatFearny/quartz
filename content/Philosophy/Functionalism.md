# Functionalism

</br>

- Function = ‘characteristic activity’

> [!quote] Hilary Putnam argues...

> ‘Pain is not a brain state… [it] is a functional state of the whole organism’

Philosophical behaviourism argues that mental states can be equated to behavioural states, but this ignores the causal power of mental states; we generally think that mental states *cause* behaviour. For the functionalist, mental states are equal to functional states. What makes something, e.g. a screwdriver, is its characteristic activity, e.g. the fact that it drives screws into things rather than its physical makeup.

For Putnam, mental states are defined by the causal/functional role they play in events. To have mental states $x$ is to have functional state $x$. Behaviourism, meanwhile, argues that mental states are just the outputs (behaviours).

The functional state of pain is characterised by being produced by damage and causing other mental states and physical states such as fear and screaming.

Functionalism can be:

1) Dualist: The mind exists as a collection of functional states and exists as an independent substance/property
2) Physicalist: functional states supervene on physical states and adapt to changes in physical states

Minds are not an exclusively human possession - aliens, dogs, cats, or even computers could have minds.

### Causal role functionalism

Functional state = inputs (causes) + outputs (effects). E.g. Hunger: Stomach rumbling + feeling of emptiness —> searching for food

</br>

### Machine table functionalism

Functional state = inputs (causes) + states = outputs (effects). E.g. Hunger: Stomach rumbling + feeling of emptiness —> 1) IF disposed to hunger, THEN shouting will occur; 2) IF no food in the house, THEN you will go to the shops; 3) IF trying to lose weight, THEN will remain cross and starving.


</br>

### Advantages over behaviourism

1) Avoids circularity - inclusion of inputs includes other mental and sensory states. This means that the ‘circle’ is broken; it recognises the importance of other mental states in understanding behaviour and mental states
2) Mental states cannot just be understood in terms of behaviour, e.g. pain is much more than just pain behaviour (e.g. super spartans)
3) Mental states cause behaviour, e.g. if we are hungry, we search for food. Philosophical Behaviourism has to claim that behaviour exists without mental causation

## Questions (Lacewing pp. 276-285)

</br>

### What are phenomenal properties and how can they be considered as an issue for functionalism?

Phenomenal properties are ‘properties which give an experience its distinctive experiential quality’. They can be used as an objection to functionalism as follows: if phenomenal properties are qualia (i.e. intrinsic and non-intentional) then they cannot be completely understood in terms of their causal roles, because these are relational, rather than intrinsic, properties. Experiential quality cannot be analysed in terms of functions, because, for example, the feeling of pain is not *just* the causal relation of pulling your hand away from a fire. The formal argument proceeds as follows:

P1: Qualia, by definition, are intrinsic, non-Intentional properties of conscious mental states
P2: Intrinsic, non-Intentional properties cannot, by definition, be completely analysed in terms of their causal roles (or as machine-table states)
C1: Therefore, if qualia exist, some mental properties cannot be analysed in terms of their causal roles (or as machine-table states)
P3: Functionalism claims that all mental properties are functional properties
which can be completely analysed in terms of their causal roles (or as machine-table states)
C2: Therefore, if qualia exist, functionalism is false
P4: Qualia exist
C3: Therefore, functionalism is false

</br>

### What is the purpose of thought experiments in philosophy?

The purpose of thought experiments is to test a hypothesis or philosophical claim. To do this, we imagine a hypothetical situation, apply the given claim, and form a judgement based upon how that claim holds. They are used when physical experiments are impossible, or when judgements cannot be investigated through empirical means

</br>

### Explain the objection to functionalism from inverted qualia


If we can show that it is possible for two people to have identical functions but differing phenomenal properties, then we can show functionalism to be false.

For example, suppose that two people are looking at ripe tomatoes and fresh grass. They have learned to use the word ‘red’ to describe the tomatoes, and ‘green’ to describe the grass (having been taught the same language from birth). Both would say that the tomatoes are red and the grass is green, but the way a ripe tomato looks to the first person may be the way grass looks to the second. Functionally, they are identical, and yet experience different colours. ‘The way grass looks to you’ and ‘The way grass looks to me’ are caused by the same inputs, and cause the same outputs, but refer to different qualia. If this is possible, then functionalism is false, because it denies the possibility of inverted qualia.
</br>

### How can the functionalist reply to this objection? Refer to Churchland’s issues with the inverted qualia thought experiment

The functionalist can reply that, in the example above, the two people are not functionally identical. There are small difference, because causal relations of phenomenal properties are complex. Patricia Churchland argues that we have no good reason to think that qualia can be inverted in the above way.

Churchland clarifies that the main claim in the argument from inverted qualia is that two brains could function in the same way, but we would have different qualia. This is not being proposed as an empirical hypothesis, because it is not tested against empirical means. We have no evidence that identical brain functioning gives rise to different experiences in different people. Further, there could be undetectable empirical differences (undetectable because they make no functional difference). Science does not, however, naturally proceed by supposing undetectable facts, and so the argument is either false, or bad science.

The argument (here defined as $x$) could therefore just mean that ‘it is conceivable that $x$’. This makes the argument the same as other arguments from conceivability, and so it can be objected to in the same ways.

Churchland goes on to point out that this thought experiment is too simple, because every colour that we can discriminate has unique relations to its surrounding colours. There is a functional difference between ‘red’ and ‘green’.

</br>

### Outline the discussion which follows Churchland’s response

There is a response to be made, namely that we can change the thought experiment and this would allow functionalism to hold. If we were to invert the whole colour spectrum rather than simply red and green, then we would retain all relations, but simply inverted. However, this meets a problem, namely that we can make much finer discriminations in certain colour spectrums than others. If we inverted everything, then this would become apparent from behaviour. Therefore it is empirically possible for someone to have inverted qualia without functional differences.

It is still conceivable that we would correct for this, but Churchland asks if we should say that this person really sees the same colours as us? The colours that they see bear different similarity relations to every other colour. We must question what is essential to a colour.

### With reference to Block’s China thought experiment, explain the objection from a functional duplicate with no qualia

Block argues that it is possible for two systems to have states with identical functions, but one system has phenomenal properties while the other does not.

Block proposes a specific thought experiment: he proposes a human body that is connected to the whole population of China via electric transmitters. The Chinese have two way radios, and for a short time, the population realises the same machine table that describes the functions of your mental states. If functionalism holds, Block argues, then this should create a mind, but it is difficult to believe that there is a Chinese consciousness. The Chinese system, although a duplication of your functioning, cannot duplicate your mind because some mental states are qualia, and the system can’t have qualia because they are not functional states.

</br>

### How might the physicalist reply to Block’s objection?

The Physicalist might reply that if the Chinese have intentional mental states, then functionalism can provide an accurate account of all mental states, save for consciousness of phenomenal properties, which involves qualia. The intrinsic properties of qualia depend on the specific physical properties of the system that realises the functional states. Therefore, what mental states something has depends on its functional properties *and* its intrinsic physical properties. Mental states remain nothing more than physical states playing a functional role

### Chalmers on Consciousness

Chalmers argues that consciousness is like nothing which can be found in science. Consciousness ≠ mind (there can be unconscious mental states + processes). Consciousness in Chalmers’ sense is not reflection + attention, rather it is the subjective nature of our experiences. Cognitive science has focussed on the former rather than the latter. We need two concepts of mind: Phenomenal - mental states characterised by subjective qualities of experience, aka qualia; and psychological - explaining brain processes. Phenomenal concepts are ‘new’ and are not explained by the psychological account; we only know about the phenomenal by direct experience.

Functionalism only accounts for psychological properties and cannot account for phenomenal ones. We often talk about mental states as functional states, i.e. the inputs and outputs of pain, but this doesn’t fully account for the state of pain - the ‘what it is like’. The psychological account is not sufficient for a full understanding of mind.

There are two problems of mind: how physical systems have psychological properties; and how physical systems have phenomenal properties
