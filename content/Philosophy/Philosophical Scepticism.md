# Philosophical Scepticism

Scepticism is the claim that we cannot know anything about the external world.

- We need to doubt in order to know
- It is particularly a problem for empiricism because it relies on knowledge by sense experience, which is fallible
- It goes beyond normal incredulity (things that are difficult to believe)

## Types of Scepticism

Global Scepticism: Doubting knowledge of all synthetic propositions

Local Scepticism: About specific issues in epistemology  (e.g. doubting God’s existence)

Academic Scepticism: Our sense experience can be misleading so we can;t know anything for sure, e.g. a pencil in water looks bent but is actually straight. This is Descartes’ First Wave of Doubt - we would be wise not to trust that which has already deceived us

## Arguments for Scepticism

Dreaming Argument: We cannot clearly distinguish between dreaming and waking life, e.g. I could be dreaming that I am in this lesson

Evil Genius Argument: Even if I can know through my sense that I am not dreaming, there could be an evil genius/demon deceiving me about the nature of the external world, maths, etc.

Descartes’ response to scepticism starts here - he goes on to show that we can know some propositions a priori

Brain in a Vat Argument: We cannot know that we are not a brain hooked up to a computer which provides us with ‘experiences’ of the external world. This is the modern version of Descartes’ argument, attributed to Harman but popularised by Putnam in his rebuttal of the argument.
