# What is Virtue Epistemology?

Epistemology is a normative discipline, meaning that it is concerned with questions about how we ought to form beliefs, evaluate evidence, etc.

It assumes that:
- Questions on virtues and vices are fundamental to Epistemology
- Epistemology is a normative discipline

This is different from NFL (No false lemmas) because it focuses on who we are, rather than solving the puzzle of knowledge - About the knower, not the knowledge

Knowledge is that which is arrived at by one's intellectual virtues (abilities, skills, reasoning, etc). In contrast, Gettier cases are where knowledge is arrived at by luck  

Radical Scepticism is the claim that we cannot know anything about the world. Virtue epistemology only deals with the exercise of virtues in the real world, therefore scepticism becomes irrelevant

Medal has intellectual virtues but this does not mean that she will always believe what is true. Even Medal is fallible! Everyone makes mistakes. Medal could exercise intellectual virtues (motivated to find the truth. Does what is needed to find the truth, and acts as a virtuous person would do) and still not get to the truth.

e.g. in Barn County - Henry has exercised his intellectual virtues but has not gained knowledge because it is accidental.

OR

e.g. Lucas circa 1603 believed the earth was flat. He used his intellectual virtues to conclude this but believed a falsehood

Knowledge = Beliefs arising from acts of intellectual virtue (suggests the truth condition)

### Sosa's account 
AKA 'Triple A'

Three things are needed (archery analogy):

- Accuracy: Does it hit the target? (Truth)
- Adroitness: Is the shot skilful? (Use of intellectual virtues)
- Aptness: Does it hit the target because it is adroit? (Did we reach truth because of our intellectual virtues)

So, in the case of Smith and Jones, Smith's belief is accurate (i.e. true) and the method is skilful (he has used intellectual virtues), but it is not apt, as the truth was actually arrived at by accident
