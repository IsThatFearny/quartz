# Are the JTB conditions jointly sufficient?

Assuming that J + T + B are all necessary conditions for knowledge, we must now ask whether they are jointly sufficient. 

Edmund Gettier famously challenged the JTB definition in his paper, 'Is Justified True Belief knowledge?'

For example:

1) Smith and Jones apply for the same job
2) Smith knows that Jones has 10 coins in his pocket
3) The boss tells Smith that Jones will get the job
4) Smith therefore comes to the conclusion that 'the man with 10 coins in his pocket will get the job'
5) Unbeknownst to Smith, he also has 10 coins in his pocket
6) Smith gets the job

In this scenario, all conditions hold, yet he doesn't have knowledge.
