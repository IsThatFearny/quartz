</br>

## Utilitarianism Overview
</br>
Utilitarianism asks three questions:

- What is 'right': What is 'right' are actions that aim to produce the greatest happiness (of the greatest number) n.b. actions are right or wrong in view of their consequences - what state of affairs do they result in - focus on outcomes, specifically act consequentialism

- What is 'good': The only/ultimate good is happiness (Happiness = Pleasure)

- Who counts?: Utilitarianism has an egalitarian approach to happiness - everyone's happiness is of equal importance ('everyone' is an equal member in "the number")

</br>

Utilitarianism's aim is to 'maximise happiness' (greatest happiness for the greatest number)

</br>

Act Utilitarianism: Simple and clear decision making process based on assessing the qualities of available alternative actions, i.e. what will happen if we take this action or that action? Which action will maximise happiness?

</br>

## Bentham's Quantitative Utilitarianism

</br>

### Principle of Utility
The guiding principle of this form of Utilitarianism is the principle of Utility. This can be described as 'the greatest happiness for the greatest number'. It claims that when judging actions to be morally right or wrong, we should only take into account the utility that said action will bring


### Felicific Calculus
Jeremy Bentham claimed that we could measure quantities of pleasure (hence 'quantitative'). He proposed seven criteria:
- Duration: How long does the pleasure last?  
- Purity: How unlikely is it to be 'contaminated' by pain?  
- Intensity: How 'strong' is it?  
- Fecundity: How likely is it to result in future pleasure?  
- Certainty: How reliable is it?  
- Propinquity: How accessible/near is it?  
- Extent: How wide is its effect?

This was intended as a method to calculate whether an action was the 'right' thing to do,

### Intuitive Appeal

Bentham's Utilitarianism had an intuitive appeal. If happiness is good, then it is perfectly reasonable to want more of it, so we should therefore maximise it. In addition, treating people as equal is an appealing method. It is also very simple and easy to understand

### Criticisms
There are arguments to be made that:

- Happiness is not the only good
- We cannot empirically investigate happiness
- Conflicting happiness and rights
- There are circumstances in which happiness should not be maximised
- It is narrow minded to confine morality to a single measure of 'good'

</br>

## Mill's Defence of Utilitarianism

Mill responds to a number of criticisms to Utilitarianism:

#### That it ignores the value of pleasure

Mill reasserts Bentham's claims: that 'actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness'; 'by happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain and the privation of pleasure'; and 'Pleasure, and freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as ends'

#### That it is redundant because 'we do not need happiness'

Mill defends against this objection by stating that this is irrelevant, as the sacrifice of happiness is virtuous when done for the happiness of others.

#### That Utilitarians make right or wrong depend upon the agent's happiness

Mill says that the criterion of right action is the happiness of everyone, and we should therefore organise society in a way that maximises this

#### That Utilitarianism is a godless theory
Mill states that Utilitarianism is not a godless theory, as it can be made compatible with religious teachings

#### That it will lead to people sacrificing moral principles for expedient moral action

Mill says that if an action is expedient, then Utilitarianism condemns it, as it sacrifices the greater happiness for immediate gratification

</br>

## Mill's Qualitative Utilitarianism

Mill defines happiness in a more complex way than Bentham, stating that happiness is not 'a continuity of highly pleasurable excitement, but moments of such, in a existence made up of few and transitory pains, [and] many and various pleasures'

Mill argues that when happiness is understood like this, it is attainable, and that while we can't always expect pleasure, we can diminish suffering over time.

### Higher and Lower Pleasures

Mill says that we can distinguish between 'higher' and 'lower' pleasures, in correspondence to human capabilities. Lower pleasures are those associated with physical/sensual gratification, while higher pleasures are those associated with the gratification of our higher emotional and intellectual capabilities.

Mill says that we can test for higher pleasures through the 'test of competent judges': only the competent judge can distinguish/determine the higher from lower pleasures by virtue of having extensively experienced both types of pleasure.

### Criticism

Critics say that humans do not reliably choose higher over lower pleasures. However, Mill argues that there is a distinction between 'preference' and 'action'. The reason we might not act in accordance with what we know would be of greater value is laziness, weakness of will, or lack of readily available pleasure
</br>

## Smart on Hedonistic and Non-Hedonistic Utilitarianism
</br>

### 'Ideal' Utilitarianism

Smart says that G.E. Moore is an 'ideal' utilitarian, as he rejects the argument that pleasure is the only good, and argues that there are other states of mind such as knowledge

### Equality of pleasure

Smart agrees with Mill that not all pleasures are equal. He proposes the 'electrodes in the brain' scenario - at the press of a button the electrodes cause experience of intense sensory pleasure (i.e. Bentham's aim) and no concomitant pain. Would we say, Smart asks, that this is the ideal? Is this what we would prefer? Mill and Moore would answer 'no', because we would prefer a life in which there is scope for satisfaction of thought, feeling and imagination, as opposed to Bentham, who would argue 'yes'

### Quality of Pleasure 

Smart claims that Mill is not a pure hedonist, as his view can only defend higher pleasures in terms of their fecundity. Smart states that what is important is out attitude to pleasure - whether we 'approve' of it or not. Mill's distinction between higher and lower pleasures implies something different to pure hedonism. Mill introduces an evaluative/qualitative element according to which some pleasures are higher not because of intensity/fecundity but instead because they help us realise our unique emotional/intellectual capabilities. In short, Smart says, because we approve of them (as 'special')

### Smart's Defence of Hedonism

Smart introduces the idea of the sadist. Imagine a lone figure who gets great sadistic pleasure from the idea that everyone else is suffering torture (though no one else exists). Smart's point is that whilst from a strict hedonist point of view, the sadist is happy we do approve of his happiness - most of us would think that the world would be better if people did not get pleasure from the suffering of others. But Smart leaps to the defence of hedonism - we need to distinguish between the pleasure itself and its consequences. It is only the consequences of the Sadist's pleasure that we disapprove of, but there is nothing to disapprove of in the pleasure itself in a situation where it is genuinely victimless. Smart says that no pleasure is intrinsically bad.

</br>

## Nozick and the Experience Machine

Nozick proposes the possibility of being plugged into a machine which will produce the experience of a very happy life, along with various pleasures, few pains, and great success. In this machine, we will not know that this reality is fake, and we would believe that we are actually living these experiences. The catch is, you must choose either to plug in for life, or not at all.

Nozick claims that most of us <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">would not plug in</mark>, because we value <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">being in contact with reality</mark>. Nozick says that this is not pleasure, but a relationship to something outside our minds. He goes further than Smart to say that we want <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">real</mark> achievements, not just a state of mind. Nozick concludes that we cannot understand what is good based off our subjective psychological states. If hedonism was correct, we would not hesitate to plug in.

</br>

## Preference Utilitarianism

If we accept Nozick's argument, then the question of what happiness actually is arises. Preference Utilitarianism argues that we should aim to maximise not pleasure but the satisfaction of individual preferences.

### The three arguments
1.  If Nozick is right, we prefer contact with reality over pleasure. Thus, having this preference satisfied is valuable
2.  The appeal to preferences to explain Mill's higher/lower pleasures distinction - which he explains in terms of what people prefer (see test of competent judges)
3.  The satisfaction of many of our preferences will result in pleasure, but many won't. Are the 'production of happiness' and the 'decrease of pain' morally equivalent? If people more strongly prefer not to suffer pain than to be brought pleasure, this would explain the thought that avoiding harm (pain) is the most important moral obligation.

### Unification

Preference Utilitarianism argues that it offers a more unified/comprehensive account of what is valuable than Hedonistic Utilitarianism. Pleasure is important, but only because it results from satisfying people's preferences. This simplifies Smart's theory.

</br>

## Mill's 'Proof'
</br>

Mill's 'proof' that happiness is good has three parts:

### First Stage

Mill says that we can't give a deductive or reasoned argument based off first principles. He claims that 'we should aim at what is desirable'. The basis for this 'should', Mill says, is empirical - something is desirable simply because we can observe people desiring it. No reason can be given as to why the general happiness is desirable beyond the observation that each person desire's their own happiness.

#### G.E. Moore's Objection

Moore accuses Mill of being guilty of the fallacy of equivocation. He confuses two senses of 'desirable': 'worthy' and 'capable': what is worthy of being desired and what is capable of being desired - the usual meaning is 'worthy' (anything desirable in this sense is good). But we might also use it in the sense of 'capable' - as in 'capable of being desired', and this is what it seems to mean in Mill's initial argument ('what is desirable is what people desire')

But, what is capable of being desired is not the same as what is worthy of being desired. People desire all sorts of unworthy ends. Mill has assumed that people desire what is worthy but at best his argument has only shown that they desire what they are capable of desiring.

However, Mill is not guilty of this. He argues that in general, people tend to desire happiness - this is empirical evidence that happiness is desirable. Mill suggests that there is nothing that everyone wants that is not worthy of being desired.

#### Fallacy of Composition

Mill is guilty of the fallacy of composition ('because some part has a property, therefore the whole of which it is a part has a property'). Mill seems to say that because each person desires their own happiness, it follows that everybody desires everybody's happiness. But this does not follow - hence the fallacy.

It could, however, be argued that this misrepresents Mill's argument. When Mill says that everyone desires the general happiness he means only the aggregate of everyone's happiness, not that each person desires everyone else's happiness. If so, he is not guilty of the fallacy
</br>

### Second Stage 

Here, Mill seeks to prove that happiness is the only good (and therefore the ultimate end)

It is important here to understand the difference between constitutive and external means:

-   Constitutive means are means that are part of the end itself (e.g. lying on the beach is a constitutive part of a good beach holiday)
-   External means are something that you do in order to achieve an end (but which is separable from the end (e.g. getting up early to leave is separable from having a good holiday))

Mill argues that happiness consists in knowing the truth, and therefore truth and other desirable qualities as part of happiness. 

In sum, as pleasure is happiness, we only desire happiness, and happiness is the only good.
