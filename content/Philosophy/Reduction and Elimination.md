# Reduction and Elimination
</br>

### Why does Patricia Churchland think explanation is more important than one–one identities in reduction?

Explanation is more important that one-one identities because we should focus on explaining mental properties in terms of physical properties more generally, than on identifying exact matches between the two. Mental states cannot be simply identified with singular physical states - both are complex and so require a full explanation (in order to eliminate the mental) rather than just an identity claim.

### Explain Patricia Churchland’s argument that developments in neuroscience will threaten to eliminate some mental properties

We have already rejected psychological theories from the past, e.g. our understanding of addiction has changed from the purely mental (lacking willpower) to the purely. We should expect this to continue and eventually we will be able to reject mental properties.
