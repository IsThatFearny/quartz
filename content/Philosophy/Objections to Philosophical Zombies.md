# Objections to Philosophical Zombies
</br>

### Philosophical Zombies are not conceivable


P1: A zombie is a physical duplicate of a person with phenomenal consciousness, but without phenomenal consciousness

P2: (If physicalism is true) a physical duplicate = functional duplicate

C1: Therefore, a zombie is a physical and functional duplicate of a person, but without phenomenal consciousness

P3: (if physicalism is true; this relies on the claim that there is a complete and coherent analysis of consciousness in physical/functional terms), phenomenal properties are physical properties realising a particular role

C2: Therefore, a physical and functional duplicate of a person with phenomenal consciousness has phenomenal consciousness

P4: A physical and functional duplicate of a person with consciousness cannot both have and lack phenomenal consciousness 

C3: Therefore, (if physicalism is true), zombies are inconceivable

### What is metaphysically possible tells us nothing about the actual world

The philosophical zombies argument shows, at best, that in another possible world, physical and phenomenal properties are distinct. It could just as easily be true that physicalism is true in our world.

The Property Dualist response is that the objection misunderstands identity - physical and phenomenal properties have to be the same in every possible world.
