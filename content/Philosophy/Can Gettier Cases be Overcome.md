# Can Gettier Cases be Overcome?
</br>

### 6PhiC's Initial Thoughts

- Replace 'justification' with all propositions must be based on truth/true information (no false lemmas)
- Links between justification must be watertight
- Accept JTB as knowledge, even when this knowledge appears to arise by accident
- Justification must be based on valid/reliable sources
	- Sense experience is unreliable
