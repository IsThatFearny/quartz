# MBTIT Essay Outline

</br>

#### Intro

Mind-brain type identity theory is the claim that mental properties *just are* physical properties, and that thinking a thought is exactly the same thing as certain neurons firing

#### Argument 1

- Mental states are closely linked with and dependent upon the brain, so the mind has become synonymous with the brain in the public mind
- E.g. If we remove a part of someone’s brain, then their mental state will change

#### Argument 2

- Correlation is not identity
- E.g. having a heart is correlated with having kidneys - if you have a heart, you must logically have kidneys.
- Following from the example, a heart and kidneys are distinct, separate things. The fact that a brain state is correlated with a mental state does not demonstrate that they are the same thing, as correlation is not the same as identity. 
- This claim forms the basis for Smart’s response that MBTIT is the simplest theory of physicalism - Occam’s razor. Because there are no overwhelming arguments or dualism, then we should reject the idea of non-physical substances.

#### Argument 3

- The critic of MBTIT says that it does not hold, as the identity claim is not analytically true
- However, Smart argues that it’s not meant to be analytically true, as the concepts and terms remain distinct, the claim is in the fact that these concepts refer to the same thing in the world.

#### Conclusion

- Argue for MBTIT, as overwhelming arguments in favour. Explain primary reasons for this conclusion
