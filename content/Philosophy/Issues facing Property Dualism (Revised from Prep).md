# Issues facing Property Dualism (Revised from Prep)

</br>




### What is the difference between interactionist and epiphenomenalist property dualism?

Epiphenomenalist property dualism claims that physical states cause mental states, but mental states have no causal power. This is **one-way interaction** Interactionist property dualism claims that mental and physical states interact and cause one another. This is **two-way interaction**.

### What is the conceptual interaction problem facing property dualism, and how does Chalmers refute this?

The conceptual interaction problem asks the question: how can a mental property (which is not in space) cause or interact with the physical (which *is* in space). Chalmer’s response is that we do not (and cannot) know about the fundamental laws of nature, so the objection is too vague/unsuited for the reality of our experiences. We have evidence to suggest that the mental does cause the physical; our understanding of mental states is incomplete.

### What is the empirical interaction problem facing property dualism, and how does Chalmer’s refute this?

If the mental affects the physical, then that would impact the amount of energy in the universe, which is not possible. Chalmer’s response is that quantum mechanics suggests that consciousness plays a role in physical events, consciousness therefore appears to be already a part of the energy of the universe.

### Explain the claim that epiphenomenalist property dualism allows the central claims of property dualism and physicalism to be true

Property Dualism claims that mental properties ≠ physical properties, and Physicalism claims that mental properties have no impact on the physical. Epiphenomenalist Substance Dualism agrees with both of these claims.

### Why might we argue that Epiphenomenalist Property Dualism is counter-intuitive and what response can the epiphenomenalist property dualist offer?

Our experience of mental states is that they cause other mental and physical states. Physicalism claims that all mental states are purely physical. Property Dualism argues that some mental states can be explained in physical terms but phenomenal properties cannot and do not have causal powers, e.g. what it is like to smell coffee.

### Explain the objection to epiphenomenalist property dualism from introspective self-knowledge

Traits which evolve over time are ones which contribute to survival. Epiphenomenalist Property Dualism is at odds with this, as we appear to have retained mental states which have no impact or purpose.

### How does Jackson respond to this objection?

Jackson’s response is that natural selection is more complex, as are phenomenal properties (they are more closely bound to the physical than the criticism suggests).
