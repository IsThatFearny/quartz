# Verification and Falsification (Revised from Prep)


### Explain Ayer's argument that religious language is meaningless
Ayer’s argument is as follows: 

>P1: The verification principle: all meaningful claims are either
analytic or empirically verifiable.
P2. ‘God exists’ is not analytic.
P3. ‘God exists’ is not empirically verifiable.
C1. Therefore, ‘God exists’ is not meaningful.

Because most religious language relies on the statement ‘God exists’ being meaningful, and it can be shown not to be, we can conclude that religious language is also meaningless.

#### Revised

Ayer claims that religious language is meaningless. ‘God exists’ is neither analytic nor empirically verifiable and so is meaningless. The same applies to the phrase ‘I have had an experience of God. The response to this is that this ‘experience’ cannot be empirically verified; they are literally unintelligible (William James argues that religious experiences are ineffable - i.e. indescribable/unintelligible - by nature) Since all religious language stems from this proposition, we can consider this to be meaningless as well.





The verification principle is an attempt to understand how we can know $x$ to be true. If a statement fails the verification principle, it isn’t really saying anything. For a statement to have meaning, it must be able to be verified.

### Explain Hick's concept of eschatological verification, and his argument that it establishes the meaningfulness of religious language.


**[[Philosophy/Glossary#Eschatological Verification|Eschatological Verification]]** is Hick’s understanding of verification, which posits that for a statement to be verifiable, we must remove all doubt and uncertainty through empirical means. Whilst he agrees with Ayer that ‘God exists’ is not a claim that we verify through our current experience, he argues that this is not enough to condemn religious language as meaningless. Hick’s concept of ‘eschatological verification’ is developed into verification in the afterlife or at the end of time. In believing that God exists, the theist believes that there will be unambiguous experiences of God in life after death. We can argue that this shows that ‘God exists’ is meaningful. First, it must be meaningful to speak of an afterlife. All empirically verifiable statements are conditional. However, for this to apply to the afterlife, the concept of personal existence after death must be logically possible. Second, we must be able to form some conception of what an experience of God could be. Hick argues that we already have some sense of this, since we are aware that our experience in this life is ambiguous – it doesn’t establish or disprove God’s existence. He suggests that an experience of our personal fulfilment and relation to God could serve as verification.

#### Revised

Hick’s response to Ayer is that religious claims can only be verified beyond this life - eschatological verification (i.e. pertaining to the end of the world/study of last things). To say ‘God exists’ is to accept the logical possibility and the after life. It can and will be verified when we die, whether we believe it or not.

### Explain why we might claim that it is 'common sense' to reject the verification principle, and Ayer's response.

According to the principle, its own claim is meaningless. The statement is neither analytic, nor can be verified empirically, and so it is, by virtue of itself, meaningless. Verificationism therefore gives us no reason to think that religious language is meaningless.

Ayer’s response is that the principle is a definition rather than a hypothesis about meaning. He accepts that the principle isn’t an accurate criterion for literal meaning, but this is why he provides arguments in specific cases which support it.

#### Revised

It might be common sense to reject the verification principle. For one, it reduces language about aesthetics, morality and emotions to meaningless claims. Secondly, it is self defeating: the verification principle is neither analytic nor empirically verifiable. If the verification principle is true, then the principle is a meaningless statement.

Ayer’s response to this is that the verification principle is intended to clarify what it is to say that $x$ is meaningful rather than a statement of fact in itself. It is a tool for establishing meaning, rather than a proposition like ‘God exists’

### Explain how a falsification principle of meaning might be seen to improve on the verification principle.

A claim can be said to be falsifiable if it is logically incompatible with a set of empirical observations. Therefore, a falsification principle allows us to suggest that a claim is only meaningful if it rules out some possible experience.

One advantage of falsification is how it deals with generalisations. Claims such as ‘All swans are white’ threatens to be meaningless if we apply the verification principle, because experience cannot prove it to be true. However, it is an easy claim to prove false - all we need to do is observe a black swan!

#### Revised

A claim is meaningful if it can be shown to be false. The phrase ‘all swans are white’ is easier to falsify than to verify, because all you need to do to falsify it is to find one black swan. To verify is to focus on ‘white swans’, of which there are many, whereas to falsify is to focus on non-white swans.
