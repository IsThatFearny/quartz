# How does Mill defend Bentham's Utilitarianism? (Qualitative Utilitarianism)
</br>

## Questions
</br>

### Is comparing different pleasures impossible?

- Felicific/Hedonic Calculus introduces a degree of uncertainty when you move past the individual level, due to the subjectivity of pleasure
- Mill's Qualitative Utilitarianism attempts to solve the issue of subjectivity

</br>

### Is quantity the only factor?

- Quantity is important, but quality of pleasure must also be considered
</br>

### What is the biggest factor in deciding the morality of an action its outcome/consequence or its motivation/intention?

- Quantity of pleasure
- Quality of pleasure
- Amount of people that it affects

</br>

### Does Utilitarianism support the exploitation and abuse of the minority groups if it pleases the majority?

- In theory, yes. This is because Utilitarianism is based upon the principle of 'the greatest happiness for the greatest number', and if the exploitation of the minority pleases the majority, then this condition is met
- e.g. sadistic guard - A prisoner is being abused and beaten by guards. The prisoner is in immense pain, but the guards are sadistic and enjoy it. Using act utilitarianism, the 'right' or 'good' thing to do would be to allow beating the prisoner (the minority), as it pleases the guards (the majority)

## Utilitarianism's Fundamental Principle

John Stuart Mill (1806-73) agreed with Bentham that the 'one fundamental principle... at the root of all morality' is the utility principle:

> [!note] Utility Principle
> 'Utility, or the Greatest Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended plesasure and the absence of pain; by unhappiness is intended pain and the privation of pleasure'
> ~ John Stuart Mill

### Mill's Swine Analogy

> ' Better to be a human dissatisfied, than a pig satisfied. Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisified'

Mill argues against 'swine philosophy'. If there is no higher purpose to life than the mere pursuit of pleasure, we are no different to a pig.
