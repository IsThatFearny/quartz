# Responses to Scepticism

## Descartes

 - Cogito - Even if I am being deceived, I can know that I exist
 - God is not a deceiver (see arguments for God) so I can trust my perceptions
 - Descartes adopts Indirect Realism because sense experience is not indubitable so knowledge of secondary qualities cannot be certain. Primary qualities can be understood as the concept of physical objects and thus known a priori

## Locke

- Involuntary nature of perception: we cannot choose what we perceive so there must be an external cause of our perceptions, this must be the physical objects themselves
- Coherence: our perceptions are coherent with each other, e.g. we see and hear a train coming and this coherence suggests an external world which we experience

## Russell

- The existence of the external world is the best hypothesis - scepticism cannot a better explanation for our experiences, e.g. the cat gets hungry if you donâ€™t feed it

## Berkeley

- Our experiences suggest that the external world is mind-dependent sense experience is not, therefore, an issue and does not lead to scepticism (idealism)
- We can know about the external world because we have immediate access to our ideas

## Reliabilism

- Scepticism assumes that knowledge must be infallible but instead we should see knowledge as true beliefs formed by reliable cognitive processes. As long as we have formed our beliefs in this way, we can say we have knowledge.
