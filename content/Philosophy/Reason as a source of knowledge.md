# Reason as a source of knowledge
</br>

## Key Terms

- Rationalism: The claim that facts about the external world can sometimes be known *a priori*. Innatism is a form of this

- Empiricism: The claim that facts about the external world can only be known *a posteriori*

- Analytic Truths: Propositions which are true or false in virtue of the meaning of the words, e.g. 2 + 2 = 4; a bachelor is unmarried man

- Synthetic Truths: Propositions which are true or false depending on the way the world is, e.g. the grass is green; it is raining

- Necessary Truths: A proposition is *necessarily* true if it *must* be true or false. For example, mathematical propositions such as 1 + 1 = 2 are necessarily true - it is not possible for them to be false. 

- Contingent Truths: A proposition is *contingently* true if there is a possibility that it *could* be or have been true or false. While it will be either true or false, this may change. For example, it is true currently that you are reading these notes, but it has not always been and will not always be the case, and therefore this is a contingent truth.

## What are the arguments for Innatism?

Innatism: The claim that we are born with some knowledge of synthetic propositions. This knowledge is innate in us and known *a priori*.

##### Argument 1: Meno’s slave (Plato)

In this story, Socrates asks an uneducated slave a range of maths and geometry questions, all of which the boy is able to answer without prior experience or knowledge.

Plato argues that:

- Innate knowledge is best understood as ‘recollection’
- Through dialogue and questions, people can recall innate knowledge of propositions not formally taught
- This knowledge must have been gained prior (through the external soul)
- So we have some knowledge which is with our soul at birth; it may be unconscious (we might not known we have it), but we can recall it when prompted

##### Argument 2: Leibniz on necessary truths

- Necessary truths cannot be derived from our experience, since experience only teaches us about how things are at any given moment, not truths about how things must be
- So we should regard a priori knowledge of necessary truths as innate
- We discover these truths by ‘attending carefully and methodically to what is already in our minds’
- Innate knowledge is ‘basic’ or foundational knowledge, which is explored, expressed, and built upon by sense experience. Sense experience helps us to make sense of our innate knowledge

</br>

### Experience as a trigger for Innate knowledge

Carruthers: Baby birds only need a small part of a song to be able to sing the whole of it. In this case, the knowledge is being ‘triggered’ by experience. Our brains develop in a genetically-determined way, so at a certain point in their development, children start to think in particular ways as experiences' ‘unlock’ innate knowledge. This would seem to be supported by our understanding of childhood development e.g. concept of love is ‘triggered’ by a loving and stable environment.
</br>

### Alternative empiricist accounts of knowledge of necessary truths

We acquire concepts from experience, and these help us to construct and understand necessary truths, which are analytic (remember that some rationalists want to claim that these truths are synthetic e.g. Plato).

So, analytic truths are known and worked out through logic, reason and deduction. Thus, there is nothing here that the empiricist is not claiming - rather, this supports the empiricist approach to knowledge.
</br>

### Are there innate concepts?

Propositional knowledge is formulated in terms of concepts. To understand a proposition, one needs to understand the concepts in the proposition. So, we cannot have propositional knowledge without knowledge of concepts. If propositional knowledge is innate, the concepts must also be innate.

Locke raises three objections to the claim that there are innate concepts:

1) Newborn babies have no concepts beyond their experiences in the womb
2) God is not an innate concept
3) Concepts can only be unconscious if they are lodged in our memory

Leibniz makes three responses:

1) We have a disposition to form concepts such as identity at birth - it takes time for them to be fully and explicitly formed in our minds
2) Language and concepts are not the same, not having the language to talk about God is not the same as not having the concept of a higher being
3) Innate concepts are not new or remembered - they are dispositions, which we may not always be conscious of (‘triggering’)
</br>

### Triggering innate concepts

We are pre-disposed to form particular concepts - experience is the ‘cue’ which encourages/forces our mind to develop the concept.

Locke proposes that our minds are *tabula rasa* (blank slate) at birth. Our experiences imprint knowledge on us over time. There are two sources of our ideas:

1) Sensation - experience perceived by the senses, e.g. eating cake
2) Reflection - internal operations of the mind; introspection and awareness of what the mind is doing, e.g. wishing that I had cake

</br>

### Hume’s empiricist argument

Hume distinguishes between impressions and ideas:

- Impressions: “Lively perceptions” - sensations/sense experience, both inner and outer, immediately experienced

- Ideas: present in the mind although not immediately arising from sense experience, reflection of our impressions

E.g. Hector has the impression of shame because he has not done his prep. Later, Hector is able to bring to mind the concept (idea) of shame because he once had the impression of it.

So, impressions, i.e. sense experience, are the basis of all our ideas - there are no innate ideas.

We might want to say that some of our ideas are unbounded (not constrained by the limits of reality). I can imagine things which are not real or which I have never experienced. I can create new ideas. However, ‘new’ ideas are simply compounds of existing ideas and concepts, e.g. a unicorn is a compound of a horse and a horn, which in themselves can be derived from impressions.

Examples:

- Gold Mountain: Gold + Mountain = Gold Mountain
- God: Power + Love + Wisdom x ∞ = God/Deity
- Morality: Moral judgements are based on the feelings we have towards the action e.g. murder = sad/angry

N.B. this provides a springboard for Ayer’s verification principle and emotivism

#### Criticisms

##### Does the concept of simple ideas make sense?

Empiricists claim that complex ideas can be drawn from simple ideas and impressions, e.g. Unicorn = horse + horn. However, the concept of simple ideas is unclear, since there seems to be an infinite regress of ideas, e.g. horse’s mane → individual hairs → qualities of each hair → etc.

##### Do all complex ideas relate to sense experience?

- We seem able to have some concepts without experience, e.g. an atom, Spain, etc.
- Abstract concepts are difficult to relate to direct experience, e.g. justice, impossibility, etc.
- Further, relational properties such as ‘closer to’ and ‘behind’ can be understood without reference to sense experience

##### Do some concepts have to exist in the mind before sense impressions can be properly experienced?

We must have some concept or structure in our mind before experience, in order to make sense of the experiences we have, e.g. ‘similarity’ - we have this concept and so can compare and contrast objects of experience.

#### Leibniz on ‘intellectual ideas’

- Concepts that originate in reflection are ‘intellectual ideas’
- Reflection (introspection), for Leibniz, is: ‘to reflect is simply to attend to what is within us, something that we carry with us already is not something that came from the senses.’
- He states that the following concepts are innate because we are/have experienced them: being, unity, substance, duration, change, action, perception, pleasure
- They are wider concepts which relate to our experiences and then reflect and connect to these concepts, e.g. change = leaves going brown; getting taller; these are both types of change that we recognise as change.

##### Response to Leibniz

Locke: Our capacities are innate, but our concepts of them are not.

To develop concepts, we have to experience our mind and its activities. So instead of becoming aware of the innate concept of change from seeing leaves turning brown, we derive the concept of change from our experience. 

However, there are innate concepts that do not seem to come from reflecting on our nature (e.g. impossibility). There are two explanations for this: either these play a role in innate knowledge; or these are analytic concepts we can work out using our ability to reason


## What is the intuition and deduction thesis?

If we assume that innatism is false, a rationalist must show that there are some synthetic propositions which can be known through rational intuition and deduction (a priori).

Rationalism: Some facts about the external world can be known a priori

Empiricism: All facts about the external world are known a posteriori

Hume claimed that if a proposition is not either true by definition or known through experience, then it is meaningless.

### The Cogito

##### Empiricist responses

- We know we are thinking by experience - we experience ourselves as thinking things, and reflecting on our thoughts is how we experience ourselves
- Thinking only ever occurs at this moment - this does not suggest that I am a continuous being
- The evil demon can presumably deceive us about our thoughts and process of thinking - so Descartes’ argument could also be subject to deception
