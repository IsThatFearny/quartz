# Essays with Michael Lacewing

</br>

### 3 Marker

A three marker can be answered fully using glossary definitions. Precision is key.

#### Example

Idealism is the claim that physical objects (and their properties) are bundles of mind-dependent ideas. 

### 5 Marker

A five marker is a single bullet point on the specification, e.g. Outline the tripartite view of knowledge. Must be precise and logically structured.

#### Example 1

P1: God is supremely good (omnibenevolent)
P2: God is omnipotent
P3: If God is omnibenevolent and omnipotent, then God would not allow evil to exist
P4: Evil exists
C1: God does not exist

Write this in a narrative form, and this is worth 5 marks.

#### Example 2

Direct realism fails to overcome the argument from perceptual variation, which showed that some properties of physical objects may change according to circumstances. Locke makes this distinction, labelling the properties affected by perceptual variation as ‘secondary qualities’, and those that are unaffected ‘primary qualities’. Primary qualities (e.g. shape, extension, etc.) are fixed and constant, whereas secondary qualities (colour, temperature, etc.) are fleeting and variable. Secondary qualities are mind-dependent, and only exist while being experienced. Primary qualities are mind-independent, and exist inherently within the object.

### 12 Marker

1) Two five-markers + 2 marks for integration, e.g. Explain Act Utilitarianism and the objection from moral integrity.
2) One long argument or compare and contrast, e.g. Explain Descartes’ proof of the external world.

##### Structure

1) 5 Marker
2) Link
3) 5 Marker
4) Apply - If the objection succeeds, it shows that the theory is wrong because…

### 25 Marker

Top band essays (highlighted criteria are dominant):

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Detailed and precise understanding</mark>
- Clear intent throughout
- Logic of overall argument is sustained throughout 
- Clear conclusion
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Arguments supporting conclusion are in strongest form</mark>
- Counter arguments are in strongest form
- Arguments in support are robustly defended
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Arguments/counterarguments are weighted</mark>
- Crucial arguments are identified
- Precise language

Basic structure should be:

Introduction
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A</mark>rgument
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">C</mark>ounterargument
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">E</mark>valuation (Weighting)

Conclusion

ACE paragraphs should be ordered from weakest to strongest.
