# Perceptual Variation and Indirect Realism (Revised from Prep)
</br>


## 1) Explain the argument from perceptual variation as a criticism of direct realism (5 marks)

Perceptual variation argues that, in any given circumstance, an object may look different  to an different observer. For example, Bertrand Russel proposed the brown table. From one angle, the table may look a shade of brown, however from another angle the table may look white (due to the light reflecting onto it). We therefore can't say that the table is brown. This criticises Direct Realism, as in this scenario a Direct Realist would have to say that the table is brown or white for certain, however this interpretation would depend on their perspective and the light's reflection, and therefore Direct Realism does not hold.

## 2) Read pages 79-83 of the textbook and answer all the questions in the margin, ignoring the argument map

### What are Sense-Data?

Sense-Data are mental representations of objects which are true to our perception. Sense-Data are private and entirely subjective to the agent, as opposed to physical objects which are 'public'. In addition to this, sense-data can only exist while being experienced, in contrast to physical objects which do not have to be experienced to exist.

### Explain the argument from non-veridical perception to indirect realism

There are many experiences in which what we experience does not correlate with the properties of physical objects. In such cases, given that what we perceive does not correlate with reality, we must be experiencing sense-data rather than the physical object itself. These cases are indistinguishable from veridical perception. When two experiences are indistinguishable, they are perceptual experiences of the same thing, therefore we always perceive sense data. Nonetheless, it still makes sense to say that we perceive 'the world'. In both cases of veridical perception and illusion. Sense-data is caused by and represents physical objects. This may be accurate or inaccurate. We can therefore conclude that we perceive physical objects indirectly, through sense data.


### Explain and illustrate the difference between primary and secondary qualities

John Locke proposed that we can separate perceived properties into two types: Primary and Secondary qualities. Locke defines a quality as a 'power' that a physical object has 'to produce an idea in our mind'. He goes on to argue that Primary qualities are 'utterly inseparable' from the physical object. No matter what conditions we perceive the object in, it will always have these qualities. Locke's primary qualities are extension, size, shape, motion, number and solidity. Secondary qualities are qualities that physical objects have that are 'nothing but powers to produce various sensations in us'. Locke says that these include colours, sounds, temperature, tastes, smells, etc.

The primary distinction between the two is the phrase used by Locke, 'nothing but'. This means that, while primary qualities can also produce various sensations, secondary qualities can only do this under certain conditions. Colour, for example, can only produce a sensation in us when it is seen.


### Explain why, for Locke, solidity is a primary quality

Locke makes sure to define solidity as the quality of a physical object whereby it takes up space and excludes other physical objects from occupying said space. For Locke, this is a primary quality because, no matter the changes something goes through (whether it be a solid, liquid, or a gas - our primary definition of solidity), solidity will always hold true.

##### Revised

- When an object takes up space and excludes other physical objects from that space
- It is a primary quality because it is fixed and an object will always take up some space (be 'solid')

### Explain and illustrate what Locke means by 'resemblance'

Locke argues that our experiences 'resemble' primary qualities of an object (Secondary qualities are not resembled by our experience as they are subjective depending on circumstance). This is because primary qualities are affected by the physical object's properties such as atomic and molecular structure, and we can therefore trust them to give a resemblance of what the physical object is.

##### Revised

Our experiences of primary qualities resemble the primary qualities of the object. This contrasts with secondary qualities, which do not resemble the object in the same way. Therefore, all we can know about the object is it's primary qualities.
