# Non-hedonistic Utilitarianism
</br>

## a) Is pleasure the only good? Smart on hedonistic and non-hedonistic Utilitarianism

</br>

### Explain Smart's characterisation of G.E. Moore as an 'ideal' utilitarian
G.E. Moore believed that certain states of mind, such as knowledge, are also 'good' as well as pleasure. This is opposed to Bentham's hedonism.

##### Revised
Moore rejects the argument that pleasure is the only good (therefore he is not a hedonist). Instead, he is an 'ideal' utilitarian in the sense that there are other states of mind (in addition to pleasure) such as knowledge

</br>

### Explain Smart's agreement with Mill (against Bentham) that pleasures are not all equal, with reference to the 'electrodes in the brain' scenario
Smart agrees with Mill with the concept of 'better a human satisfied than a pig dissatisfied', referring to a scenario in which you are wired up with electrodes. At the press of a button, these electrodes will provide you with intense sensual pleasure, with no ill effects. Smart then goes on to ask what would we think of this, and would we condemn it as forsaking 'higher' pleasures?

##### Revised
The 'electrodes in the brain' scenario - at the press of a button the electrodes cause experience of intense sensory pleasure (i.e. Bentham's aim) and no concomitant pain. Would we say, Smart asks, that this is the ideal? Is this what we would prefer? Bentham's answer would have to be 'yes' Smart points out, Mill and Moore would both answer 'no': because we would prefer a life of greater variation in which there is scope for the satisfaction of thought, feeling and imagination
</br>

### Explain Smart's disagreement with Mill over the issue of the quality of pleasure, and the interpretation of the higher/lower distinction that results
Smart claims that Mill is not a pure hedonist. Mill's view can only defend the place of higher pleasures in terms of their fecundity. Smart says that Mill's concept of happiness is evaluative. Happiness is pleasure of which we approve. This interprets 'higher' pleasures as not higher at all ^805635

##### Revised
Yet, Smart proceeds to distinguish a position distinct from Mill as well. Smart's point about how we respond to the 'electrodes' scenario is that what is important is not so much the quality of the pleasure (as Mill thinks) , but our attitude towards the pleasure. To say 'Hannah is happy' - and not merely contented - is to express approval of their pleasures involved in Hannah's happiness. Mill rejects this analysis - for Mill, moral approval is irrelevant when we are judging higher and lower pleasures. But smart  says that approval is integral to our judgements about pleasures - and so Mill's hedonism is not a version of 'pure' hedonism at all, as pure hedonism argues that pleasure is the only good - 'higher' pleasures are simply those that are both fecund and intense. But this is not Mill's position, Smart points out - Mill introduces an evaluative/qualitative element according to which some pleasures are higher not because of intensity/fecundity but instead because they help us realise our unique emotional/intellectual capabilities. In short, Smart says, because we approve of them (as 'special')
</br>

### Explain Smart's defence of hedonism
Smart defends hedonism by saying that no pleasure is intrinsically bad, and it is only ever bad if it causes pain to oneself or others

##### Revised
Mill and Bentham argue that pleasure is the only good, but imagine a lone figure who gets great sadistic pleasure from the idea that everyone else is suffering torture (though no one else exists). Smart's point is that whilst from a strict hedonist point of view, the sadist is happy we do approve of his happiness - most of us would think that the world would be better if people did not get pleasure from the suffering of others. But Smart leaps to the defence of hedonism - we need to distinguish between the pleasure itself and its consequences. It is only the consequences of the Sadist's pleasure that we disapprove of, but there is nothing to disapprove of in the pleasure itself in a situation where it is genuinely victimless (as in the scenario). This, Smart defends hedonism - no pleasure is intrinsically bad, though we might disapprove of its consequences 

Key point: Smart pulls apart the simple 'happiness = pleasure' formula
</br>

## b) Nozick's experience machine

</br>

### Summarise Nozick's 'experience machine'

Nozick proposes the possibility of being plugged into a machine which will produce the experience of a very happy life, along with various pleasures, few pains, and great success. In this machine, we will not know that this reality is fake, and we would believe that we are actually living these experiences. The catch is, you must choose either to plug in for life, or not at all.

##### Revised
In the electrode scenario, Smart contrasts our desire for pleasure and our desire for achievement, and then speaks of happiness as not only contentment, but contentment of which we approve. But does this explain our desire for achievement?

Imagine a machine capable of simulating a very happy life, with many/varied pleasures, few pains and much sense of achievement. And if we plug in we won't know that we're plugged in - we'll take it for reality. But we must plug i for life or not at all 
</br>

### Explain Nozick's argument against hedonism based on the claim that most of us would not plug in

Nozick argues that the majority would not take this chance, as we value being in contact with reality, despite the possible loss of happiness. Nozick says that we cannot quantify nor qualify this as 'pleasure', and instead it is a relation to something outside our minds. Nozick agrees with Smart that we want achievements, but goes further to say that we want 'real' achievements, and not the state of mind of achievement. Nozick therefore concludes that we cannot understand what is good based off our subjective psychological states.

##### Revised
Nozick argues that most would not plug in - why? Because it is not real - we value being in contact with reality, even though that may lead to fewer pleasures and failures. Nozick is arguing that happiness is not reducible to a psychological state (i.e. happiness is not merely pleasure); it is a relation to something beyond our minds - we not only want achievements, we want real achievements. So Nozick's argument is an argument against hedonism - there is more to the good life than pleasure, he argues. If hedonism was true, we would not hesitate to plug in. We don't, so there must be more to life than pleasure.
</br>

## c) Preference Utilitarianism

</br>

### What is Preference Utilitarianism?

Preference Utilitarianism is a form which argues that we should aim to maximise the satisfaction of desires/preferences, not pleasure

##### Revised

If we accept Nozick's argument and so the claim that pleasure is not the only good ('key to happiness') - then what is happiness? Preference Utilitarianism is a type of non-hedonistic Utilitarianism arguing that what we should maximise is not pleasure but the satisfaction of individual preferences.
</br>

### Summarise the three arguments for Preference Utilitarianism

1) Having a preference satisfied is valuable, but not necessarily because it brings us pleasure. For a preference to be satisfied, it must be satisfied in reality
2) Preference explains Mill's 'higher and lower pleasures' claim. What people prefer is of more value to them.
3) Preference satisfaction is not based upon pleasure, as many preferences will not bring us pleasure (e.g. after death, etc.). If more people prefer the absence of plain to the existence of pleasure, then it can be considered important not to cause harm

##### Revised
1) If Nozick is right, we prefer contact with reality over pleasure. Thus, having this preference satisfied is valuable
2) The appeal to preferences to explain Mill's higher/lower pleasures distinction - which he explains in terms of what people prefer (see test of competent judges)
3) The satisfaction of many of our preferences will result in pleasure, but many won't. Are the 'production of happiness' and the 'decrease of pain' morally equivalent? If people more strongly prefer not to suffer pain than to be brought pleasure, this would explain the thought that avoiding harm (pain) is the most important moral obligation.
</br>

### Summarise the claim that Preference Utilitarianism offers a more unified account of what is valuable than Hedonistic Utilitarianism, and that it simplifies Smart's theory

Preference Utilitarianism allows us to claim that happiness is the only good with the understanding that happiness is defined as one's preferences being satisfied. Pleasure is important when it is a result of satisfied preferences

Smart's theory does not define happiness in terms of what is 'good', whereas Preference Utilitarianism can say that what is good is maximising preference satisfaction. Approval is not relevant at all.

##### Revised
In summary: Preference Utilitarianism argues that it offers a more unified/comprehensive account of what is valuable than Hedonistic Utilitarianism. Pleasure is important, but only because it results from satisfying people's preferences - i.e. Preference Utilitarianism argues that preference is more fundamental than pleasure. 

As such, it simplifies Smart's theory which places emphasis on approval over mere hedonistic pleasure by claiming that the only way of explaining why we might approve of $x$ is by saying that it satisfies a preference
</br>

## d) Mill's 'Proof' of Utilitarianism
</br>

Since we can't produce a deductive (as in maths) of what is good, we have to appeal to evidence. Mill's 'proof' that happiness is good has three parts:
</br>

### Explain the first stage of Mill's 'proof' of the utility principle, that happiness is good, with reference to the difficulty of proof in ethics, the claim that 'we should aim at what is desirable'; the three stages of the argument
</br>

Proving whether $x$ is 'good' is difficult, Mill says, because we can't deduce it from first principles as we might in, say, maths. The reason being that the first principle in ethics is the answer to the question 'what is good?'. Still, Mill says, we can give a reasoned argument.

Mill claims, we 'should aim at what is desirable' - what is the basis for this 'should'? Mill offers an empirical justification: $x$ is desirable because people desire it - that is to say, we observe people desiring it

No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable beyond the observation (evidence!) that each person desires their own happiness

This being a fact we have all the proof that it is possible to acquire that happiness is a good: that each person's happiness is a good to that person, therefore a general good

</br>

### Explain G.E. Moore's objection to Mill's proof, and a possible response to it

Moore says that Mill is guilty of the fallacy of equivocation (i.e. he confuses two meanings of the same word). Specifically, he confuses two senses of 'desirable': 'worthy' and 'capable': what is worthy of being desired and what is capable of being desired - the usual meaning is 'worthy' (anything desirable in this sense is good). But we might also use it in the sense of 'capable' - as in 'capable of being desired', and this is what it seems to mean in Mill's initial argument ('what is desirable is what people desire')

But, what is capable of being desired is not the same as what is worthy of being desired (i.e. what is 'good'). People desire all sorts of unworthy ends. Mill has assumed that people desire what is worthy (i.e. worthy) but at best his argument has only shown that they desire what they are capable of desiring. 

Reply to Moore:  Mill is not guilty as charged: Mill asks what evidence is there for thinking that something is worthy of being desired? He argues that in general people desire happiness - which is good evidence that happiness is desirable. Is there evidence that there is something everyone wants that is not worthy of being desired? There is no such evidence, Mill suggests, only evidence of the contrary.
</br>

### Explain the objection that Mill's proof commits the fallacy of composition, and a possible response to it

Mill is guilty of the fallacy of composition ('because some part has a property, therefore the whole of which it is a part has a property'). Mill seems to say that because each person desires their own happiness, it follows that everybody desires everybody's happiness. But this does not follow - hence the fallacy

Mill might respond that this misrepresents his argument: when Mill says that everyone desires the general happiness he means only the aggregate of everyone's happiness, not that each person desires everyone else's happiness. If so, he is not guilty of the fallacy
</br>

### Explain the second stage of Mill's 'proof' of the utility principle, that happiness is the only good, with reference to the distinction between external constitutive means; and Mill's use of this distinction in  that the only good is happiness 

Mill is here seeking to prove that happiness is the only good (and so the ultimate end of all action). 

It is important to understand the distinction between external and constitutive means:
- Constitutive means are means that are part of the end itself (e.g. lying on the beach is a constitutive part of a good beach holiday)
- External means are something that you do in order to achieve an end (but which is separable from the end (e.g. getting up early to leave is separable from having a good holiday))

Thus, Mill argues that happiness consists in knowing the truth - so constitutive - and therefore truth and other desirable qualities are part of happiness.

In other words, whatever we desire for its own sake - e.g. truth - is part of what happiness is, for us. Why believe this? Mill's answer tis that to desire $x$ 'just is' to find $x$ pleasant. It is a contradiction to desire $x$ if you don't find it pleasurable. 

In sum, as pleasure is happiness, we only desire happiness, and happiness is the only good.

</br>

### Does Mill Succeed in showing that happiness is the only good?

Note how Mill's argument differs from Smart and Preference Utilitarianism, which contest Mill's conclusion - disagreeing with the 'pleasure = happiness' bit
