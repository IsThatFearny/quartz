# Philosophical Behaviourism Final Thoughts + Initial Issues

### Explain Ryle’s claim that there is nothing essentially private about thinking

Ryle claims that thinking to ourselves is simply *internalised speaking*. Speaking, he argues, is an overt behaviour, and we only acquire the ability to think with effort. The fact that we are speaking only with ourselves and the resulting silence is inessential to the nature of thinking. Whether the process is public or private is irrelevant to whether it is thinking. Processes that take place silently don’t define thinking any more than those that take place as publicly observable behaviours.

#### Revised

Thinking is often not a separate process from ‘doing’ - it is linked with actions and behaviours, e.g. Mrs Fairley is annoyed with Will (thought) –> Mrs Fairley has an angry tone and a disappointed face (action). Thoughts without actions are not essentially private, since they can be publicly available - they do not belong in the head or have real existence.

### Explain, with reference to category mistakes, why Ryle rejects both MBTIT and Eliminative Materialism

Analysis of our mental concepts demonstrates that they do not work in the same way as our physical concepts - physical explanations use categorical concepts, whereas mental concepts are dispositional. Thus, Ryle argues that both MBTIT and Eliminative Materialism make category mistakes: MBTIT equates the physical with the mental (and if the two have different properties then they cannot be the identical); Eliminative Materialism does likewise.

#### Revised

Mental concepts are in a different category from physical concepts. MBTIT and Eliminative Materialism make a category mistake in treating mental concepts as physical concepts.

### Explain why philosophical behaviourism is a form of physicalism

Philosophical behaviourism is a form of physicalism because it argues that there is no distinct psychological reality. Not because the theory eliminates them, but because questions about the mind are not the same as questions about what exists - these are answered by natural science. For Ryle, dispositions aren’t additional properties, and are expressed in hypothetical statements rather than categorical ones. Therefore, saying ‘if this happens, then this will happen’ doesn't state anything about what exists, and Philosophical Behaviourism is a physicalist theory.

### Summarise philosophical behaviourism in no more than 250 words

Philosophical behaviourism is the theory that the meaning of mental concepts can be analysed in terms of ‘behaviour’. Because it rejects the notion of a distinct psychological reality, and argues that talking about mental states is not the same as talking about what exists, it is a form of physicalism. Hempel’s ‘hard’ behaviourism posits that the meaning of a statement is established by the conditions of its verification. Thus, statements using mental states can be translated into statements about the conditions of verifying such claims using behaviour. Ryle argues for a form of ‘soft’ behaviourism, arguing that mental states can be understood as behavioural dispositions (dispositions being how something will or is likely to behave under certain circumstances). Dispositions that are mental states Ryle says to be ‘infinitely heterogenous’. Statements using mental concepts work at a higher level of generality than individual statements about behaviour. Ryle also argues that thinking is either part of what it is to act thoughtfully, or alternatively internalised speech. Thinking is not necessarily private.
