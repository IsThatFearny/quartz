# Medieval Worlds Lecture 2 - Which Medieval Worlds, Where?


- Does 'Medieval' hold a purely historical significance? Perhaps not a periodisation that should be argued for, just a convenient term
- Middle ages usually characterised as (roughly) the millennium between c.500 CE and c.1500 CE
- Medieval = *medium* (Latin for 'middle') + *aevum* (Latin for 'age')
- Lines are often blurred between periods - no absolute breaks in reality, historians create breaks to in order to divide history
- Definition is negative - neither ancient nor renaissance/modernity
- Conception of the 'middle ages' began with the renaissance, who defined the period that they were coming out of as medieval
- See Petrarchan conception of 'the dark ages' and 'the middle ages'

> [!NOTE] Petrarch (mid 14th c.)
> "But if, as I wish and ardently hope, you shall live on after me, a better age will come again: this ignorant stupor surely can't last forever. Perhaps when the dark clouds are lifted, our descendants might enjoy once more the radiance which the ancients knew."


#### Eurocentrism

- Medievalism is a eurocentric periodisation
- Bound up with ideas of loss of knowledge and 'civilised society', an age of ignorance, faith, violence, etc.
- Often seen as the origins of modern European nationhood and nation states, and the roots of the rise of the west to dominance
- 'The west' inherits Roman culture and intellectual knowledge, rather than that of the middle east
