### Original


However, the argument must be made that the original view is invalid: not only were agricultural policies a social failure, they also failed economically, and so were a failure outright. Socially, evidence of failure is rife: only 20% of households remained collectivised by October 1930 following a return to voluntary collectivisation. Stalin’s target of 25% had not been met, a clear failure in policy’ the policy of dekulakisation, an attempt to make the agricultural sector more socialist and less competitive, ended up remove 10,000,000 of the best farmers, which stunted agriculutral growth - another failure; and from 1932-33, Russia experienced the worst famines history. And this failure was not limited to hindsight: 100,000 red army troops had to be sent to put down a series of revolts in the Tambov region in 1920. The peasants were experiencing firsthand the effects of the social failure of agricultural policy, and were displeased about it. Economic success was only partially existent. Despite small gains being made, agriculture had failed to make much progress since Tsarist times. In Spring 1918, there was a grain crisis, and later in the period the citizens of Petrograd subsisted on a mere 50g of bread per day. The scissors crisis of 1923 exemplified agricultural failure: industrial prices soared, whereas agricultural prices remained very low. Further, approximately 30% of cattle, pigs, and sheep were slaughtered in 1929-30, causing a livestock crisis (these animals were slaughtered for fear of the ‘kulak’ label). From these facts, it is evident that the agricultural sector was stagnating, and Lenin and Stalin’s policies aiming to improve the economic and social condition of Russia had well and truly failed altogether.

### Redrafted

The argument can also be made that Lenin and Stalin’s agricultural policies failed outright, both in their economic and social consequences. Socially, there is clear evidence of failure in policy: only 20% of households remained collectivised by October 1930 following a return to voluntary collectivisation. Economic growth was severely hindered by this, as Stalin’s centralised command economy revolved around the idea of the collective farm, and was doomed to failure without a large number of them - additionally, Stalin’s target of 25% had not been met, a clear failure in policy; dekulakisation, an attempt to make the agricultural sector more socialist and less competitive, ended up removing 10,000,000 of the best farmers. This stunted the growth of the agriculture sector significantly, and the standards of living for Kulaks, who were persecuted and either sent to gulags or simply shot, declined massively; and from 1932-33, Russia experienced the worst famine in her history. Food was scarce, and as a result, the rate of economic growth and standards of living decreased substantially, because peasants could not afford to feed themselves, let alone produce surplus for requisitioning, meaning that urban workers did not have enough to eat and were unproductive. This is all clear evidence of negative social consequences, and this evidence is not the product of hindsight: 100,000 red army troops had to be sent to put down a series of revolts in the Tambov region in 1920, in which the peasants demanded food and improved living conditions. The peasants were experiencing firsthand the effects of the social failure of agricultural policy, and their willingness to revolt against it demonstrates a clear failure of policy. Additionally, economic success was only partially existent, and the negative consequences of agricultural policy in this regard far outweigh the positives. Despite small gains being made, agriculture had failed to make much progress since Tsarist times. In Spring 1918, there was a grain crisis, and later in the period the citizens of Petrograd subsisted on a mere 50g of bread per day. This limited industrial production, as urban workers could not eat enough, and so economic growth was limited. The scissors crisis of 1923 exemplified agricultural failure: industrial prices soared, whereas agricultural prices remained very low. Such a disparity in prices demonstrates a clear failure, despite such industrial growth. Agriculture was falling behind, the opposite of the intentions of Lenin and Stalin. Further, approximately 30% of cattle, pigs, and sheep were slaughtered in 1929-30, causing a livestock crisis (these animals were slaughtered for fear of the ‘kulak’ label). Grain, meat, and milk supplies were already low, and this slaughter exacerbated this crisis. Thus, food was even more scarce than before, and living conditions declined due to this. From these facts, it is evident that the agricultural sector was stagnating, and Lenin and Stalin’s policies aiming to improve the economic and social condition of Russia had well and truly failed altogether.
