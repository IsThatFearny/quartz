The 1806 Foreign Slave Trade Act was also a major turning point in the struggle for abolition, as it abolished two-thirds of the British slave trade, and in turn strengthened the campaign for the full abolition of the slave trade in 1807.[^3] During the War of the Fourth Coalition, it was realised by the British that the trade of slaves under neutral flags, especially that of the USA, was prolonging the enemy’s resistance.[^71] It was therefore decided that this economic lifeline must be cut off if there were to be any chance of victory. The 1806 Foreign Slave Trade act was the manifestation of this decision, prohibiting British subjects from trading or assisting in the trade of slaves to colonies and foreign countries.[^72] This severely affected the neutral slave trade: many ships flying under American flags were built in British shipyards, now an illegal action.[^76] The Foreign Slave Trade Act was a turning point not only because it abolished two-thirds of the slave trade, but also because it led to a different perspective on abolition, of patriotism rather than economic interest. Campaigning for abolition became patriotic, a necessity in winning the war. The 1806 act is argued to have outweighed the role of humanitarianism: Anstey claims that the humanitarian aspect was downplayed in parliamentary speeches in favour of the patriotic.[^74] The act had ramifications into the future, laying the groundwork for the 1807 Slave Trade Act - Burton goes so far as to argue that the 1806 act was more practically important than the 1807 act because of the extent of its impact - and the new attitude that the British public and parliament had on abolition would have great influence on the success of the abolition campaign in the future, both in 1807 and 1833.[^75] Whilst the argument has a limitation, namely there is substantial evidence of an illegal American slave trade, which undermines the effectiveness of the act, this had little bearing on any changes in attitudes, and so it can be argued that the 1806 Foreign Slave Trade Act was an important turning point in the struggle for abolition.[^77]
