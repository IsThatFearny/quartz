Lord Mansfield's ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case of 1772 was a key turning point in the struggle to abolish slavery in the British Empire. However, other events also served as important moments in this fight, and these must also be taken into consideration when assessing whether the ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case was the most important turning-point in the period, leading to the abolition of slavery in the British empire in 1838. Major events such as the formation of the anti-slave trade movement by the Quakers, the Slave Trade Act of 1807, the Haitian revolution (along with various other slave revolts), and the Great Reform Act of 1832 are also contenders for the 'most important' turning point in the lead up to the abolition of slavery. In this essay, I shall analyse these turning points and conclude whether Lord Mansfield's ruling was indeed the most important turning point, or whether this title should be held by another event which is perhaps more deserving.

Lord Mansfield's ruling in the Somerset Vs Stewart case of 1772 was indubitably an important moment in the process of abolishing slavery. The case set a legal precedent master could not remove a slave from the country without the consent of that slave, and that a slave could secure a writ of *habeus corpus* to prevent said removal[^1]. There had been multiple precursors to the Somerset case: Butts Vs Penny, Chamberlain Vs Harvey, Smith Vs Brown and Cooper, and R Vs Stapylton, to name but a few. The cases of Chamberlain Vs Harvey and Smith Vs Brown and Cooper were both presided over by Chief Justice Sir John Holt, and are considered to be direct predecessors to the Somerset Ruling: Holt's ruling in Smith Vs Brown and Cooper was that "as soon as a negro comes into England, he becomes free; one may be a villein in England, but not a slave"[^2] -- this unfortunately did not abolish slavery in Britain, as Holt proceeded to establish a legal mechanism for selling slaves in the UK based upon unofficial advice to the claimant[^3]; and the judgement of the court in Chamberlain vs Harvey was that a slave could not be cheated as chattel, but was instead a sort of "bound apprentice"[^4]. Therefore, whilst predecessors, these rulings did not have the same effect as *Somerset*. The reason why this was a turning point, rather than simply another ineffective ruling, was that. whilst technically Mansfield only ruled on the two specific parts of the law mentioned previously, the ruling was seen by many contemporaries as effectively the abolition of slavery in Britain. Some went further, suggesting that the case could be the basis for the abolition of slavery in the British colonies too[^5], based upon the idea that the laws of England travelled with Englishmen, and thus the law could be applied on any British settlements in the same way as in Britain[^6]. Mansfield's comments on the ruling certainly seem to imply that this was his viewpoint: "the state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political... it is so odious that nothing can be suffered to support it but positive law"[^7]. The reason that Mansfield did not declare a prohibition of chattel slavery altogether was fear of political division and distrust in the court system[^8]. Granville Sharp had intended to use it as a test case to set a precedent and to effectively outlaw slavery in Britain, and Somerset's case certainly lived up to Sharp's expectations. As the highest judge presiding at the highest common law court in the land, anything that Mansfield ruled would be set as precedent for any similar future cases. Thus, ruling that James Somerset was to go free allowed for other individuals and their representatives across the country to plead their case before the courts, citing Somerset Vs Stewart as precedent. This was very important, as the ability to cite the case was a legal framework created by Mansfield in order to do "as much damage to the legitimacy of the slaveowners\' position as possible, short of an outright ruling against them"[^9]. Appeals to the court continued in Britain and the United States for the next century[^10]. This was of significance to the eventual abolition of slavery in 1838 because it formed the basis for the gradual emancipation of slaves in Britain and in the colonies. *Somerset* reframed the debate on slavery in Britain. Even minimal gains of civil rights contributed to positive public opinion, and a growing abolitionist movement. The importance of the Somerset case as a turning point, however, is limited, because whilst many made attempts to appeal against their status, few were successful, and slaves continued to be recaptured and transported back to British colonies from British soil without being able to appeal their case[^11]. Whilst the Somerset case certainly set an important legal basis for the foundations of the abolition of the slave trade and later slavery itself, its lack of frequent practical use and the fact that it was largely ignored by slave traders of the time causes me to conclude that it is not the most important turning point in the struggle to abolish slavery in the British empire.

The Slave Trade Act of 1807 was an act of parliament that abolished the British slave trade. Whilst it did not abolish slavery altogether, and those who were already enslaved remained so, it did serve to entirely abolish the trade of slaves. This broke the cycle of the slave trade, which was a major aspect of the British economy at the time. Previously, the British would buy slaves from Africa and ship them to the Caribbean; offload them and take loads of sugar and other important goods; sail back to Britain to sell the sugar; and then use this money to buy more slaves. This process would then be repeated and would bring major profits to the traders. The importance of sugar to the economy cannot be understated. By 1775, the share of British imports that originated in the Caribbean, the vast majority of which was sugar (making up 90% of Jamaica's exports[^12]) was 28.7%[^13], and Caribbean planters were making Â£3,235,000 per annum from slave-worked sugar plantations[^14]. The Slave Trade Act marked a major departure from this method and the profits that it created -- it was a major turning point in the struggle for the abolition of the slave trade in 1838. Britain found herself using limited resources. No more slaves could be imported to work the plantations, and therefore it was only a matter of time before this huge economic benefit was lost, as slave mortality rates were staggeringly high. We can see this in the fact that consumption of sugar per capita was halved between 1801 and 1840[^15]. This was due to the rising price, and poorer families, who had considered sugar to be a necessity, were priced out. Suddenly, what was once Britain's most frequently imported good became a rarity, affordable only by the wealthy, and it made little economic sense to continue to farm and import it from plantations whose profits were rapidly falling. This meant that the British public and politicians no longer had a vested interest in slavery and its exports, and so the abolitionist cause was bolstered. It was simply becoming too expensive to run plantations for it to be economically viable, even with slave labour. Slavery could no longer be justified, its immorality no longer looked past. The official policy post-1807 was the amelioration and gradual emancipation of the slave, which subsequently was changed to full emancipation by 1831[^16]. Anti-slavery groups grew significantly, and by 1933 1.3 million people had appended their names to anti-slavery petitions, equivalent to one in 15 of the United Kingdom's population[^17]. This had a major impact on the emancipation in 1838, as popular disapproval was a major reason for abolition. The 1807 Slave Trade Act was clearly a major catalyst in the struggle to abolish slavery altogether in the British colonies, contributing almost solely to the decline of British sugar imports, therefore significantly reducing the value of the colonies to Britain and furthering the abolition campaign. Thus, the 1807 Slave Trade Act was one of, if not the most important turning point in the struggle for abolition.

Another major turning point in the struggle for abolition was that of the Haitian (St. Domingue) revolution of 1791. The only successful slave revolt of its kind, the Haitian population (albeit after a lengthy civil war) were able to establish an entirely free state. In said civil war, British garrisons fought against the rebels, led by Toussaint Louverture, in a decade-long conflict which resulted in a British defeat. Previously, slave revolts were relatively benign; the British government defeated them with relative ease, and none were successful. This defeat at the hands of those whom the British government considered 'inferior' was not only humiliating, but also served as a warning of the danger of discontented slaves. The British government and those with vested interest in the slave trade and slavery itself were petrified of a slave revolt -- it was the stuff of nightmares. They had a 'dread of insurrection'[^18] because they knew that not only would they lose assets in the mutinous colonies, but any form of uprising would also spark unrest elsewhere. This is evident in the case of Jamaica, where the Jamaican militia was called out to prevent an uprising, despite not having been assembled for any reason in the previous nine years[^19]. On St. Domingue itself, the British government provided very little protection, save for several warships and weaponry, for the colonists (many of whom were French) until their hand was forced by the impending war with France in 1793[^20]. British hesitance to intervene was due to a run-down armed forces, and the period of peaceful prosperity that Britain was experiencing. The unwillingness to jeopardize this in what should have been an easy conflict demonstrates both how tenuous Britain's grip on the colonies was, and how much they knew would have to be sacrificed in order to keep their colony. The potential economic cost and loss of life was too great to be worthwhile. Other slave revolts such as the First Maroon War in 1728 had demonstrated this before, but the success of the Haitian revolution served to demonstrate this even more clearly. It marked a major turn in public and government attitudes towards the slave trade and slavery as a whole: the abolitionist movement was able to use this revolution as an argument for abolishing the slave trade: not only was it immoral, but the resources required to prevent slave uprisings were too great for it to be worthwhile. This logic appealed to many, and when taken into consideration with the declining output of the colonies, was a major factor in changing the British public's opinion on the matter. The St. Domingue slave revolt was therefore an important turning point in the struggle for the abolition of the Slave Trade.

The role of religion in the anti-slavery movement cannot be understated, and a major turning point came in the founding of the first anti-slavery organisation by the Quakers. The Quaker movement had previously written an anti-slavery statement in 1688 in Germantown, Pennsylvania (based upon strong religious condemnation and ethical concerns), and records show that English quakers began to express their disapproval and promote reforms as early as 1727: the London Yearly Meeting of Quakers held the opinion that âis the sense of this Meeting that the importing of Negroes from their native country and relations by Friends is not a commendable nor allowable practiceâ¦ and that practice is censured by this Meetingâ[^21]. Further resolutions followed in 1758, 1761, and 1783[^22]. This declaration was a significant turning point: previously, very little organised dissent of slavery had existed, let alone from a religious group. The developments in attitudes and the change that this caused was not seen for some years, but the role that the 1727 declaration played, along with other quaker dissent (the vast majority of pre-1772 anti-slavery documents had been produced by Quakers[^23]), had longer-term effects that played a major role in the abolition of slavery: on the 22^nd^ of May 1787, Quakers played a foundational role in the creation of the 'Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade' (Henceforth referred to as 'the society'). The foundational principles and the purpose of this society were defined by the 1727 proclamation[^24]. Along with Thomas Clarkson, Granville Sharp, and Philip Sansom, nine founding quakers made up this society. After its foundation, the society inspired a series of local movements to spring up, creating a network of abolitionist campaigners across the country[^25]. This network was vital in furthering abolitionism into the public eye, circulating anti-slavery literature, promoting the sales of memorabilia (perhaps the most famous example of which is the 'Am I not a man and a brother?' medallion), organising boycotts and lectures, and crucially, gathering signatures to append to anti-slavery petitions presented to Parliament[^26]. A structured organisation system was needed, and the society was the very thing to bring about change and to bring the abolitionist cause to light. Drawing support from all corners of society, the society was able to gather massed public support, and present it to parliament through Sharp and Clarkson. The Quakers (and the three evangelical Christians) played an enormous part in the organisation and mobilisation of the abolitionist campaign, and thus were a cornerstone of the struggle for abolition. In addition to this, the Quakerâs enthusiasm for abolition was taken up by other religious organisations as well: the Clapham Sect (a major abolitionist movement) was founded by some of those who had founded the Society, and Methodists were also strongly in favour of abolition as a result of the influence of the Quakers: the Methodist Conference told Methodists before the 1830 General Election to use their vote to help secure abolition[^27]. The 1727 declaration was an important turning point in itself, as were the subsequent resolutions by the Quaker movement, because of the long-term changes that it brought throughout the 18^th^ century, indirectly resulting in the abolition of slavery.

Another major turning point in the abolition of slavery was the passing of the Great Reform Act (The Representation of the People Act) in 1832. It served as an attempt to enfranchise much of the population of Britain, creating 67 new constituencies[^28] and giving a significant proportion of the middle and upper classes the right to vote. Previously, voting had been limited to upper classes, and the electorate had had little independence or power over the candidates which they elected. The Great Reform Act gave both of these things to an expanded electorate, and now, more than ever, would a popular cause such as abolition be influential in the electoral system[^29]. The new House of Commons contained no less than 104 MPs who had pledged to support motions for immediate emancipation of slaves[^30]. Whilst there was some stalling on the part of certain anti-emancipation campaigners and those who desired a compensatory solution to emancipation (in which Planters would be compensated for their âlossâ), direct lobbying of ministers ensured that the government would legislate for emancipation: Lord Althorp committed to introducing emancipatory measures to the house by the 23^rd^ of April 1833[^31] (although this was postponed to the 14^th^ May). These measures would, after some debate and concessions from both sides of the argument, form the basis of the 1833 Abolition of Slavery Act. The admittance of staunch abolitionists to Parliament in the ensured that the movement was able to promote their views and force the hand of the government. It must also be considered, however, that the pressure placed on the government was not entirely from those within Parliament. There was a significant amount of external pressure placed on Members by their constituents: after 15 April, the number of petitions received by Parliament rose to, on average, 75 per day, where they had previously received no more than 150[^32]. The anti-slavery movement which existed outside of Parliament can be argued to have exerted considerably more influence on Members. This limitation is, however, mitigated, as there is a strong case for the argument that the Great Reform Act ensured that these petitions were heeded, because Members had much greater accountability than previously. Even within the House of Lords, where pressure such as this did not exist, Henry Taylorâs assumption that they âWould shrink from the unpopularity which the rejection or essential modification of it would bring upon themâ was correct[^33]. We may therefore conclude that the Great Reform Act was a major turning point in the struggle for the abolition of slavery, because without it, it is likely that emancipatory measures would not have been passed due to opposition within Parliament.

In conclusion, I find the 1832 Great Reform Act to be the most important turning point in the struggle for abolition. This is because, without its passage, the popular support for abolition would not have been represented in Parliament, nor would many Members have heeded it. This would have likely prevented the abolition of slavery for many years, if not decades. Whilst the influence of the Somerset vs Stewart case in setting legal precedent, the quaker-established abolition movement, and the Haitian revolution were also important turning points, none had the effect on the image of slavery that led to its abolition that the 1807 slave trade act did.
