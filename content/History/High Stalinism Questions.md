# High Stalinism Questions


### What period was High Stalinism?

1945-1953, i.e. end of WWII until Stalin’s death

</br>

### What defines High Stalinism?

Political centralisation around Stalin, cultural purges, growth of terror, the pinnacle of Stalin’s dictatorial power.

</br>

### What political concerns did Stalin have in post-war Russia?

Stalin was concerned that the party apparatus and membership made the party unwieldly and unreliable, and the reputation of the Red Army and its generals was high enough to be a threat to his power base.

</br>

### What actions did Stalin take to resolve these political concerns?

Stalin dismantled wartime institutions, demoting Zhukov to a lower position in Odessa. Major political figures with enough influence to be a concern were played off against each other, e.g. Zhdanov challenged Malenkov, who was then condemned to be replaced by Zhdanov as Stalin’s closest advisor.

</br>

### What happened to Zhdanov, and what does his treatment in the party suggest about Stalin’s power?

Zhdanov and his supporters were demoted after further disagreements with Malenkov. Malenkov himself was reappointed to the secretariat. This suggests that Stalin was very fickle, and that he did not want anyone in power for too long, lest they gain enough standing to challenge him for the leadership. This shows that Stalin’s power was perhaps weaker than it seemed.

</br>

### How did Stalin reduce the power of the government and party?

Stalin used his role as Head of Government and Head of the Party to regularly bypass both government and party apparatus, instead utilising his power over the private secretariat.

### Had the political power of Stalin changed post-1945 in comparison to that of 1928-41?

Stalin had centralised his power even further than it had been in 1941, and the ‘cult of personality’ that surrounded him was at its peak. Now, more than ever, was he surrounded by ‘yes-men’ who would compete for the privilege of carrying out his will.

### What was Zhdanovschina?

A cultural purge of all western thought, ideas, and influence, stressing conformity to socialist ideals. Everything western was condemned as bourgeois and decadent. It brought a return to socialist realism. 

</br>

### What kind of cultural works were targeted by Zhdanovschina?

The works of Tchaikovsky were censored, as he was accused of ‘rootless cosmopolitanism’. Prokofiev’s works were criticised for being ‘anti-socialist’. Eisenstein (director of *October*) was criticised because he had portrayed the bodyguards of the Tsar as thugs, and Dostoevsky’s works were censored for the lack of socialist qualities in his heroes. All scholarship that did not conform to marxist ideas was dismissed, even in the fields of maths and the sciences.

</br>

### What impact did Zhdanovschina have on Soviet society?

Society was entirely blocked off from any western influence: foreign newspapers were unobtainable, radio transmissions were jammed, only pro-soviet foreign writers and artists were allowed to visit the USSR, and very few soviet citizens were allowed to go to the west. Such isolationism was an attempt to make society in the USSR almost entirely ‘Soviet’.
</br>

### How did security concerns, due to the cold war, affect the use or terror?

Terror was disproportionately used on those suspected of western leanings or influence, attempting to ensure unwavering loyalty to the regime. Even the slightest interaction with a  foreigner, especially one with western sympathies, could be damning and the perpetrator could be charged and sent to a gulag.

</br>

### How was the NKVD reorganised?

The NKVD was split into two separate ministries: the MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) controlled domestic security and the penal system, and the MGB (Ministry of State Security - forerunner of the KGB) was in charge of counter-terrorism and espionage.

### How extensive was the post war terror?

The post-war terror was not as large as in the 1930s, but tens of thousands were still arrested annually, accused of ‘counter-revolutionary activities’. Approximately 12 million wartime survivors were sent to the gulags for hard labour.

### What was the Leningrad Case (1949)?

Stalin took a stand against the Leningrad party, who were becoming more autonomous and independent. Using falsified evidence, officials were arrested, including a politburo members, of which four were executed

</br>
### How did Stalin treat Jewish Russians?

When Israel turned out to be a pro-USA state, Stalin reverted to an anti-semitic stance. A mysterious accident killed the director of the Jewish theatre in Moscow, and the Jewish wives of Molotov and Kalinin were arrested in 1949.
