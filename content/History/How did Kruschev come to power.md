# How did Krushchev come to power?

</br>

### Who were the main threats to Krushchev?

The main threats to Krushchev were Molotov, Bulganin, Malenkov and Beria:

- **Molotov**: Long-standing member of the Bolshevik party, joined in 1906. Became secretary of the General Committee in 1921, and was promoted to the Politburo in 1926. Made Commissar of Foreign Affairs in May 1939. He, Malenkov, and Beria formed a collective leadership after Stalin’s death (March 1953). 

- **Bulganin:** Began his career as a Cheka officer in 1918. Made chairman of the Moscow Soviet in 1931, and subsequently held the roles of Premier of the Russian Republic, the chairman of the state bank, deputy premier of the Soviet Union, and a full member of the Central Committee. After Stalin’s death, Bulganin moved into the post of Defense Minister. He was an ally of Krushchev, but was still a threat.

- **Malenkov**: Joined the Red Army as a volunteer in 1918, and the party in 1920. Prior to WWII, he worked in the Orguburo. During the war, he supervised aircraft production and nuclear weapon development. Clashed with Zhdanov and Zhukov. Was part of the 5 man defence committee during the war, and was made Deputy PM under Stalin. He became a full member of the presidium in 1946. Combined two roles (Secretary of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers) but was forced to step down very soon after he had created his new role. Aided Krushchev in conspiring to arrest Beria.

- **Beria**: Joined the Communist Party in 1917. Made his career in the secret police, and replaced Yezhov as head of the NKVD. Personally oversaw the purges in Azerbaijan and Georgia. Became deputy prime minister in February 1941. Was conspired against, and arrested. Executed in December 1953.

### What was the role of Party and Government in the struggle?

The backing of the Party was invaluable in the struggle: Krushchev gained this backing after his Virgin Lands scheme (aiming to reduce grain shortages), and a rising in East Berlin, and was given the position of First Secretary. His control of the party allowed him to assert its dominance over the Police and the Government.

### How did Krushchev remove threats?

Krushchev removed threats largely by political plotting: he removed Beria by scheming with Malenkov and then moving to remove him. After accusations of criminal activity, he had Beria arrested and subsequently executed. Rather than simple purges, this was a thought-out political manoeuvre. He also used positions within the party to remove power from others: he removed Bulganin from the position of Premier by taking it himself, and did similar with Malenkov and Molotov, sometimes placing his own puppets in these positions to maintain control.

### When could Krushchev feel he had won the power struggle?

Krushchev could only feel that he had won the power struggle when he was no longer reliant on others. Zhukov and Bulganin were removed from their positions through propraganda, Molotov, Malenkov and Kaganovich were sent away and given humiliating jobs, and eventually Krushchev was able to hold the position of General Secretary, meaning that the top two jobs in both the party and the government were his (similarly to Stalin’s power base).
