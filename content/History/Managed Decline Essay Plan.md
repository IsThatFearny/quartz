# Managed Decline Essay Plan
</br>

### For 

- Withdrawal East of Suez - active military presence was too costly, and the ability to be realistic and to withdraw in good time demonstrated clear management of decline
- Continuation of nuclear deterrent whilst cutting back in other defence areas
- Entering the EEC independently

</br>

### Against

- 15 years of embarrassment in Rhodesia and South Africa, caused by a lack of British involvement in the commonwealth - US ended the situation in Rhodesia
- Special relationship was strained - Wilson’s lack of anything but moral support in the Vietnam war, disassociation from blanket bombing, the withdrawal east of suez, US prevented from using UK bases to supply during Yom Kippur war (for fear of OPEC sanctions, which were levied anyway) - honest broker status refused by LBJ
- EEC entry required significant concessions

</br>

## To what extent did the period 1964-79 see managed decline in UK foreign policy?
</br>

### LOE 1: Yes, the UK did see managed decline - foreign policy reorientation away from the special relationship was carefully controlled

- Joining the EEC in January 1973 moved focus from the special relationship to Europe
- Lack of military support for the Vietnam war, disassociation from blanket bombing, the refusal to supply US forces at UK bases during the Yom Kippur war - all of these demonstrate a deliberate and calculated adjustment in foreign policy
- Maintenance of Polaris contract and 1979 negotiation by Callaghan for Trident in Guadeloupe re-emphasised significant independence from the US

</br>

### LOE 2: Yes, the UK did see managed decline - decolonisation and the decline of Britain as a military force was well-managed and done with intent

- Healey’s 1966 white paper cut defence spending significantly and planned to phase out aircraft carriers - intentional, and with the maintenance of the Polaris program ongoing, was not a complete loss of power
- Decolonisation in the 1960s (Gambia in 1965, Botswana in 1966, and Swaziland in 1968) was an example of foreign policy that was carefully thought out and well-planned
- Improved relations with China facilitated the treaty for the secession of Hong Kong

</br>

### LOE 3: No, the UK did not see managed decline - foreign policy was made in response to international events, rather than as a carefully planned process, and the decline of influence was largely due to other agents

- Wilson’s attempt to act as ‘honest broker’ during the cold war was not taken seriously by the Soviets, and LBJ would not allow Britain to mediate - considerable loss of influence unmanaged by Britain
- Withdrawal east of suez was a direct response to devaluation and lack of funding - whilst promoted as a managed process, it was simply a measure to prevent going into massive debt
- Wilson’s attempt in 1967 to join the EEC was vetoed by de Gaulle.
- UDI by Rhodesian white minority and apartheid in South Africa demonstrated that Britain was no exercising any control over these commonwealth countries - this alienated other members of the commonwealth, and Britain’s authority and influence was significantly damaged - Wilson’s agreement to meet Smith aboard HMS Tiger in 1966 seemed to legitimise Smith’s position - Rhodesia issue would only be solved by the US
- Entry into the EEC and treaty of Brussels required heavy concessions from Britain, due to her weakness in negotiations - this was a failure for Heath which had to be resolved later by Thatcher
