  abstract = {The West as it stands today, has a long illustrious history of many feats, yet it makes a gruesome mistake of de-linking its past from a period of almost a thousand years by calling it the "Dark Ages". In recent times this trend has undergone some change and efforts have been made to restore that period to a more respectable status. However, still the best that could be achieved in terms of nomenclature is "Middle Ages." The present article is an endeavour to highlight the grandeur of the period that became the cause and source for later European developments on the one hand, and finding the reasons and factors responsible for the attempt to relegate the entire era as unworthy of notice and credit. Among one of those outstanding reasons was the rise, spread and influence of Islam, which for a very long period was the envy of the world, particularly in comparison to the so called "Dark Ages" of Europe. It came up with its own learning and culture, science and philosophy, medicine and statecraft, architecture and commerce that were unique in every way but were reluctantly accepted and hardly appreciated. Yet the impact could not be denied and remains a fact of history even if western authorship has continued to overlook the significance of it.},

  abstract = {The current historical consensus is that English common law was somewhat confused, but that coerced servitude was legal in England before 1772, and certainly in its empire, where English law on slavery did not reach, because it was ``beyond the line'' of English justice. The common law is characterized by an effort to see continuity and consistency, and historians (despite our natural desire to track change) often look for those patterns too. Such efforts to provide a consistent overview of an England that was free and colonies that created slavery on their own---have obscured the vibrant struggle over slavery within the English judicial system---the common law---over more than a century. Not only did the common law on slavery change profoundly during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: the common law became an instrument of crown policy. It did so within a federal empire, wherein colonial legal norms had to adhere, in crucial ways, to that common law. English high court judges thus provided the legal foundation for an imperial common law of slavery that allowed people to be deemed absolute property. That definition of people as property was closely connected to absolutism, both in theory and practice. In theory the absolute power of kings over subjects was connected to that of masters over slaves. In practice, the crown's use of the courts to create laws without parliamentary consent (to bypass parliament) also increased crown revenue and thus their independence from parliamentary control. These powerful legal mechanisms made it possible to ``recover'' enslaved people as assets for debts, a legal definition that was essential for a market in people to function sucessfully. This history reveals the absolutist character of early capitalism, and the extent to which the character of capitalist development depends on the legal rules that define markets and justice.},

  abstract = {Recent scholarship has demonstrated that the language of subjective natural rights can be found in a wide variety of medieval juristic and scholastic texts. This is part of a general trend in the study of political ideas that stresses the continuity between medieval and modern political values. However, many leading scholars of medieval political ideas maintain that no language of subjective natural rights can be found in Aquinas's political writings, based as they are on a famous objective definition of right (jus) as the object of justice (justitia). Other scholars argue that Aquinas's notion of subjective rights is peripheral to his political philosophy. The essay argues that Aquinas, while commenting on canon law texts, explicitly posits a subjective natural right to marry, based on the natural equality and natural liberty of all human beings. This can be seen by his claim that a slave may contract marriage, even without the consent of the master. This is one example of an instance in which Aquinas refers to specific legal issues in order to explicate his understanding of liberty and right. For Aquinas there are certain areas of liberty or mastery (dominium) that are exempt from all human authority, and wherein a person has rights to decide how to pursue natural human goods.},

It argues that abstraction in these thinkers should be interpreted in causal terms, as an act whereby images in the imagination, through the power of the agent intellect, educe their intelligible likeness in a receptive intellect. This Averroean-Thomistic causal approach to abstraction offers an intriguing alternative to the usual approach to abstraction as an epistemological content-sorting. The article also demonstrates the extensive common ground uniting these thinkers' cognition theories, despite Aquinas's well-known rejection of Averroes's theory of separate Intellects.},

Plantation owners, shipbuilders, and merchants connected with the slave trade accumulated vast fortunes that established banks and heavy industry in Europe and expanded the reach of capitalism worldwide. Eric Williams advanced these powerful ideas inCapitalism and Slavery, published in 1944. Years ahead of its time, his profound critique became the foundation for studies of imperialism and economic development. Binding an economic view of history with strong moral argument, Williams's study of the role of slavery in financing the Industrial Revolution refuted traditional ideas of economic and moral progress and firmly established the centrality of the African slave trade in European economic development. He also showed that mature industrial capitalism in turn helped destroy the slave system. Establishing the exploitation of commercial capitalism and its link to racial attitudes, Williams employed a historicist vision that set the tone for future studies.},

Extraordinary aspects of its history are overlooked, particularly the many gains made by its inhabitants - slaves of African origin, who not only created the great wealth that enabled France to develop capitalism, but also managed to abolish slavery and achieve national independence. This article argues that it is essential to understand the Haitian Revolution, over 200 years after its triumph, in order to reflect upon the profound social importance of this event led by slaves - a feature that explains its peculiarities, historical significance and the stigma that it and the Haitian nation have suffered.},

  abstract = {The Haitian Declaration of Independence on January 1, 1804, explicitly challenged long-standing systems of European colonialism and slavery in the Caribbean. In the complex diplomatic and economic negotiations between Haiti's first leader, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and the lieutenant governor of Jamaica, George Nugent, the two sought to answer unprecedented questions in the months before and after Dessalines's rebel forces defeated the French army. Nugent considered how British officials would regulate trade between British merchants and Haitians but was concerned that Haitian merchants and sailors would spread the spirit of rebellion throughout the New World. Could slavery and universal freedom coexist in the Caribbean without dramatic consequences for the British Empire? The full documentary evidence of how both sides aggressively pursued their objectives during 1803 and 1804 casts a new light on why Atlantic world empires and nations settled on policies of diplomatic isolation for Haiti by the end of the first decade of the nineteenth century. The Haitian Declaration of Independence raised profound questions about revolutionary legitimacy and national sovereignty and drastically expanded the ideals of the age of revolutions.},

  abstract = {This article reconsiders the sugar duties controversy in early Victorian Bntain. Rather than representing the defeat of abolitionism by free trade zeal, the sugar question was a contest of two varieties of anti-slavery thought which had previously co-existed: one believing that slavery's immorality was accompanied by its productive infer{\`i}onty to fr{\'e}e labour and the other asserting that slavery's profits in this world were punished outside the marketplace. West Indian decline after the end of protection led to a revision of free labour super{\`i}or{\`i}ty, with providential externalities replacing marketplace competitiveness. The episode demonstrates how little most Butons understood the welfare of blackfieedmen to be connected to anti-slavery after emancipation. A fuller appreciation of the slave sugar debate furthermore recovers an important abolitionist strand in the new turnan 'history' of free trade.},

  abstract = {Thomism is a philosophical-theological movement or school essentially inspired by the thought of Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274), a Dominican master, traditionally called Doctor Communis or Doctor Angelicus. His doctrine is an original synthesis of Roman Catholic theology and a philosophical system based on Aristotelian, Neoplatonic, Roman, Arabic, and Jewish thought. Thomism in its original and authentic form distinguished very precisely between theological and philosophical knowledge or method. In philosophy, Thomism only used rational arguments, with the aim of providing, if possible, a universal philosophical interpretation of reality, neither relying on religious belief nor contradicting Christian Revelation or Catholic Doctrine (Kristeller 1974a, 843--844). With the development of a Thomist presence at the universities, especially in northern Italy, this school also received the designation of the Via Thomae, as opposed to the Via Scoti, a term reserved for those holding the teaching chair reserved for the Scotists (Tavuzzi 1992, 133; Kristeller 1974a, 855). Some key characteristics of Thomism's development in the Renaissance were contact with Italian Aristotelianism, especially in its Averroist form; a highly evolved scholastic terminology; rigorous philosophical logic; polemics against the Albertist and Nominalist schools (influenced by Scotism), and later against Molinism (Luis de Molina d. 1600) and an alternative interpretation of Aquinas's thought -- especially the one proposed by Francisco Su{\'a}rez (d. 1617). Typical works by Renaissance Thomists include the commentaries on Aquinas's works and commentaries on the Corpus Aristotelicum in the form of questions, a new type of philosophical work -- the Compendium and also the Cursus -- and systematic expositions of all philosophical disciplines in the Aristotelian order and following Aquinas's interpretation. After 1492, with the Spanish colonization of the New World, Thomism made an important contribution to the development of international law and human rights, on the foundation of natural law.},

In the present study, upper and lower bounds for period life tables for plantation slaves in Trinidad are estimated from data on 17,087 slaves, collected during the Trinidad slave registrations of 1813 and 1816. In addition, many of the pivotal demographic queries raised during the parliamentary debate on the abolition of the slave trade and the emancipation of slaves are finally resolved by the application of life tables with covariates--hazard models--to the Trinidad slave registration data.},

Whereas the setup of the settlement to be established by the Frankfurt Land Company was to be patterned on feudal models and thus included the concept of servants, it did not include that of slaves. The fact that slavery was an accepted custom in the New World seems to have bothered prospective German (and Dutch) emigrants. It is significant that the protesters did not base their protest so much on the love and fear of God (as earlier documents by Quakers did), but specifically on justice, equality and humanitarianism. It is shown that overall, slave ownership was rare among early German immigrants},

Koenigsberger paints a detailed picture of the Reformation and its significance as increasingly powerful nations began to intrude on their subjects' public and private lives. He gives account of the Counter-Reformation and the political and economic crisis that accompanied it, and an in-depth discussion of the age of Louis XIV and the balance of power in Europe. A full chapter addresses the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, and throughout attention is given to social, cultural and intellectual developments. The book concludes with a summary of the situation throughout Europe on the eve of the French Revolution, and the dramatic changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution and the beginnings of a consumer society.},

  abstract = {The year 1944 saw the publication of Capitalism and Slavery in the United States. Authored by Eric Williams, a young colonial West Indian Negro and professor at Howard University, the book shattered conventional wisdom by intertwining and recasting the histories of European industrialization, African enslavement, and abolitionism. Though Williams's three-quarter century old work has been often reprinted and remains revered as something of a bible among postcolonial radicals, it has suffered a form of blasphemy in recent years. An influential and growing body of US-based historical studies invested in ``rethinking capitalism and slavery'' has cited the old study in ways that misrepresents its contentions. Capitalism and Slavery has been miscomprehended in books like Empire of Cotton: A Global History (2014) by Sven Beckert, The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism (2014) by Edward E. Baptist, Empire of Necessity: Slavery, Freedom and Deception in the New World (2016) by Greg Grandin, and River of Dark Dreams: Slavery and Empire in the Cotton Kingdom (2015) by Walter Johnson. This scholarship, though impressive in many regards, twists out of Williams' text a thesis that he never proposed. Extending a North Atlantic tradition that dates to the 1960s', the authors have tied Williams to a claim about the ``incompatibility'' between capitalism and slavery that is entirely at odds with his argument. Ultimately the new Americanist efforts to rethink the relationship between capitalism and slavery have wound up ``throwing shade'' on Williams' writing rather than illuminating it.},

In light of the enormous impact Capitalism and Slavery has had on the abolition literature, it is surprising that historians engaged in this particular facet of the "Williams debate" have not invoked this earlier work. Williams, in his dissertation, makes it clear that there were three different, but overlapping economic and political-economic forces that undermined Britain's slave system in the late-eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. First, he explains that in the years leading up to the abolition of the British slave trade (1807), British sugar growers faced economic distress due to foreign competition and a subsequent collapse in sugar prices. Secondly, he observes that this downturn in the plantation's profitability was cotemporaneous with the decline in the sugar sector's relevance to the British economy, as Britain's domestic industrial sector expanded. Lastly, Williams argues that policy makers turned against the sugar planters' cherished colonial system and embraced a freer trade policy in the mid-1820s. Because of the liberalized commerce with Latin America, in particular, the United Kingdom was able to emancipate its own slaves and still enjoy the fruits of other nations' enslaved labor.},
